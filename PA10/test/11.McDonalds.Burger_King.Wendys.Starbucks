No wait inside but receiving our order seemed to take longer than necessary.  I asked about the Elliot & McClintock location and didn't get any info about that store bit did learn this location is moving East to Elliot & Priest around August/Spetember.

REVIEW #2:  3 stars  (104 chars)
They usually have a long wait time in drive through when it's busy. Other than that, the service is good

REVIEW #3:  2 stars  (480 chars)
It's been 8 minutes and counting and they STILL haven't taken my order. Joy I'm gonna be late for wk this AM *thanks* McDonalds on 51 & Elliot! ...  ... ------------------------- ... UPDATE ...  ... It took another 8 minutes to get my food that day for a total of 16 minutes to get out of there and YES I was late.  I do have to say that I did go back once since then and this time my order was quicker but they didn't have any customers so I'm not sure that's improvement or not.

REVIEW #4:  2 stars  (266 chars)
Not bad. clean, not busy. Food was as good as McDonald's gets. The only bad thing is that the employees were yelling and fighting in the back. Kinda funny but really unprofessional considering the age of them and that the manager was standing there laughing at them.

REVIEW #5:  1 stars  (720 chars)
I used to go to this location for breakfast, until the day they gave me a raw egg!   ... The sad thing is that this is the second time this has happened at this location.  I even made sure to tell them to cook the egg all the way through, so you can imagine my shock and utter disgust when I bit into the breakfast sandwich and the yolk began running down my hand!  ... I said I will NEVER go back to that McDonalds because obviously there is an issue with making sure food is thoroughly cooked. ... I did call the manager to inform him of the issue, and he was nice, but nice doesn't change the fact that the staff can't seem to prepare an egg properly.  I don't want to get sick because of someone else's incompetence.

REVIEW #6:  1 stars  (568 chars)
This particular McDonalds just sucks. I've only ever gone through the drive-thru because this one is closest to home, and in the maybe half dozen times I've done so, there's always been something wrong with my order, missing, or just cold. Last week I decided to go again before I had to go into work- at this point there was a line of 4 ahead of me. I saw this as a good thing because I figured I'd get some hot fries- wrong! I waited almost 20 mins in line got cold fries, old chicken nuggets and rushed service. This is the last time I hit this Mickey D's up again.

REVIEW #7:  1 stars  (133 chars)
We drove to this McDonald location and we were shocked to find it closed. A sign was posted redirecting customer to another location.

REVIEW #1:  4 stars  (571 chars)
this McDonald's is one of the busiest ones in the valley.  Service & Cleanliness can be 100% spot on... And then they get hit with a zillion kids and/or movie goers.  In 30 minutes the place looks like it's gone to hell in a hand basket.   So one minute service is just peachy, another and they don't seem to have enough employees.. But there will be lines out of the double laned drive up  window and crowds around the counter...  As a regular there, they do an admirable job but will always have nay sayers at this and similar locations... of any fast food restaurants.

REVIEW #2:  3 stars  (120 chars)
They just got a face lift.  The place looks good and 2 drive thurs lanes now.  Still the same good and level of service.

REVIEW #3:  2 stars  (116 chars)
Dirty, tables not clean. No mirror in bathroom.  Very surprised. Usually the best place to stop for clean facilities

REVIEW #4:  1 stars  (379 chars)
Awful service and such a slow drive thru.  ... Not coming back. ...  ... Ordered a smoothie and they let me order, pay, and wait at the other window until they figured out they don't have any...  ... I sat at the drive thru window several minutes before someone even opened it and acknowledged me and there was a line behind me!  ... They definitely don't move with much purpose.

REVIEW #5:  1 stars  (182 chars)
Horrible service for being a fast food chain. Horrible drive thru for late night eating. I'd rather go to the McDonalds on 99th and lower buckeye. Never want to come back here. Ever!

I'd say this place is good, they try to do well each day. The only thing is that when I order my ice coffee and nothing else, I end up waiting a little too long to get my coffee. I understand they give orders in chronologically but having to wait only for a drink and no food. I feel that I can get my drink quicker. Get the ones who only have a beverage out and on their way. You will a lot more happier customers that much more. Keep up your smiles, that are welcoming. Thank you

This is the McD's in the Walmart.  Been here a couple of times, but it was mediocre at best.  Was at this "wonderful" shopping location and decided to pick up some fries.  While in there we grabbed a couple of doubles to go as well.  When we got home the food was actually warm including the fries.  This particular experience was not that bad.  The dining area was still messy as it always looks when we walk through the store.  Not a place we frequent often, nor plan to.  However, this time was not all that bad.

REVIEW #4:  3 stars  (157 chars)
This is the McDonald's inside the Wal-Mart store.  Nothing special but we still use this one due to the fact the freestanding one across the street is awful.

REVIEW #5:  1 stars  (1085 chars)
Worst mcdonalds service ever. Walked in and there were already customers standing with complaints about their order. While I waited in line, one if the girls working the drinks, made my hazelnut coffee and set it down. A minute later, the same girl pours my coffee in a smaller cup, tosses out the rest and starts drinking it. When my order was complete, my drink was nowhere to be found. All of this while I'm standing there waiting for my order. The person working my order starts apologizing about how the drink was just right there a second ago so I told her that i know and that the other girl just drank it right in front of me. This got everyone's attention since there are so many people behind that counter just standing around. So the girl who drank my coffee starts making another one as she tells this other girl what I just said. So that girl looks right at me and states "that one". I was very annoyed but at that point I just wanted my coffee. Maybe it's just me but I expect better service even if they are little kids; show some courtesy and atleast act like an adult.

Luckily, I beat the rush, because after I ordered, there was a huge line behind me. I was craving chicken nuggets, so I ordered that and some French fries. Chicken nuggets were great, but the fries were unusually salty, limp, and soggy :/. I love the convenience though and the staff was nice and smiling.

REVIEW #2:  1 stars  (316 chars)
I went to get lunch around 10:26 and there's always some kind of hassle with these people. The rude woman in drive thru said we're not serving lunch right now. But when I went to the same place 3 weeks ago they started serving it at 10:20 WTF ???? I left this dump. What a lousy way to start the day. Cocksuckers !!!

REVIEW #3:  1 stars  (155 chars)
They can NEVER get your order right! The staff is rude, but if you call to complain they leave you on hold forever!! Won't waste another dime in this DUMP!

I hate to waste time reviewing mcdonalds but this one does have the best frapps of any I've been to. Also the new Mc D's style inside is nicer than the ugly throw up decor they used to have. That's all...

REVIEW #2:  3 stars  (534 chars)
Ya'll know what McDonald's is, yar bugger. If you've absolutely got to have your mayo and fried food fix, this McD's will suffice. It's average. It's not a stay-away-at-all-costs McD's, and it's not the superstar McD's that I'm sure exists somewhere. ...  ... It's new-ish and still in good shape. Nice people. No kiddie play area. Comical dual drive-through, one of whose lanes is blocked off half the time, probably to prevent the drive-through rage that ensues when the person in the next lane cuts you off when it was "your turn".

People are nice but this is the slowest mcdonalds ever

REVIEW #4:  1 stars  (641 chars)
Went here today about 4:30 pm. Asked for fries with no salt. Never had a problem any where else but, apparently here it's an issue.  I received  plenty of attitude from my cashier when asking for salt packets and ketchup. After being asked to pull up to Mcdonalds waiting lot. I told my gpa, watch she's gonna be a snot and not put the salt packets in.After 5 minutes our fries come out.. With of course intentionally no salt. My reasoning for the no salt my Gpa eat it.. But I can. So he eats his with no salt and I have mine with it. A little FYI for the Mcdonalds drive thu cashier, it's your job honey it's honestly not that complicated.

REVIEW #1:  5 stars  (1035 chars)
I don't usually both rating a fast food place.  But this was the nicest McDonald's I've seen in the US.  Nicest ever was McCaf in Brisbane where the waiter brings fresh chocolate croissants and espressos on fine china to your table.  So this isn''t the nicest ever but is still heads & shoulders above the others in town. ...  ... This location makes our local Starbucks look dumpy in comparison.  Check my photos.  Modern design throughout with a caf lounging area, touch screen video game corner for the tykes, pub tables, high-backed booths for privacy, blown glass sculptures and a chandelier.   Didn't use the restroom but would hazard a guess it is probably gorgeous as well. ...  ... Double lane drive-through jammed up at evening rush hour makes for a busy bee kitchen.  Folks were hustling hard.  Gotthe kids meals quickly.   And the wraps were a bit better stuffed than some of the other locations that really gyp you if you order them with grilled chicken.  My only regret was forgetting to order a coffee while I was there.

REVIEW #2:  5 stars  (223 chars)
Just to be fair. Contrary to othet posts, we take our kids there many times because we live nearby. Both dining in and drive through. Never any problems. The deco is great, upscale looking. Kids love the free archade games.

REVIEW #3:  3 stars  (366 chars)
Pretty nice as mcdonalds go. 4 is my standard review on a decent place. This one gets a 3 because of some drive-through mess ups. The biggest one was when I ordered a sausage and egg mcmuffin (and only that!) and instead got a bacon egg and cheese biscuit. Um...not the same thing, folks. Didn't realize until a few miles away when I got the chance to open it. Lame.

REVIEW #4:  1 stars  (169 chars)
I ordered the southern fried chicken sandwich from drive-thru, it came without ANY condiments on it.  Just a plain piece of chicken on a bun?  Come on guys, get it right

REVIEW #5:  1 stars  (372 chars)
Ordered a egg on a muffin. It had cheese. Ordered a coffee. Sticky caramel all over the cup. Not cool for a drive thru. I had to ask for something to clean my hands so I could drive. Employees have serious attitude. I'll avoid this location which is a bummer because it's convenient. It's just not worth the hassle. Every time we've been here, they've messed up the order.

REVIEW #6:  1 stars  (125 chars)
The drive thru screws up my order EVERY time. When I then have to park and go in, no one even apologizes. I avoid this place.

This is literally the worst mcdonald's I have ever gone to. In the last week I went to separate times to get an iced coffee before work in the morning. Only to be told that their machine is down for cleaning. Just a hint....AZ is hot at 6:30am and choosing to clean your coffee machines at 6 in the morning is ridiculous....... most people drink coffee when???? THE MORNING!!!

REVIEW #5:  1 stars  (382 chars)
This is the worst McD's we ever been and the slowest. Took them over 15 min to get our food and there weren't even busy. There were couple of other people waiting for their food and seem like they were pissed too because of the slow service and lack of care. There were bunch of young kids working there goofing around. Manager was there but didn't seem to care. AVOID THIS PLACE!!!

The burgers are cooked magnificently, and the master chefs have a way with the salads that can't just be beat. I also thank them for posting that sauces cost 10 cents extra - most other McDonalds don't have signage saying sauces cost extra. They often close early on weekends to give staff members extra family time.

Great slides for the three year old; haven't had a service issue, beyond typical fast food worker apathy. ... Oil needs to be chaned in the fryer. :-P

REVIEW #4:  3 stars  (309 chars)
This McDonald's is offset from the road a bit. Parking for dine-in or carry-out is quite convenient, but navigating into the drive through lane is a little tricky.  Watch out for people driving out as you try to enter.  Otherwise, it's a regular old McD's.  The staff were resonably friendly when I was there.

REVIEW #5:  2 stars  (257 chars)
Don't go through the drive through. They F you in the drive through. Multiple different times throughout 3 years, I have been F'ed consistently. Hamburgers with no meat (hard to validate when driving through). Missing items. Just go in and check your order.

REVIEW #6:  2 stars  (305 chars)
IF you go here for lunch don't park in area that is continuation of the drive thru.  ... One person taking orders = a line that rapidly grows and a longer wait for something that shouldn't require a wait. ...  The drive thru is typically the way I come through here and will be the only way from now on...

REVIEW #7:  2 stars  (382 chars)
My first time to this McDonalds in....well, I cant remember.  The service wasn't horrid.  It was a bit slow even considering the line through the drive through.  Maybe I was just tired and grumpy.... ...  ... I am a bit annoyed that I asked for dips for my McNuggets and they gave me NONE.  Not the worst out there.  They may get another chance but I am far from wowed at this rate.

REVIEW #8:  1 stars  (254 chars)
First time they served me oatmeal in a cup. Second time they have no hot chocolate and I still had to wait in the drive thru. Unsure why the management staff is unable to order the right amount of inventory. Im not giving a 3rd chance to be disappointed.

REVIEW #9:  1 stars  (638 chars)
I do everything I can to avoid this place - but the little one likes the chicken nuggets so [we] go when there's a need.  Service continues to deteriorate.  If there is a school night there - forget it.  They can't keep up with whose order is whose, the staff is not prepared for that load.  They never get orders right so I constantly have to appeal to a child who doesn't like mustard on their hamburger.  They are so ghetto - they give old toys in their happy meals - really?!  Like my kid is stupid and doesn't know what it is supposed to be thanks to ads, signage, and what not.  Please do yourself a favor and do not go to this McD.

REVIEW #10:  1 stars  (239 chars)
My son has been going there with his friends and though its different times of the day, he has been finding hair in his food. That's fucking disgusting. I hope this place goes out of business. ...  ... My family will never eat there again.

REVIEW #11:  1 stars  (688 chars)
Worst customer service ever, esp from 7pm onward. The lady asking us our order in the drive thru didnt know what chicken selects were or if they even served small drinks. I thought it was a joke or something until i got to the window to see one of the dumbest human beings in the world. She didnt ask me for my card, apologize for being rude/ignorant to her own menu, and just flirted with a co worker during the entire transaction. I know its minimum wage at a mcdonalds but Jesus wept this location needs better employees. As a manager of a retail establishment i was appalled at their customer service, and my wife was disgusted with their attitudes. At least the fries were luke warm.

I like mcdonalds. My favorites are the cheeseburger or quarter pounder.   I usually feel guilty whenever I eat fast food but the one thing I don't feel guilty about is their sundaes.  My favorite is the caramel.  It takes me back to my childhood when my dad would take us for a treat.  I don't know if it's the memories that make it better but it doesn't matter.  I savor the treat and the memories.

Fortunately, I didn't have the pleasure of experiencing the inside but I did however get to hang out with the drive thru crew at McD Union 3185. Not so customer friendly voice promoted me to make a selection and I quickly warmed her heart with my awesomeness and she changed her tune to a more friendlier approach. Strolled around the the corner to the 1st window to pay the "man". 2 gift cards (Only reason I was even here) & a couple bucks later I was prepping my next 10' journey to the 2nd window for this ever so delectable healthy American delicacy.  ...  ... Funny story, guy hands me back the empty gift cards & my debit card. I'm in the process of putting them away and he informs me in a very magoo manner that I'll have to go to the next window for my food. So I kindly asked him about napkins & straws. "Next window" So just 1 more for all times sake-ketchup?.... (which I hate and asked at the ordering screen for no ketchup and he says "that's at the next window too". Not really sure if he was catching on with my subtleness but hey, he opened that can of worms....  ...  ... Got that piping hot back of cholesterol and carbonation and I quickly pulled into the parking lot to find out if I won TASTE BUD RUSSIAN ROULETTE & I did!!!! Both me & my little helper got exactly what I ordered. Don't know if its excellent bagger paying attention skills or just dumb luck. Either way I'll take that anyway when you roll the dice at a Mickey D's

I went through the drive through today at this location to get some Iced Mochas.  I really wanted Dunkin but with the construction on Alma School I didn't have time so I settled.  First of all, my two large Iced mochas cost me $8!  Starbucks prices, no where near Starbucks quality.  (Dunkin would have been about $3 cheaper--and way better) So I order the Mochas, one non-fat.  I get to the pick-up window, after waiting for the 2 cars in front of me to get their food, and they ask me to park,,,FOR COFFEE!!!!!! So I do.  I live in AZ, it is HOT here. I waited, and waited, and waited...3 cars get their food.  Im hot, so I go inside to grab them.  A nice boy brought me my coffee and appologized (he was sweet).  I look at my mochas and one has carame one chocolate...What the hell?!?..so I go in and say "uh...I ordered Mochas." The worker said "Those are Mochas" in a snotty tone.  So I ask why one has chocolate and one caramel.  She told me the order taker put that in the system.  I told her I said one non-fat.  But I had to go the hubster had to go to work. She says "oh, sorry"  First of all...Why did two coffees take over 5 minutes to make?...Second...how does one get Caramel out of Non-Fat?  I can see getting chocolate and non fat mixxed up (maaaayyyybe)...This McDonalds is super rude..and always messes up orders..if you are going to be rude can you pallleeeaaase get my order right?

My husband, Jim W., teases me because I only have one and five star reviews.  I guess that's what it takes to motivate me.  Apparently, I was really motivated this morning at McDonald's. ...  ... No one over the age of eight goes to McDonald's for the food.  We either go because it's quick (sometimes) or cheap (not anymore) or convenient or because we are craving that childhood food memory.  So Jim and I met there this morning  (score one for convenient) for a quick snack and chat about the week. ...  ... While we're waiting for the food I notice a sign that says they have free samples on Monday morning.  I was fascinated by this.  Since when has McDonald's offered samples?  And who hasn't tried their potatoes and needs to know what they taste like?  Who doesn't know the taste of crunchy grease without a reminder?  So, curiosity getting the better of me, I asked for a sample.  I really wanted to see what it was.  That's when I was reminded where, exactly, I was. ...  ... I was told that there was no way I could have a sample.  When I inquired why that was I was informed that the person accompanying me had ordered what they were sampling. ...  ... Oh. ...  ... Though most yelpers know my prolific yelper husband, this woman did not.  In fact, she had no idea who he was in relation to me.  He could have been my husband but he could just as easily been an anal colleague who would rather die than allow me to sample his food, which I assume was the implication in her refusal. ...  ... Now, I acknowledge that this is a ridiculous nothing of an issue.  But these days I run into more and more silly little annoyances and I just couldn't let this one pass.  You see, the woman was very satisfied with herself, as if I was trying to "get over on the man" (i.e. McDonald's) and she thwarted me.  It's just so stupid.  So, I guess they saved themselves a quarter of a hash brown but they got this nifty review instead. ...  ... As to the biscuit I did eat, well ... it was McDonald's.

Slow as molasses and got my order wrong. I ordered one iced coffee with sugar-free vanilla. How do you mess that up? I was the only customer in the drive through and it wasn't busy inside. No excuse for the incompetence. After reading the other reviews, they just don't care here apparently.

The kids play area is NASTY! I like to come in to let my kids play so I can do my homework, but today the play area is terribly dirty. There is only 1 table that doesn't have garbage on it. I came in at 4 in the afternoon, and no one else was here. I don't understand why the play area is this dirty.  I will not be coming back to this play area, even though it is right next to my house. I will drive to another McDonalds.  Also, I ordered 2 waters and 3 yogurt parfaits, and it took forever. They didn't even have to make anything for me. They were all standing around talking to each other. I do not recommend this place for your kids to enjoy.

This is THE WORST Mcdonalds in the history of Mcdonalds. The fries are ALWAYS cold and old and same goes with chicken nuggets. None of the crew members speak English and if they do they are all very rude and don't know how to say hi or thank you or even have a great day. I actually drive 5 minutes to another Mcdonalds just because this one sucks so bad ( btw- I live next door to this one ). Please, do not come to this Mcdonalds.

This is a story about "going the extra mile"... ...  ... Which is exactly what I do when I drive an "extra mile" down the road to a different McDonald's location, instead of going to this, closer, more convenient one. ...  ... EVERY single time I have gone to this location they have messed something up. Wrong orders, forgotten items, miss-charged credit cards, are just a few of the things that this collection of knuckleheads consistently excels at.  ...  ... Save yourself some frustration, and go the extra-mile...down the road.

The employees can't smile, takes them forever to greet at the speaker,I received the wrong salad - called them from home - mgr said come back mention my name and we will replace the salad for you.  i went back the following evening and they flat out refused  to do anything- sorry we don't if this happened or not- the mgr is off today. Unbelievable!!!very poor training and employees don't care-most likely the mgr doesn't care either.

I come here occasionally as it is close to work and cheap eats.  I can't say I've really had some of the issues others have.  Food's been generally fine and seemed fresh within reason for fast food, the staff usually is cool and the wait time varies from eh to good. ...  ... The only thing that bugs me is you have to remember to ask for ketchup because they rarely if ever ask and I've yet to have them just give it to me.  I *LIKE* ketchup with my fries, dang it!

Run of the mill McDonald's which is one convenient exit & about two blocks off the freeway.  Appears to be a newer building with two ordering lanes.  There's a HUGE cactus for you to stare at while waiting for your order to come up.

REVIEW #3:  3 stars  (360 chars)
Two key points: ...  ... 1) It's new, so, it's still mostly clean and the grease traps haven't reached critical mass yet. ...  ... 2) If you're headed toward Tucson on I-10 east, this is really the last convenient place to get off before you get to Casa Grande exit 195 which is like a billion miles away. So if you're hungry GET OFF NOW. ...  ... That is all.

REVIEW #5:  1 stars  (942 chars)
I had no choice, but to choose a star. Over the years this Mc Donalds continues to disappoint.  I truly believe this franchise owner really does not care. This morning will be last time I go there. The people at my job have had similar dissapointing experiences with the same place. It is close and convenient for us. But they would rather go to another location nearby or somewhere close to their home, when commuting to work. This morning I ordered strawberry cream pie and was told again that they had none and asked if can be I would like apple pies instead. About fifteen minutes later at work. The apple pie was hard as a rock. More like a apple biscuit. This is the final straw. This place is horrible. The list of things that I have ordered over time is too long to list. Mc Donald Corp should pull their licensing away from owner. I have took time from my day to write this, rather than spending it on something else more productive.

This McDonald's can kiss it. And there servers. I only been here 3 times since its right around the corner form my work. I'd rather drive 10 miles to a good service and better food place then this. The service always sucks. The Piss inside lack communication and brains. As well as emotions. I think a robot could do better. And the food is always stale. Like its been under a heat lamp all day. Nasty fools.

REVIEW #2:  2 stars  (940 chars)
As with most fast food joints, this McDonalds is hit or miss.  I'd say about half the time I get out with exactly what I ordered and no strange encounters.   ...  ... The most common problem I've had here is getting sauce for my nuggets.  They usually ask when I'm ordering, but I've learned to double check when I get my bag anyway.  Once, they distracted me from checking for sauce by failing to give me a straw.  I got my straw, forgot the sauce.   ...  ... On one visit, the girl at the second window made it through our entire exchange without actually speaking to me or looking at me. ...  ... The food is consistently typical McDonalds food, which isn't good, but it's what I go to get.  The line tends to move quick with the double ordering lines.  The location couldn't be more convenient to my house, which is probably not a good thing.  Overall, it is exactly what I expect and I know the subsequent stomach ache is my own fault.

REVIEW #4:  1 stars  (1539 chars)
So I dropped in for a quick lunch and a soda the other day with a friend of mine.  We just wanted something small.  So I ordered two chicken sandwiches and two cokes.  The girl said something that was not understandable and I said, " What?  Say again?"  -- she said something garbled again.  I really hate those establishments that hire people who cannot speak English.  I finally figured out she was saying "do you want fries with that?".  So I said fries with only one of them.  So she rang me up and pointed to the cash register readout that said $8.68.  So I paid. ...  ... When they called my number, I got one sandwich, one small fries, and two small drinks.  I said that I ordered two sandwiches which the girl could not understand again.  So she had to call the Manager over and he told me that my order was for only one sandwich.  So I said, "$8.68 for one small sandwich (not even a premium sandwich), small fries, and small coke?".  So to get the other sandwich they charged me $4.90.  WTF??? Almost $14 for our snack/lunch?  Not only another example where you are better off going for a real lunch at places where you can get a lunch special for $5.99 or $6.99, and get good table service, and they have employees who can speak and comprehend the English language.  And even for fast food restaurants, JIB is better, cheaper, and higher in quality. ...  ... I normally do not frequent MacDonalds because I always thought they sucked.  But this place was convenient to my cause the other day, but I will now never go back again.

REVIEW #5:  1 stars  (323 chars)
The only reason they have my business is because I'm along for the ride already. Can't say they haven't messed up my order in some sort of way.  ... Those things including simple tasks like reading the order back, checking for all the items & even correct greetings. I know you can, I would like you to and make your money.

REVIEW #6:  1 stars  (753 chars)
Wow. Unbelievably disgusting customer service. I don't expect much except general courtesy and professionalism from any fast food place- and we received LESS than that today from Elizabeth Hernandez. She was disrespectful and absolutely unprofessional when I declined to donate a dollar to their fundraiser for kids. She said 'um okay well, it helps kids' while giving me a sideways look! I said I don't need you to belittle me because I don't donate to this cause, I help children every single day. And she replied, 'ya okay' and rolled her eyes at me! I cannot believe that. I will be taking it a step further and contacting corporate regarding her lack of customer service skills.... I'm pretty sure they don't want people representing them that way.

Ever see that film by Morgan Spurlock about McDonald's called "Super-Size Me?" I didn't eat at McDonald's for at least two years after being grossed out by that movie! That being said, my Wife and I were super tired, heading out for a camping weekend at night, and we needed something to eat. Along Shea Blvd there in Fountain Hills, there's Wendy's, which I have given up on (expensive, small, and crappy); Taco Bell (NEVER); Arby's (weird, fake roast beef); Subway (genera-sandwich); & a few others. Long and the short of it is this... This food was just plain lousy, tasteless, grotesque, cold, and supremely awful! Had some chicken-part nuggets dipped in sugar sauces of your choice, an "Angus" burger, and the fries were cold, gritty, and tasteless. I really can't understand how and why people eat "food" at these places? Besides the totally disgusting food, the bill was like 18 bucks for the two of us, there were flies all over, and people were smoking just outside the entrance. I was grossed out for the rest of the evening- So much so, we postponed the camping trip and left the next morning because we were both a little upset to our stomachs. Think I'm exaggerating? Go eat there yourself.

I seldom eat at McDonalds but my grandson prefers them and I like to cater to his likes when he viisits. Last evening was our third trip there and if I can help it it will be the last, It gets dirtier every time we go, the service staff are very unfriendly and many need training, they frequently are out of something or the machine is down, and they often get the order wrong. While this McDonalds is about 5 minutes from my home, I will spend another 15 minutes each way to go to another one in Scottsdale.

REVIEW #4:  1 stars  (928 chars)
It was 11:30am and my wife was out with the girls for lunch and I was craving a nice greasy McDonald's hamburger and fries. This McDonalds was on my way home from a meeting and was the perfect place to fulfill my gastric cravings. ... At the drive through I ordered a quarter pounder with cheese meal. I live about 5 minutes from the McDonalds and my mouth was watering all the way home. Got home and unpacked my goody bag. I took one bite of the hamburger expecting my cravings to be answered. Well...the bun was HARD, the burger DRY and the fries were like dry straw! At least the diet coke was as advertised!  ... I landed up throwing it all in the trash and eating a leftover salad from the fridge.  ... The quality control at that McDonald's is horrible and I will never go back there again and would tell others to do the same for take out. Eat in, you can always go back to the counter and get a freshly made replacement.

Considering this Mickey D's is one of very few choices to stop for food and restrooms on the way to/from Rocky Point, we ended up stopping here twice over the long weekend. ...  ... I'm not a fast food fan, and I'm especially not a huge fan of McDonald's but I do have to say that they make a mean ice cream cone!  I had a coffee on our first stop, which was just fine (although they didn't have my preferred sweetener - the pink one).  On the way back, I went with a classic crispy chicken sandwich and had a few of Jared's fries; both were pretty gross.  For 55 cents though, I had a bag of apple slices, which was a not only a great deal but a healthy option too.   ...  ... Decent bathrooms and a changing station to boot, I was thankful for that (as was baby M).  This is definitely not a destination but a decent road trip stop.  Be prepared though, it gets very busy on holiday weekends!

REVIEW #7:  1 stars  (441 chars)
Absolutely the worst McDonald's anywhere!   Bathroom's trash was overflowing and had no toilet paper.  Most pathetic looking employees ever - everyone looked miserable.   Manager was a total beeoch  when I told her she was giving us the wrong food and stormed off.  Rather than emptying the trash bins a worker used some metal device to smash it down.  Gross!  Food took at least 5 minutes to come out and was mediocre.   Go somewhere else!!

REVIEW #8:  1 stars  (800 chars)
Stopped here to pee and eat breakfast our way to Rocky Point from Phoenix. Being a popular stopping point for those going to Mexico and San Diego you would think they would be suited to handle a plentiful amount of customers.....Nope. Walked in to see the counter lined with at least twenty tickets that hadn't been made and the kitchen staff seemed to move at a glacial pace. We were able to order right away but got stuck waiting 10 minutes before they called our number only to tell us they were out of sausage. Did I mention it was only 7:30? They still had three hours to go! After yet another 10 minutes they finally were substituted two sad looking bacon strips on a biscuit and called my number. It was the driest thing I have ever eaten. Not that I'm expecting much from McDonalds but c'mon!

The first Drive up window is covered with a sunblock screen, I drove by it only to hear knocking from the back of my truck. So I pulled back to pay. Then they forgot straws. Then had to pull back because they gave my 2 year old frys instead of apples. Gila bend is punishment from above!

I really like this McDonald's location. All of the workers, whether it be early morning, late night are really nice. Heck, I'll admit it, I've been through this drive thru a few too many times and most of the workers recognize my face and we'll get chatting (if there are no cars behind me).  ...  ... Why review a McDonald's you ask? Plain and simple, the workers here are phenomenal and shoot, I know I'm a pain when I ask for a 'fresh batch of fries' each time I visit. The fact that they  take the effort to throw some fresh tatters in the frier for me is extra nice!

REVIEW #2:  4 stars  (400 chars)
Not much to say about this place. It is a McDonalds. Though its cleaner than others, and they are usually pretty friendly. I have gone through the drive through and it is always slammed. So just parking and going in might save you a little time. ...  ... If your looking for something for the kids (playhouse), its small and just like a little playhouse.  So go to the one on Guadalupe and Val Vista.

It's McDonalds.  Sometimes I get cravings for McDonald's (I know it's not the best food to eat), but it sure hits the spot! ...  ... I always go through the drive-through and it's not too bad because there are two places to drive through that take orders that funnel into one place to pay and pick up food. ...  ... Three stars because it's not particularly delicious, gourmet food.  But this place does a great job at being McDonald's!

Came home from a family vacation thinking we'll grab some McDonald's for the kids since it was late and had work and preschool the next morning. Turned down Wendy's, In N Out, and Burger King for the kids. Big Mistake. ...  ... Service was bad and the food was cold.  ...  ... My advice: find another McDonald's if you must have it or go some place else before you go to this place. Plain terrible. Gave me the wrong burger and it was cold. The fries were also cold. They must be trying to see if they can be the worst fast food restaurant in the area. They are number 1 in terrible.

I'm really irritated because when I ordered my lunch today the girl that took my order  clearly wasn't listening to me and charged me way less than what I owed. The soda I ordered was flat and syrupy and the manager was very rude to me. ...  ... From now I'll be going to to my favorite McD's on Val Vista and Guadalupe. At least I have never been told that I can't have refills because the manager thinks I'm sitting outside! ...  ... Maybe if they decide to stop being so rude! ...  ... I don't appreciate the rudeness!

THIS PLACE IS A JOKE!!! Now, I will start by saying that this is McD, so you get what you pay for and shouldn't expect more. HOWEVER, with that being said, I think that this is worst fast food cst service I have ever! This McD is right across the street from our house, and since we were is a hurry, we decided to drive thru. I am actually not  a McD fan, I do like their chicken nuggets, and frequently drive thru for a large Dr. Pepper. Tonight, my husband and I drove thru and ONLY ORDERED: 20 CHICKEN NUGGETS, 2 LARGE DR. PEPPER, & a MEDIUM FRY. That is not a large order, not complicated, or any reason to receive the 'service' we did. We were told to move forward because they were waiting on our chicken nuggets. OK, no problem. PROBLEM: SIX CARS GOT THEIR FOOD AT THE WINDOW BEFORE I SENT MY HUSBAND IN TO GET OUR FOOD! He got it and we drove away, just to find out that we were MISSING OUR FRYS!!! Are you SERIOUS!??!!!! We went back and went in to get it corrected and give the manager a piece of my mind!!! Besides some shallow "i'm sorry's", they gave us our nuggets, and some 'fresh frys' which were no where close to being fresh! I really CAN NOT believe the 'service' we received there, and vow to go out of our way to go to another McD from now on, or pay a bit more & go to our FAVORITE chicken spot, CHICK FIL A!!! Friendly, nice, accurate, and even though it is still a fast food place, they SERVE YOU, come to you table to clear it, and refill your drinks, all with a happy attitude! Oh, and did I mention the FRESH FLOWERS ON EVERY TABLE?!!! Yep, now THAT is cst service that goes above and beyond the call of duty!!! ;) My advice to them: RETRAIN, TEACH CST SERVICE, ESPECIALLY TO THEIR MANAGERS!!!!

I work really close to this McDonald's so I stop in often before work for a drink or snack and it's probably the most consistent place I've been to in regards to service.

They are always friendly at this McDonald's.  My husband loves the Chocolate Chip Frappe and one time they made this incorrectly, but we were already several miles away.  I called them back and said the Frappe didn't taste correct.  We went back and they made another one for us free of charge and we got to keep the one that didn't taste quite as sweet. ...  ... This McDonald's is very inviting, clean, with a large children's play area, TV sets.  Sometimes service inside is a bit slow, but if we go inside, we are not in a hurry.  They usually get our order correct at the drive-thru. ...  ... I just wished they had the Hot n'Spicy McChicken still on the dollar menu, as my husband likes that.

REVIEW #3:  5 stars  (731 chars)
This is the cleanest McDonald's I have ever been to. Plus they have a huge toddler play area with flat screen tv. It was so nice to sit here and enjoy my coffee and newspaper while the kids played. The play area is just like the mall, but without the filth and crowds. There is a hand sanitizing station and a sign that says to use before and after play. The play structures aren't those disgusting tube slides and ball pits that are impossible to clean. These can actually be cleaned! (See pics). I hope this stays my little secret. Free wi-Fi too! Friendly employees. Food is of the same quality you'd find at your typical McDonald's. I just thought the decor, atmosphere, cleaniness and play area were good enough to Yelp about.

What is the deal with the double drive-thru?  This McDonald's is always busy, so I guess the two lanes help break up traffic for like a second, but here's what ends up happening..  There are two lanes to place orders, but then they merge to one lane for the pay window and pick up window.  So you choose a lane, place your order, and then as you inch up toward the pay window, the guy in the other order lane speeds up to try to get in front of you to get his food first... well guess what, buddy, I ordered first, so my food is going to be ready first!  It's so annoying!

Horrible service here, Sat in the 2nd drive through while 5 cars placed their order in drive through number one. Someone behind me got our and walked the window to complain.  Got my child's happy meal with no chicken nuggets, just fries and Apple's.  Forgot to give me straws and had to remind them 2 times for the milk.  When I went back to complain and just return my food and get my refund one manager pushed me of to another and then he argued with me that I did have the chicken. Don't like McDonald's anyway and hardly ever go there, this just sealed the deal for me.  Good luck with the rebranding of Ronald, with service like this it won't matter.

This MC is on my way to work. In the mornings I usually go and get some coffee to wake me up. I ordered one of their mcafe things and an apple pie. The coffee was great and with some creamer it tasted damn good.  ...  ... The apple pie was awesome and reminded me of how much I loved  the warm apple pies my mom was preparing me when I was a little kid. Even though it was really hot when I got it, that first bite tasted like heaven.  ...  ... Mixed with the coffee and considering how inexpensive the meal was itself I must say my breakfast was so good.  ...  ... I know it is not the healthiest of choices but sometimes I like to throw health out the window when it comes to being happy and eating things that just taste really really good. I'll probably get breakfast there more often now especially since I don't really like eating breakfast at home.

If I could give a 0 for this McDonald's I would.  This seriously is the WORST, I mean very WORST fast food place ever.  They hire really lame employees and do not properly stock their supplies. ...  ... We've been here a few times and we know how McDonald's food tastes, not real great, but this one is way subpar.  I remember one time and this was over a year ago, we ordered a bunch of stuff for a family of four.  They told us they didn't have everything cook and had us pull around and wait.  We were in the drive-thru.  So, we did. ...  ... Nearly 1/2 hr goes by.  We see people enter the place and leave the place with food, but still ours wasn't done.  I finally went in and asked about it.  They said, oh, sorry.  We got the food and when I went back to the car to check, the food was fricken' cold. ...  ... Are you serious?  I went back in and asked for a refund, which they didn't want to give me a refund, but finally they did.  We left the place really hungry, no food, and very aggravated. ...  ... Several times, this was the closest McDonald's and we needed ice.  I tell you, 100% of the time, they were always out of bags of ice.  Really?  I've actually never been to a McDonald's where they ran out of ice.  If you don't sell, ice, then why advertise for it? ...  ... We honestly thought maybe they were having an off day, but there have been maybe a couple other times where we got the food and it tasted like it had been sitting for hours under some heat lamp.  Ugggh.   ...  ... So, though this McDonald's is the closest to where we live, if we need ice or some fast food, we make sure never to go to this one again.  The people are beyond unintelligent and totally lack customer service. ...  ... Whomever is the owner for this franchise needs to do a better job of selecting their people and seeing that they provide good customer service and follow good protocols as the rest of the McDonald's.   ...  ... At this point, it's a joke between my husband and I about this McDonald's and I don't even know how they stay in business.  They definitely are not following McDonald's standards for how to run a business.

You have to pull around for a cheeseburger and a coke, and there coffee machine is always getting cleaned at 6:00-7:00am. Hey dumbass, people like coffee in the Morning! Go to the one on Power and Ray. They are dialed in up there.

Their ice cream machine seems like it's always down, don't go there if you are expecting a hot filet-o-fish sandwich.

I am so happy that a previous reviewer mentioned Ralph by name, because I didn't know his name but he is inspiring this review. Please keep in mind that I only go to mcdonalds a) in the morning and b) through the drive-through. The food is consistent because that's what McD does. This store doesn't mess up my order as frequently as others have. It's quick. And Ralph. Ralph is always there at the drive through, he takes your money. He is so kind that it's confusing, and he has on more than one occasion told us "Good job!" handing back our debit card. I don't know wtf we did a good job about but it's probably the first and only time you will hear that in your workday. Thanks Ralph, good job too.

REVIEW #4:  4 stars  (347 chars)
It's a McDonalds, being consistently McDonalds.  If you've ever been to McD's, you know that they all taste exactly the same (I mean that in a good way). ...  ... I would have given it 3 stars but there's this really nice lady at the window that I see all the time and she always asks how my day is. ...  ... I like that lady.  Four stars for you.

I have been to better fast food joints. They have a TV in the main part of the resturaunt and its always on ESPN!!! Blech!!  Who wants to watch sports all the time! ...  ... The salads are never fresh! The lettuce is frozen and the tomatoes are sometimes rotten. The other thing is there are some very disruptive kids and teens who come in and talk really loud and sometimes use obscene words and leave the tables they sat at a mess. The kids think that this some kind of a free hang out joint the management either doesnt notice or doesnt care! I come here all the time for quiet and I get it sometimes but then there are the time that the outdated 50's music is too loud and kids are screaming and yelling in the playplace. Tables are not cleaned consistently and the trash is sometimes overflowing. I really liked this McDonalds but since the owners and management dont seem to care about customers I can only say that I will be finding somewhere else to go to eat, relax and use my laptop (free wi fi). The free wi fi is about the only good thing about this Mickey D's besides the nice guy at the drive thru named Ralph. ...  ... I'll check out Starbucks and see what they have to offer by way of peace, quiet, and wi fi!  Sheez!  What an embarassment! (in the words of Chef Gordon Ramsay)

REVIEW #6:  2 stars  (176 chars)
Regularly mess up your order.  Far too often ask you to pull around and forget to bring out food. One good note: Ralph in drive thru is the nicest senior citizen I've ever met!

REVIEW #7:  2 stars  (529 chars)
Today I came here like usual to use the free WiFi and get a large drink. I always sit in the area by the restrooms and the TV because there is an outlet there. The TV seems to be stuck on a channel selling jewelry! I like this McDonald's I guess but it could be modernized a bit. It needs updating a lot! In the ladies room there is currently only one stall open. the other one is locked there is no handle on the door. Imagine that! ... I think I''ll wait awhile before I come back here because maybe by then it will be updated!

REVIEW #8:  1 stars  (1499 chars)
During the day this place is acceptable, just to be served by a great guy named Ralph. He is a very cool senior with such a big heart. ...  ... The reason for the one star is that the service is so bad. If you are in a hurry go to the drive thru, that is where they focus their attention and pretty much ignore the guests in the lobby. However, you will get your food fast, just accept the fact that your order might be wrong. ...  ... This McDonald's is very close to our house and we sometimes stop in late night to get ice cream from the drive through. The service at night is beyond bad. They always have a difficult time giving back the correct change, the orders are wrong.  ...  ... The one thing that really stands out is the way they shove your food order at you in the drive through. We like the ice cream cones, you would think that if I am in the drive thru in my truck and I order ice cream, that you might want to take a little bit of care in making the cone. Like clock work, they start handing me ice cream cones ( shoving at me is more like it) the cones are dripping and the ice cream is falling off the cone. I really don't want melted ice cream spilled all over, I asked for a napkin, the girl replied "there is paper around the cone"  ...  ... For some reason, I keep thinking the service will be better at night, it never is. ...  ... If you want some late night entertainment, go though the drive thru at night. You must bring your sense of humor,Don't say, I didn't warn you.

REVIEW #9:  1 stars  (770 chars)
I think this McD's is OK, but I think it could be updated a little. The TV in the main dining area is always on ESPN.  They need self serve drinks, they need a better, cleaner newer play place. I would bring my niece and nephew here, the playground is never clean and its always too noisy! Plus bigger kids come in and play (13-17 yrs. old) and I know that the little kids always clear out of the play ground because they are so scared. ...  ... I like the WiFi and I like to come here,  but I just think it could be a little more modern you know and maybe they could turn the music down a bit!  ...  ... I also think they should ask those annoying teenagers that use bad language and don't buy anything to leave and stop messing up the tables and leaving them that way.

REVIEW #10:  1 stars  (997 chars)
I was here last night(9-2-12) with my neice and nephew, they in the play place and were watching a movie. My neice was playin the play place tubes and some stupid big guy shook the tubes by holding on to part of the play equipment thet sticks out. He shook it for about 5 minutes or so. I was calling my neice to see where she was, she didnt anwer so I sent my nephew up to find her, he couldnt find her. Finally she came down and told me that when the play place was being shaken and she hit her head and became dizzy. I was not feeling good and I had to keep an eye out for my nephew so without thinking I did not report it to the manager. (I should have I know) ...  ... Just a warning to all unsuspecting parents and caregivers who come to a play place expecting a safe place to play, beware of idiots who do stupid things like shake the play place equipment! ...  ... I hope that the owners and manager read this because something needs to be done ... to keep the children who play here safe!

REVIEW #11:  1 stars  (460 chars)
I was sitting quietly using my laptop when two men came in a asked me if i owned a white SUV outside in the parking lot. A lady came out of the playplace and started out the door the men started yelling at the lady i dont know why. The men threatened to call the police and the lady in front of her kids used very obscene words loudly, such rudeness! ...  ... I think that those people should have escorted out of the place and the police shouldve been called.

REVIEW #12:  1 stars  (461 chars)
The manager of this establishment has in inability to handle complaints, maintenance issues regarding the coffee machine, and counting money correctly. This is the 4th time I have had issues with my coffee order, 1st time: they just forgot to make it; 2nd time made incorrectly: 3rd time the wrong drink was made all together.... And this time: no coffee added to the order. The same manager handled the situation each time not in a timely manner whats so ever.

REVIEW #13:  1 stars  (210 chars)

REVIEW #14:  1 stars  (740 chars)
Today I ordered a large vanilla cone and paid for it the person at the counter  said "That'll be right up for you." Well it wasn't right up and I waited for 20 minutes before they finally got around to making it for me. Another time a couple years ago i ordered an ice cream cone and the boy who was working behind the counter made the cone and set it on top the ice cream machine and let it melt. when I asked why my cone was sitting there melting he said very rudely, " oh i forgot i made it. here you go." he said and handed me the cone. "I don't want the melted cone!" I said. I was furious and even more so when I had to argue with him that he owed me a new, fresh cone. What an embarassment! C'mon McDonalds, get your stuff together!!

Eggs were not dry or over cooked.  ... Biscuit was fresh.  ... Sausage juicy.  ... Hotcakes fluffy. ... Hash browns - I wouldn't know because I didn't get them!!

REVIEW #5:  1 stars  (535 chars)
Came to the drive thru placed my order which took over 4 minutes to get correctly (so I thought correctly) because he wasn't listening. Then driving all the way home over 10 minutes to find out you can't even get the order correctly. & you refuse to fix the issue you caused.  Then you bring out your "head" manager and continue to argue with the customer. I thought the customer was always right , especially since this was YOUR fault. You don't listen, you rush me out the drive thru. Yeah let's just say this IS THE WORST MCDONALDS.

Only come here if your really hungry and out of options. Took over ten minutes to get my food and sent back the fries as they were room temp. Should have sent back the burger too but I was hungry at this point. Counted  five people behind the counter and two people in front of me. Horrible.

This is one of my go-to McDonald's locations.  I'm a regular to this particular McDonald's; enough for me to be recognized by most of the staff and several of the managers.  It's got a clean interior, good prices, and, for the most part, a friendly staff.   ... I'm not a big fan of most of the food that the McDonald's franchise sells but I go to McDonald's often for their coffee and blended beverages. ... There are times when someone will get your order wrong or ring you up incorrectly, but they are very quick to resolve any issues.

REVIEW #3:  1 stars  (575 chars)
Bad store. Absolutely awful drive through. I live not too far from this location and have come to it for food over the years. Each time, over quite some time, I've been horribly disappointed by the drive-up service - today was no exception.  The food is McD's, what more need be said except that this time the burger tasted old and the fries were stale. Its one thing to wait 15 minutes when there are only two cars ahead of you and another to get crappy food once you finally get to the window.  ...  ... I've been here enough times to say with confidence: Avoid this place.

Dirty restaurant! ...  ... When I walked in I was struck by how dirty the restaurant was. The floors looked like they never get mopped plus litter on them. Behind the counter the stainless needed cleaning, especially where the sundae toppings were. Most tables had trash on them. ...  ... I complained to the manager, a young dark haired girl who said she would get to it. Yeah, right... ...  ... Most of the customers 1 saw that day were using the drive thru so they would be unaware of the dirty restaurant. ...  ... I will not be back. There are plenty of other McDonalds that at least appear clean.

REVIEW #2:  3 stars  (519 chars)
This is the McDonald's located just inside the newly remodeled Wal-Mart on 59th ave. & Bell.  Review is for breakfast experiences only.  Service was prompt and polite, and I didn't have to explain over and over that I wanted no bacon, or have a cashier that could not figure out how to order an "egg and cheese biscuit".  Food came up fast, tasted the usual McDonald's way, and then I was off to fight the other Wal-Mart patrons (at least the lady in front of me extinguished her mini-cigar before going into Wal-mart).

REVIEW #3:  1 stars  (1331 chars)
Let me start by saying I am not one to complain because I've worked in fast food before but this is ridiculous.. Hate this McDonalds. Staff is rude. And service is horrible. I went through the drive thru getting my Neice and nephew food after school and I paid the guy in cash and some change and was a dollar short so I have him my card and I got my food and got home then I got home checking my bank account to see that I got charged for the whole meal on my card and then my niece told me her sandwich wasn't there.. So I got angry not only double charged but didn't get the food. So I went back and told the manager RION (that's his name) what happened and I was friendly at first but after waiting 15 minutes for him to count the register money to see if they were over tells me they are only 8 dollars over and I could take that or nothing.. I told him I was charged 12 extra on my card after already paying in cash. And I asked for the guy who was helping me before to come up to clear the confusion and the fucking manager tells me that he's working and they would slow business down if they brought him up. First of all, the business already sucks!! If he's charging everyone double and not giving the right food. So if you must go to McDonald's then go to any other one but this.. Horrible horrible horrible people there.

REVIEW #2:  4 stars  (654 chars)
This McDonald's obviously isn't getting 4 stars because of its food, because based on food alone, McDonald's is a 3 star at best and I get that. ...  ... This McDonald's is a 4 star because of their employees and overall service. Even when they get busy, they have rarely messed up my order. The one time I recall them getting my order wrong, they were quick to fix it, and did not even try to give me any grief about how it was some how my fault. ...  ... The inside, bathroom, and even the kids play area are cleaner then the majority of other McDonald's I have been to. ...  ... Who ever is running this place and doing the hiring is doing a good job.

REVIEW #3:  3 stars  (749 chars)
3 stars for the restaurant itself, quality is on par with where it should be and service is okay. ...  ... HOWEVER. ...  ... Do not, under any circumstance, go to the drive through. Absolutely every single time, my order was catastrophically wrong. I don't mean, oh they forgot the extra pickles, bummer. I mean, ordered two big macs, a snack wrap, large fry, and two mcdoubles, got two big macs, a grilled chicken sandwich, two mcnuggets, no fries, one quarter pounder....you get the point. ...  ... As if that wasn't bad enough they put the big mac together wrong. No, you read that right. They couldn't assemble a big mac. I literally mean, bun, condiments, patty, condiments, patty, and then middle bun, and bottom bun. How do you screw that up?

REVIEW #4:  3 stars  (405 chars)
Mango Pineapple Smoothies - like crack... without the nasty side effects!! ...  ... Drive-through is slower than most, and they tend to forget things like straws in bags. I hate drinking straight from the cup! The food is just like any other McDonald's ... isn't that the point?? ...  ... The kids play place at this one really sucks... like bad... like a cardboard box would be more fun. So don't bother.

The food is McDonalds quality, you either like it or you don't, but I like that they are fast & hire very nice young people (OMG! Only old people say that, so I must be getting up there, lol). I'm giving them 4 stars because it's always a pleasant experience to go through their drive through :)  ...  ... I do have to add that their speaker was on the fritz & I did let them know. Still, it's not like I wasn't going to drive another few feet & talk to someone in person. At 5 am when I'm prepping for my long drive East, this is really not a big deal, lol.  ...  ...

It is close to home, I love going during the week because the food and service. The service on the weekends is very slow. One night my husband and I went and it was not yet closing hours and as we drove up to the drive in they shut off the lights at the drive in and at the windows. They mix up our orders a WHOLE lot and it seems like we cannot get quality fries they are either old or cold.

The curb-appeal was impressive and the dual drive through was appreciated. I placed my order, "Diet Coke please" and when the kind drive-through attendance asked if I wanted to add an egg white McMuffin I gladly obliged.  ...  ... The drive through was quick and friendly.

When we placed her order I was going to get my usual iced mocha coffee but then Erica started interrogating us about who was with me and she asked if I had two seniors with me. She then asked me if I had ID. Seriously lady you are carding me for freaking 69 cent coffee??? I will not be returning to McDonalds after this.

If this is the location inside the Wal-Mart, I would rather crawl across broken glass and then dive into a pool of rubbing alcohol, than eat at this location again. The managers are terrible on a good day. The employees couldn't care less about their job. The fries taste like they've been fried, frozen and then re-fried. They are horrible. EVERY TIME I GO THERE. Last time I went (my husband actually went...I was just standing there in silent protest), the manager and employees were taking pictures of each other with their cell phones. My husband stood there at the register for quite a bit while they finished screwing around, then the cashier (whose name I don't know because none of them wear name tags) reluctantly came over to help. I got the feeling he was annoyed that we interrupted him and his buddies... The husband got his food and before we made it out of the parking lot (thankfully), we realized the order was wrong and the fries were stale. Again. I so hate this location. Now I insist we go across the parking lot to the stand-alone one.

This address is for the one next to Panda Express, not the one in Walmart. ...  ... This place sucks and it doesnt even come close to any other McDonalds. How in the world can you have so many employees working and have a line of people waiting for their food? It's like there is retarded people working there and they all have special needs. This one guys was just waiting for a happy meal and had been waiting for 10 minutes before I even got there. It them about 15 minutes for them to give me my food. One mexican kid that was working was to busy flirting with this girl in front of everyone, while her father was asking why the food was taking so long to make.  ...  ... The dining area was dirty after I got my food and sat down. They should fire the manager and everyone that works there. They take no pride in working there and its sad to see this. It shouldnt matter what they are being paid to be there, its still a job and they ARE being paid to be there.  ...  ... I will NOT be returning to this place.......

Out on errands today, I stopped into this McDonald's just for a snack.  The service was fast & friendly, the dining room clean, comfortable and very nicely decorated.  I loved my treat too...  just a delicious, large size soft ice cream cone for $1.19. ...  ... "So if it was so great, where's the 5th Star?" you ask.  WELL, I'm glad you asked that!     :-) ...  ... They had air blowers only in the bathroom, no paper towels, and an exit door that opens IN.  That leaves you trying to get toilet paper or maybe an ass gasket to get out of there with your hands still clean unless you luck out & someone else opens the door just at the right time, which happened for me.  In any case, this is NOT OK!  What good does it do for them to tell employees to wash their hands & wear gloves if they're going to ignore this important health issue?  Minus one Star.     :-)

I went through the drive thru to buy my daughter and I some lunch. She had gotten a kid happy meal with apple juice and I had gotten a snack rap with a drink. The cashier who took my payment was friendly and fun and took my payment quickly. Now the woman at the second window where I got my food. Talk about not friendly and kinda rude. She didn't say one word to me not even hi. She handed me my food and then immediately shut the window. Now I know they are busy but still where is the hospitality? She even forgot my daughters apple juice and I had to waive down the lady to get her juice.

This location literally is down the street from me and I used to frequent it all the time when I still believed I could inject/inhale pure fat + NOT work out and never gain any weight.  Needless to say, I haven't been to this location for the longest time until a few weeks ago to pick up some for my brother.  It hasn't changed.   ...  ... Same old disrespectful, careless tards working the drive thru.  When I pull up to the window to get my food, the person handing me my food just stares at me.  Not a "hello", not a "thank you", not a "have a nice day" ......I'm not expecting you to CARE but part of the etiquette of working in food service is to not look like your best friend just died and least say hello to the customer.   ...  ... One time I asked for a large Dr. pepper and I was handed a small one.  So I told the girl working the window that she gave me the wrong size, in which she proceeded to snatch the drink from me without  an apology or any type of acknowledgement and then yelled very loudly and nastily at someone (while the drive thru window was open) "YOU DIDN'T TELL ME SHE WANTED A LARGE?"  Then pops back out the window and asks me "You wanted a large drink?"   YES MOTHAFUCKA.  That's what I just told you!  Ugh wthhhh.  I wouldn't be surprised if she spat in my drink.   ...  ... My most recent trip?  I know I'm Asian but I'm told all the time and know for a fact that I have ZERO asian accent  - SO please tell me why when I placed my order, the person inside acted like I barked out the equation for a hyperbole? ...  ... They have hoodrats working in this joint.  These people should quit and sell drugs instead.

Yep I work in the ghetto...although this shopping center and the surrounding area is new it's still the ghetto... This place has to be the slowest "fast food" place ever!! Ordered the breakfast with hot cakes...the hot cakes were rubbery and of course they forgot to put the condiments in the bag... Well you know what they say..the screw you in the drive through... This place sucks and a shame there aren't any others down the street to go to.

I moved to this area in 2003 and have been coming here ever since. There have been some times that the crew wasn't at their sharpest, and one period of about a year when there was a language barrier (I always had to check before I drove off to see if my Diet Coke was really a Dr. Pepper), but overall, it's been very good. And ALWAYS very, very clean, which is what I *really* want in a restaurant.  ...  ... The food is typical McDonalds. I've never had a cold or stale sandwich or fries, and whenever there's something wrong, it's always fixed quickly.  ...  ... Now, as for "quickly" .. please consider that people can only move and food can only cook so fast. I usually go during breakfast & lunch, and while it's very busy, they usually have a full kitchen. There are only one or two cashiers, but if you pile up too many orders, there's more of a chance to get it wrong.  ...  ... Saturdays are CRAZY busy, I try not to go then! Sometimes I really, really need a Filet 'O Fish, but I know what it'll be like, so I'm not surprised if I'm waiting forever.  ...  ... And Shane M ... is it really fair to rate this one McDs so low when you get sick at ALL of them? I've noticed that on other restaurants I've reviewed, too; food allergies are a real problem these days, perhaps it's not "karma".  ...  ... Anyway, if you like McDonald's, it's a good one, but busy. They do great birthday parties, and the people are very nice. If you don't like McDonald's, there's an awesome KFC right there!

I took my children in one morning because they wanted to visit their play-land.  They do have a awesome play- land for kids. I was disappointed when I had ordered some chicken nuggets during breakfast hours for my kids and their manager refused to make them.  I have worked for this company in the past and their policy is to make fried products all day.  When I questioned it the manager said " It's not our policy".  She had no name tag on of course, but was a heavy older women that was just plain rude.  This is a corporate store, there are several other McDonald's in the area that are more friendly.

I absolutely HATE this McDonalds. It has the most incompetent, slow employees EVER! Almost every time I go there to get a $1 soda, and iced coffee, or something to eat with my kids, it is an agonizing process whether in the drive thru or in the restaurant. I try to avoid this location even though it is 2 blocks from my house. This location has been this way for at least 2 years.....no hope for it changing any time soon...

I moved to the area a year ago.  I've been to this McDonalds drive up a few times.  Maybe it's just bad luck, but these guys have never got the order right and half the time I have to park and wait.  Can't even call the management to complain, no answer.  I have an answer for them.  You're out of chances. I will drive out of my way to find another McDonalds that has their act together.

Ordered two small smoothies and a vanilla latte. She asked me, "hot or iced?" and I said, "iced - no, HOT." After waiting almost ten minutes, I finally saw them set two smoothies and an iced latte on the counter. Telling the guy behind the counter that it was supposed to be hot just got me a skeptical look and a request to see my receipt. So they had rung it up wrong - and after another wait, I finally got my hot latte. Which was anything but hot. It was cooler than tap water. So I took it back and asked for another. That one wasn't as "hot" as the first one. "Can you nuke it?" "No." "Are they always this lukewarm?" "Yes." Asked for my money back.

i have no idea why this McDonalds can "NEVER" get your order correct.  We have come here probably 4 times thru the drive thru, not one single time have I came home with my correct order.   You would think I would learn to check it before driving home.  Truly amazing how the person on drive thru had to get my simple order 2 times over the speaker, and once again at the first window.....and yet, wrong.   I didn't think that 2 cheeseburgers with no pickles, and a 6 piece mcnugget was crazy to think they could get it right

We stopped here on our way to Cali, went thru drive-thru, service was good we did receive what we ordered, BUT the fries were cold!! Chicken nuggets had been sitting out for a bit nothing seemed to be fresh...I know it's fast food but does it have to be cold food too?

We are a household full of workers and college students so we do get a good feel for the fast food restaurants in Maricopa. Its not good for us and its probably not our only options but its the easiest. I Dont normally have an issue with costumer service but the drive thru is usually different. They can be rude and degrading. The main problem I had though happened the last time I went there. The guy in the first window took my order roludly kept asking "is that all" and became annoyed when I kept ordering. I was making an order for over five people in my house that evening and when I pulled up he made rude comments about my weight. Yes I am very over weight and jot happy about it. But for him to take my order for five people and accuse me of ordering it all for myself is just hurtful and uncalled for. When I made a complaint the gentleman informed me of his name. When I contacted management for make a formal complaint and the manager kept smiling and laughing while my mother (who had to go down because I was very embarrassed) explained the situation. As the person who was insulted I wasn't put to get him fired but I felt action needed to be taken. The manager informed my mom that he was sent home for the week. But after finding out that he had made several rude comments to other customers she felt further action needed to be taken. The manager could only smile and say that he isn't the usual manager and he has no power. The actual manager attempted to contact us once and said if we wanted it resolved would call him back. Very incorporate situation that should have never occurred.

I eat McDonald's probably 1-2 times a year, but sometimes you just crave a double quarter pounder with cheese. Ya know? This one is across the street from my part-time, so it's usually a waited-way-too-long-to-eat-lunch-now-I'm-starving-and-I-want-food-right-meow trip.

I can't say I'm a huge fan of McDonald's in general. But this location is literally right across the street... so sometimes when I'm feeling lazy, I'll grab some grub there. ...  ... Normally I'd give McDonalds 2 stars, but today when I stopped by here with the boyfriend... we waited. And waited. The boyfriend decided to go up to the counter to inquire about our order and not only did they apologize multiple times, but they gave us free large fries and 2 free apple pies. ...  ...

After working in this area for a long time coming to this McDonalds used to be kind of scary. You didn't want to venture to the doors because of the bums that hung around outside begging for food or money.  ...  ... But today as I am sitting here I can honestly say WOW they did an amazing job on the remodel. They even took away the outdoor section where the bums used to be. The manager is walking around asking how everyone is and that's a great thing! Give this McDonald's another shot guys!

I'm guilty of eating at this place a time or two before but this time it was lucky enough to be full from lunch & meeting a colleague to handle business. Families-it's got a playground for ya. It's always looked a little rundown (to me) so I can only assume that's why they're doing a renovation. No drive thru for the time being so if your in a hurry skip to the next one. There is access tho on the north side so if this is your jam good luck on parking. I'm sure I'll post another review after the renovation is complete. Food wise.....well it's McDonalds, eat at your own risk, hahahaha

REVIEW #5:  3 stars  (1090 chars)
Ok, Ed's gonna get after me 'cause I went to a McDonalds.  But I was thirsty from dinner and wanted to try the Holiday Mint McFlurry.  It wasn't as good as I'd hoped.  It was just their basic vanilla soft serve with a dash of mint flavoring and some red and green chocolate chips mixed in enough to be bit sized.  It wasn't creamy.  It was too thick to drink.  And it was really chewy.  I wish I'd left the Filipino restaurant in time to make it to Ritas Custard instead.  Then at least I'd have the creamy goodness of Frozen Custard.  ...  ...  I have to say the young man who served me was excellent, though.  I didn't get his name and it wasn't on the receipt, unless "KS#3" was him.  He greeted me nicely as I walked in, answered my questions, took my order, made my drink, acknowledged the customers waiting behind me, and even checked with me twice while I was sitting if I was happy with the drink.  Pretty good service for a $2 drink.  I think this kid will go far.  He's the reason I'm giving the place three stars instead of two. ...  ... Overall everything was pretty clean, too.

This McDonalds is one of the worst I have ever been to. There are always transients outside begging for money. Many of them approach you at your car or follow you out of the building. The food is decent but the line is always long. The staff has little common sense. They refuse to give you a drink cup after you have paid and make you wait until your food is ready. This is especially inconvenient because of the terrible drink station layout with no where to put your food. Also don't bother asking for a free cup of water. They give you a cup which is smaller than what you get in a kids meal. Avoid this McDonald's at every opportunity!

Yeah, yeah, I know, two McDonalds in one week??  There's something wrong with this picture.  But this one wasn't my fault.  My daughter was interviewing a potential child care person and they met there.  She had asked me to come along and give a second opinion.  Which was a thumbs down.   ...  ... One reason for picking McDonalds was because of the play area so my two year old grandson would have something to do since he was coming, too.  Oh, and guess who had to climb up the indoor slide to talk him down when he went too high, lost sight of me, got scared, and started crying.  TWICE.  You got it.  But he loved it and I got my exercise in for the evening chasing him all over the place and keeping him out of the kitchen.  His favorite place to head for in restaurants these days.  And I got a mint hot chocolate.  Fancy name is Mocha Mint or something. ...  ... Oh, and firsties on reviewing the place.

I've been to this location several times and have never had an especially bad experience.

REVIEW #4:  2 stars  (919 chars)
This is my first time back to this location after multiple bad experiences.  I have spoken with a member of the upper management team and I feel that he really doesn't care that I'm complaining about his service.  I have been told by this individual that since he doesn't see it, he doesn't believe it actually happens, or that the employee in question is having an off day.  She seems to have a lot of them.  He also doesn't believe in the reviews that are being posted on sites such as Yelp, foursquare or other social media sites.  It's view as a way for complainers to complain, yet I see a lot of positive reviews. ...  ... The fact that they close down an access point on Saturday nights due the car show and then again on Sunday evenings for their deliveries, makes getting into the parking lot a bit of a hassle, but that is what it is. ...  ... So I don't go hear as often as I once did, but that is my choice.

I typically visit this McDonald's and am a regular due to the Playland, my daughter and the Arizona heat. As of late, they have been completely lacking in the Customer Service end. My latest visit left me quite displeased. I waited 15 mins for my order and when it finally was ready, my frys were  missing. After pointing out the issue, I had to wait an additional 5 minutes. I got over it, big deal. But then my daughter asks me for an icecream cone so I go to order. As I approach the register another patron enters and is behind me. When this happens the manager and employee completely overlook me standing there placing my order and service the patron after me. At this point I am shocked and appauled. I decide to express my frustration to the assistant manager who offer me a very lackluster apology. Avoid this place if you can help it.

I usually don't give fast food restaurants over 3 stars, but this place deserve an extra star because they filled up my strawberry milkshake all the way to the top, not 80% full like other place does with the excuse of "oh, we did this by the weight".  You filled it up because people paid money for it.  If you are giving it out for free, then maybe you can use that stupid excuse.  Props for their fast service too.

I rarely go to McDonald's but I needed quarters for laundry so I stopped in this one, located inside the Riverview Center Wal-Mart, and ordered something I've had a few times before, a small Ranch Chicken Wrap, formerly $1.49, currently $1.89.  I was impressed it tasted very fresh for being fast food and the chicken piece inside it was the real deal, not some reformed "meat".  The worker was very nice about giving me change from a five in quarters, about $3 worth.  So I had a nice little snack for cheap and got the change I needed.  No complaints here.

Pretty fast in the mornings, don't go after noon. Even in the morning you can get sloppy and not always fresh product. This bothers me because I don't expect much out of a place like McDs but to not even be able to put hot burgers out is just sad. I stopped today to get a coke. Had to go in because their drive line was too backed up... At 1230p....

Crappy customer service and management that was there when incident occurred didn't seem approachable. Went online and did survey and requested someone get in touch with me about the situation...that was a week ago and still nothing. Had gone through the drive thru and got a lady who rudely said yeeeeeeeah.. When I asked, ma'am are you ready for my order? And she continued to ask after I ordered each item (in a cocky manner) if that "was it". I understand it's fast food, but for crying out loud, some BASIC mannerisms and customer service would come in handy. Wish I could rate this a negative star!

This place is a joke!  Went through the drive thru at 9:00 for a soda and ice cream cone and was told the ice cream machine was already turned off.  Was offered a cup of ice cream from the freezer.  Kind of takes the whole "soft" out of soft served ice cream. ...  ... I have have no faith in local franchise owners caring much about anything other than the money they make, I contacted the corporate office so hopefully they'll do something about this situation.

Probably one of the nicer McDonald's you'll visit. Newly remodeled, so you don't get that scuzzy feeling that's typical of the run-down locations. No ball pit for the kids...instead, hi-tech games. Solid 4 stars.

REVIEW #2:  3 stars  (808 chars)
McDs is a classic and with an extensive menu that includes a healthier fare, it makes it easier to go back time and time again. ... A huge plus that McDonald's offers is free WiFi. One doesn't even have to be a customer to pop in an use it and this feature makes for good public relations. ... Thanks McDs. ... HOWEVER, with all that's good, there is the down side and that's the kids' area. Filled with video games and interactive movies, kids are running and screaming through this area, still indoors, and dragging chairs everywhere they go. Oh if only the chairs had plastic feet, but they are gone, so one has to endure the metal against tile time and time again. ... So if you are serious about getting anything done on your laptop, go right next door to Chick-fil-A, where things are a little quieter.

Someone needs to move the trash bins somewhere away from the drive thru I could smell cheese already. ...  ... It's relatively inexpensive food.

It's one of the few places in the area that is open late. Staff is the best I have ever seen at any McDonald's in my  ... Life.....and I've traveled the country!  ...  ... One morning I ordered only a large water, expecting to pay 50 cents or something, and they gave it to me for free, large and filled with ice. In Arizona, you learn to appreciate that...

REVIEW #2:  3 stars  (1446 chars)
I'm about a twice a year McDonalds guy.  I'll occasionally stop for coffee or an ice cream cone at the drive through but I rarely go inside.  The first Mickey D's urge of the year hit us this weekend and we decided to have lunch. ...  ... I've been in this McDonalds a couple of times.  Honestly, it's one of the nicer ones around, probably anywhere. Very nice tables, nice stone flooring, great color scheme, you get the message.  My one complaint every time I'm here is that the drink/condiment area is an absolute disaster! Complete disgusting mess!  They do a pretty good job of keeping the tables bussed and clean but always forget about the condiment area.  The ketchup dispenser is either out of ketchup or such a mess that you don't want to use it and the little cups for the ketchup are either out or you have to dig them out of the holder with a tweezer.  One last request, any chance you could offer sweet and low for the ice tea? (It's the pink packet) ...  ... I had the new grilled chicken bacon clubhouse sandwich. Honestly, it was terrific!  For once it actually looked exactly like the picture and was put together with some pride of ownership.  It was delicious! The fries were hot and fantastic which is good because they have a half life of about 19 seconds so I scarfed them as fast as I could. ...  ... The counter staff was nice and we got our food relatively quickly, overall, a nice place to have a quick fast food lunch.

REVIEW #4:  1 stars  (571 chars)
Came in at 6 am. Drove through the drive through first to even see if they were open. They were! I went inside and they said I was drunk and to get out, refused me service and were very rude. I had not been drinking, I am 19 years of age and was heading to work at Target with my uniform on. The manager with the tattoos on her arms said she would call the police if I ever came back because I was "crazy stupid for going through a drive through and deciding to come inside". I hope this place falls through just because of this incident. I called corp and let them know.

REVIEW #5:  1 stars  (1274 chars)
My son's request for his birthday was "Old McDonald's"  so since my wife refuses I sucked it up and came here Saturday.  I am not a fan of McDonald's or a fan of what it represents, I have respect for Ray Krock but that is about it and I am not sure he would be proud of what he serves today either.  I hope the franchisee doesn't hate me for this review but since McDonald's targets kids with its toys (I know I used to love to go to this place too as a kid) then it gives me no choice but to speak the truth because I am a loyal Yelper that has kids.  My children of course ordered chicken nugget happy meals so they can get the stupid toy.  I made them get the apples and apple juice.  I had not been here in so many years that I noticed an Angus burger that was now on the menu and looked good in the picture.  Of course it was dry and bland, the fries here are always good but I have since learned that they are not exactly 100% potato so there you go.  I pretty much felt like crap when I left but I wanted to not keep my kids always wondering about this place with the desire to go inside.  Next time if he makes the request I will buy a slice of pizza from Barro's across the way and just eat that while my kids eat here.  Sorry McD's your food doesn't do it for me.

REVIEW #6:  1 stars  (405 chars)
Only 2 things bring me to McDonald's, the coffee and.cheap desert. I do give credit for McDonald's on how they operate like a machine. They get you in and out, but unfortunately not this one. 10 minutes for a cup of coffee? Only 4 tables in the place and every single table got up to complain about their food quality, missing food etc. Where's management? Obviously they didnt graduates from hamburger u.

I LOVE this McDonalds! Awesome service, friendly smiles & great tasting food. I alter every order I make here (b/c I'm picky) and it's ALWAYS correct, I never have to send it back or go in from the drive thru b/c it's wrong.  ...  ...

REVIEW #2:  2 stars  (305 chars)
I'd give this place 3 stars but the drive through line was about 12 cars deep, so we went inside.  It took 10 minutes to get our food after ordering.  Coulda been a bad night or a bad time (9:30pm) but this isn't the first time the lines have been really long here.   ...  ... Food is normal, wait is not.

REVIEW #3:  2 stars  (467 chars)
Right now to give this place two stars right now I will check back later, it extremely busy and they're filled with teenagers because McDonald's here is between two schools so lots of noxious loud teenagers in the afternoon on some mornings the weekend has a little bit better but the accuracy if you order is really bad I'll try it again later possibly but never too much problem in the drive-through seems to be very fast and a lot more accurate than on the inside.

REVIEW #2:  4 stars  (484 chars)
I recommend this McDonald's over the Jack-in-the-Box nearby (see my review). Service here is consistent with the occasional hiccup associated with fast food places (e.g., wrong burger or no sauce). Occasionally you get someone working the window who fails to greet you and seems to be in a bit of a trance. However, the service is generally good and you are "in and out" (drive-thru or inside) in little to no time.  ...  ... All-in-all: Good place to eat with generally good service.

Horrible. Worst McDonald's ever. I don't understand how the "machines" can always be broken. I stop for a hot chocolate, but no the machine is broken. I stop for a smoothie, but no the machine is broken. I stop for a cookie, but no the machine is broken. I stop for a sundae, but no the machine is broken. I wonder if the machines are really always broken or if these people are just idiots. Officially done with this place.

I always enjoyed this place prior to its remodel. The staff was always nice,Now I must say its the worst McDonald's EVER! They never seen to get my order right, food is always cold and never fresh. For all who want to complain I finally was able to get a correct phone number. (602-404-9785) Spoke to the so called manager Mariciela, while I was explaining the situation she was not even paying attention just giggling while I was speaking. Didn't seem to even care. NEVER AGAIN WILL I GO HERE FOR ANYTHING, EVEN IF ITS FREE. Just wish I could give a negative stars.

REVIEW #8:  1 stars  (321 chars)
Stay away at all costs. The last couple of trips thru the drive thru, everytume the order has been wrong. Of course you dont find this out till you get home. Diet Coke given instead of regular coke(which was ordered) and they are very stingy with the fries. Always 1/2 filled. Drive up to Burger King right up the street.

REVIEW #9:  1 stars  (724 chars)
This has to be the worst McDonalds I've been to in 20 years... and I've eaten at many bad Micky D's. ...  ... Food is always cold and old.  Orders are correct about 50% of the time.  Employees are always rude.  Such a shame.  I've just moved to the neighborhood and unfortunately this is "my McDonalds". ...  ... But it's not completely hopeless.  My previous McDonalds in Fort Lauderdale was a poorly managed franchise too.  A couple of complaints to corporate headquarters fixed that place in a jiffy!  Don't bother calling the franchise, look for the corporate complaint number on your bag and call.  Franchisees HATE when you call corporate headquarters and they will be forced to improve or risk losing their franchise.

REVIEW #10:  1 stars  (430 chars)
Worst McDonald's ever. It's not the fact that they can never seem to get my order right, but trying to get it corrected is more hassle than its worth. Food is usually cold anyway. But it's  their management that's the worst. They treat you like the idiot, when it's their fault to begin with. If you call the posted customer service number, don't bother it's a recording and still have not received a callback. Avoid at all costs.

As far as fast food, this place won all the stars. We didn't use the restroom, so I do not know how nice or clean they are, but we were in a hurry and this place fit the bill. ...  ... It looks pretty new an neat, I kind of liked the decor. ...  ... Our cashier Cathy was super nice and friendly, we used a coupon from the Entertainment Book and it was a breeze. ...  ... I took a few steps and it felt like our food was ready within seconds... We had found a nice table and we eat really fast, overall I estimate we spent like 10 minutes there and our order and food must have taken like 2 minutes -see my review about JIB, by Cave Creek and Beardsley : ( ...  ... Also, I admire people that are attentive to their customer's needs, while we were getting our drinks, I overheard another cashier (Sofia I think) ask a group of customers if they wanted an extra chair, and think she went and got them one from a table nearby... I thought that was really nice. ...  ... Also, when I got my coffee the lady that gave it to me made sure I got the cream and sugar I needed (I had a bad experience with this on the McDonalds at Cave Creek and Beardsley once, where they ask you when you place the order and we left just for me to find out my coffee had no cream, no sugar : ( ...  ...

Does not seem to be an issue here.

I love this location.  Everyone is really nice.  And the speed of the service is amazing.  You may be the 7th car in the drive-thru, but you will place your order, pay, and receive your food in 5 minutes.  Same goes for when you're inside.  There is limited seated inside, but there's usually not a long line and you get helped and served right away.  Right now I live within walking distance, but if I moved further away and there was another McDonald's that was closer to me, I would still go out of my way to go to this one.

Okay, the 5 stars is for one thing and one thing only. My diet coke first thing in the morning.

This is the best Mcdonalds I have ever been to.  I have never been inside of it, but in the mornings they always have me in and out of the drive thru in under 5 minutes on my way to work.  Often with 6-8 cars in front of me.  Very efficient.

Fast, easy, good parking, friendly service.

For fast food, list location is pretty nice. They get you in and out pretty quickly and I've never had a problem with the food. It also feels cleaner than most fast food restaurants I've been to. Maybe because it's a fairly newer location. My son would give it five stars because he loves their happy meals. I like their grilled chicken wraps a lot and their coffee is also very good. When I'm craving iced tea you can't beat their $1 pricing. Overall I'm a fan! As good as fast food can get!

I call it "The Fast Lane".  The kids who work the drive thru here always get it right, are incredibly fast, and unfailingly courteous - without overdone spiels or orchestrated upsells. This is the best of the new (technology, efficiency) combined with the best of the old (steady, hardworking kids, unburdened by consultants  keen on turning them into obnoxious 'sales associates'.) ...  ... Understated, bedrock service.  Kudos to the mgr. Your guys and gals do a terrific job.

Majority of the time this location is a grade 'A' location, EXCEPT the managers in the morning. Last night my hot carmel mocha was made incorrectly, can't even tell you what it was, but it was cold and disgusting. This has only happened once before and the manager on duty was good at giving the money back to me the next morning when I get off of work. Especially last night 06/21/22 around 915 PM who ever was the supervisor (sorry forgot your name) but you were an absolute sweetheart! You upfront said "My name is _____ and I'm the manager on duty and I take full responsibility"...something so simple like that and understanding without just quickly saying "Oh okay...well we can get you another one" you went over and beyond, but that one statement caught my ear the most! Thank you and keep up the great work sir. I came back to get the refund for the coffee and the "manager" on duty was so careless. I simply let her know "The manager from last night told me to bring back the coffee I ordered last night to get a refund since I was unable to drink this coffee since it was cold and nasty" Her simple response was a quick "Oh ok. Here." - not a "Oh, I'm sorry about that" or nothing. She simply did a promo for a coffee and walked away, whipped her nose with her hand, walked over towards the hash browns and coughed with her mouth wide open, but didn't cover her mouth. I find stuff like that incredibly discussing and if that McDonald's wasn't full of customer's eating I would've called her out on how disgusting she was, sucks for the people who ate from there today...don't be surprised if you get sick. After that nasty mess I stated "So what's going on? You entered another drink, I stated I need a refund"...and her response was "You want a free coffee and and refund" - excuse me? First off - the coffee wasn't free secondly if you were to listen the first time, I stated I was told by the manager from last night to come back for a refund, but instead of being disrespectful and have a slick mouth like her, as I'm so well at doing, simply told her "NO, I said a refund...I don't need a coffee anymore, I worked my shift last night". She's lucky she didn't have her name tag on, another violation to dress code, because I definitely would've put it in this review. ANYWAYS - besides my bad experience today, DURING THE AFTERNOON / EVENING this location is pretty good at doing the right thing, but the few times I've been here in the morning for anything as simple as a drink, to a combo, something is always wrong or someone always rolled off the wrong side of the bed

REVIEW #12:  2 stars  (319 chars)
I do love the quick service and delicious food.  McNuggets are my guilty pleasure.  Today, I went and ordered a large iced tea unsweetened at the drive thru.  Another bonus is the $1 drink.  However, the tea was not fresh.  It was gross and I threw it away.  Shame on you for not keeping fresh tea on hand on a hot day!

I went to this restaurant, located in Scottsdale, thinking that it would be a big deal. Well, I hadn't seen the little "$" sign earlier and arrived there discovering that the raving is on point.  The fries were great. The burgers churned out by the dozen with amazing consistency.  I guess the owners name is Ronald and he's an odd looking fellow...maybe European as he looked a little eccentric to be American.  I'll definitely be back and hope to meet the owner and chef.

I'm a social worker who visits homes in central Phoenix and this is my go to McDonald's when I need a cheap coffee or if I need to use the bathroom. This is the cleanest/safest McDonald's in the area and I never hesitate to stay here to do work if I'm feeling too cheap to hit up Starbucks. I've encountered the occasional weirdo, but I don't feel too bad when a non-weirdo is sitting on the other side of me. There are also TVs that usually play CNN or FOX (not sure).

Ok, I'm not gonna lie.  I feel a bit silly reviewing a McDonalds, but you have to give credit where it's due.  The five stars goes to the morning crew.  There have been many mornings where i have been hungry on the way to work, so i succumb to the temptation of the golden arches. ... I used to be intimidated if there are four or five cars in line.  Not at this place.  And not only are they SUPER fast, it's ALWAYS fresh and delicious.  I'll often pick up egg and cheese mcmuffins for some of my coworkers and we all agree.  They must have magic elves in the kitchen because these are the best mcmuffins e.v.e.r.   ... I also think they must have some sort of mind control device that causes your time to speed up while their time slows down, because on more than one occasion, I've barely had to stop my car because there they are, window open, beverage and bag in hand, smile and "have a nice day" on their lips.   ... The pm crew leaves a bit to to be desired, but the morning crew has me at hello.

Occasionally I just feel like going out for just basic breakfast, i come to this particular MacDonald's.  It's a place to have a big breakfast and watch some of the interesting people that you now are regulars among others. It's always clean and the service pretty quick. it's by no means and exciting venue!   is okay for what it is.  I am not a big breakfast eater so it serves the purpose when I am in that particular mood. ...  ... When I am traveling I often go to a MacDonald's for breakfast.  I usually need to eat something and can count on pretty standard fare and a decent price.  If it's just before catching a plane in the morning, a Greek meal that I might prefer first thing in the morning might not set well at takeoff as a big breakfast..

I come here when my fiance who is pregnant craves french fries after having extreme food aversion to anything we try to eat at home. Usually it is pretty quick even though there are lines in the drive-thru as usual. ...  ... I decided to Yelp this place today though because it is either extreme coincidence or racism that occurs each time I go. I honestly don't care either way, but I think it is interesting to report.. ...  ... I am a Caucasian adult male, and I commonly have African American adult males ringing me up or handing me the GIANT bag for the one order of french fries. Every single time so far they avoid looking at me, don't ask me if I need anything or any questions, and beyond that they literally do not say a WORD. Even when I say 'thank you' before I leave it is ignored. ...  ... Today though, which is also why I wanted to write a review, FOR THE FIRST TIME, I was asked if I wanted ketchup, and my fiance didn't want any, but I was glad that someone thought about how they never give you anything, not even salt, on the side, and wanted to make sure the order was okay. The funniest joke about this was that he was an older Caucasian adult male. He even responded when I said 'thank you'. That is what made the difference of treatment stand out to me. I always assume fast food workers won't say a word, but this particular experience painted a weird picture over the different visits. ...  ... I wish I would have asked his name. I think people deserve credit for doing things like that, it is exhausting to have to keep that energy with every customer all day.

Worst McD's in the world wide Franchise!!! I live down the road and they consistently serve old, soggy fries!  The workers consistently sound irritable and commonly get your order wrong.  I usually would not waste my time reviewing a McD's but after 10+ visits to this McD's I am thoroughly dissatisfied.  Do your self a favor and drive down the road to the next McD.  Especially if you want hot, fresh, crispy McDonald's Fries!

You forget how lucky you are until you try other places.  ...  ... This MCD went through a Renovation a couple years ago and still looks brand new inside. They have the coolest decor, it is all Americana.  ...  ... The service is usually quick and I cannot recall a recent time where something was screwed up. Seriously That deserves 5 stars now-a days.  ...  ... No play land... yeah!  ... Double drive through ... Yeah!  ... Coffee thing with all the special stuff.... Yeah!  ...  ... oh and the occasional crack head... viewing pleasure i guess.

This is the McDonald's inside Wal-Mart. Yes, there is also a McDonald's at 1851 W Bell Road (SE Corner of 19th ave and Bell. ... They offer free wifi, whereas the other does not. The wifi works almost throughout Wal-Mart.  ... I usually only get a drink. One gluttonous night, I did try to get a pie, but since it was late, they were out. :( By late I mean between 10-11pm. ... Otherwise though, it's really convenient especially if you have kids that you had to take with to the store and they're hungry, or you just want some Mickey D's yourself. ... I'm not a huge fan of McDonald's in general, but there is nothing atrocious about this location.

**Be sure to check your order before you leave this McDonald's. It's always missing some food item.** ...  ... This has happened to me 6 different times over the past 4 months. Why didn't I learn my lesson after the first time? It's not something you normally think about when you're in the drive thru, that "Oh yeah this is the one that ALWAYS leaves something out!" Plus, I've had other family members go get my order and forgot to warn them. It won't happen again because I'll never go back or send anyone else there. ...  ... When I call the manager , he's always apologetic and says he'll replace the missing item but that's always a big inconvenience. Who wants to drive all the way back? ...  ... The only reason I gave it two stars is because it's the only McDonald's up in North Phoenix that has the game pieces throughout the entire Monopoly Game season. Other McDonald's run out the first few days or the first week. I guess this is the only McDonald's that doesn't let employees pilfer the pieces.

This is the worst McDonald's ever!!! Customer Service is horrible. My boyfriend and I ordered a caramel sundae and the guy forgot to ring it up, he didn't give is us our receipt so we didn't know!! The lady at the window got mad when we asked for a copy of our receipt and was like fuck then slammed the window. So the guy who took our order named Miguel came and was like uhm I'mma need $2.17 super rude! First off the sundae's are $1 we only wanted a copy of the receipt bc there was a long line behind us. Then he was like fuck you guys get the fuck out of here. My bf was so pissed off but I told him to just go. So he drives stick and had to change his gear so the MANAGER on duty comes and was like bitch don't ever come back here we will refuse your service fuck you, get the fuck off the lot. My boyfriend of course yelled fuck you as we pulled off and this stupid unprofessional moron screamed fuck you cunts while flipping us off!!! All bc we wanted a copy of our receipt because the dumb ass didn't give it to us!!! This McD will NEVER get another penny from me or any of my friends!!!! Rudest people and service in my life!!! I only had to give 1 star to post

It's McDonald's.  What do you really expect. I work nearby so it's convenient when I run out of leftovers to bring for lunch. They never messed up my order and it seems well organized. The only time I really had a bit of a wait in the drive-thru was when the person in front of me paid entirely with change. And that's not McDonald's fault.  I only gave 4 stars because let's face it, it's gross fast food. It'll get you by in a jam, but eating here on the regular is not something I can recommend.

Stopped in the drive through after DBacks Fan Fest to grab a light bite and a drink on the way home. Got a Buffalo Spicy McChicken Sandwich and a large Coke Zero from the Dollar Menu and got in and out rather fast.  ...  ... Newly remodeled, this location looks much better than it did before. The ONLY drawback I had was trying to get back out onto the street to catch the freeway, as traffic from Fan Fest was impossible, but someone was kind enough to let me out. That was cool by me.

REVIEW #3:  4 stars  (554 chars)
This perennialy 1-2 Star neighborhood McDonald's recently underwent a complete remodeling, so I stopped in for lunch today to see if they're doing better.  It's nice inside with lots of booths (Yay booths!), and has a completely different floor plan than before. ...  ... I went with a Quarter Pounder Habaero Bacon Ranch Cheeseburger, medium Fries & a small Chocolate Shake ($7.78).  Everything was right with both the food & the restaurant this time & it was excellent for the money.     :-)) ...  ... Now about those 610+380+570=1460 calories!     :-O

REVIEW #4:  2 stars  (836 chars)
Well, it's been 8 months since I gave this McDonalds a try & they got 1 Star, partly for the blowers only in the bathroom, with no paper towels & even no ass gaskets to dry your hands on & pull the door open with to get out. ...  ... Today, the above situation is still the same, & although there is a button to push for handicapped people that is supposed to open the door, it is still broken too! ...  ... The dining room was clean & comfortable, & I ordered an Angus Bacon & Cheese Burger Combo, upgrading the drink to a medium chocolate shake.  The burger was quite good after I added some ketchup to moisten it up.  The fries tasted as if they had been sitting out for a long time, & the shake was rather runny & only ok in taste. ...  ... #13 Angus Bacon & Cheese Combo w/medium shake $7.49 ...  ... This place is no Smashburger!!

REVIEW #5:  1 stars  (1257 chars)
Here's how it is at this Mc Donald's: ...  ... You want to wash your hands before you eat, so you go in the rest room & do so.  Then, there is no paper towel dispenser, only those blowers, so you push the button with your elbow & then wipe your hands on your clothes when it stops.  Never mind that, you say, I'll dry my hands with a handful of ass gaskets...  Nope.  They don't have those in public bathrooms in Arizona!  (ALL public restaurants in other states have them!)  Now the door only opens IN to get out of the rest room, & it certainly has more germs on the handle than your hands had when you came in, so now what?  No problem.  There's a button for the handicapped to push to make the door open, so you push IT with your germy elbow that you used to start the blower.  Woe, nothing happens, because the button doesn't work.  Fine, you get some toilet paper to open the door with.  Nope.  It's run out.  Fine, you decide to use the side of your left hand & try not to forget & let it come in contact with anything while you're eating.  Then when you get home, after washing your hands & your elbow, you use both hands to raise hell right here about this piece-of-crap Mc Donald's.    :-O ...  ... We deserve better than this, even at Mc Donalds!

REVIEW #7:  1 stars  (1543 chars)
Stopped by the drive through to get lunch for me and the hubby.  ...  ... First off, the girl on the speaker was super hard to understand. Not because of the speaker, but because of her accent. If you're going to put someone on drive through orders, make sure the people in line can decipher what they're saying. ...  ... Second, this place has two drive through lanes. Everyone knows it's supposed to go one lane at a time for ordering. The lane next to me had three cars go through before my order even got taken.  ...  ... Third, my order got punched in wrong. When I got to the window to pay, the girl read off my order AS SHE SWIPED MY CARD. So basically I'm stuck with whatever they want to give me at that point. I ordered a nugget combo meal and a chicken club combo meal. When I told the girl the sandwich was wrong (they had a quarter pounder on there), she called back to someone to have it corrected and told me they would give it to me at the next window. ...  ... I get to the window and the guy there is basically throwing my food and drinks at me. I asked him if there was a chicken sandwich in the bag and he said yes. Lesson learned - always check the bag. I open it up and find a quarter pounder with bacon - no cheese. Definitely NOT what I ordered. Not to mention that each of my drinks had three (yes, three) cups attached to each other. Maybe if the guy hadn't been throwing my food at me he would have taken the time to only give me one cup. That ought to throw their drink count off tonight. ...  ... Will not be back.

As far as a McDonald's this close to a Wal-Mart goes. I was actually kind of impressed with how well kept it was. Comparatively speaking... ...  ... I had some time to kill before an appointment so I sat down with my laptop and had a coffee. There were tables with power outlets available specifically for customer use and the free wifi was nice. ...  ... This is McDonald's we're talking about here. They get 4 stars because my expectations were very low and they actually managed to impress me quite a bit during my short visit.

REVIEW #2:  2 stars  (903 chars)
I goto McD's twice a year. Shamrock shake and McRib. This year I added a 3rd trip during the BOGO offer for the new Quarter Pounders. ...  ... Drive thru here offers two lanes to order that converge into one for pickup. Drivers beware. Many drivers leaving the DriveThru also U-turn into the parking area on the East side, so it's probably not a great place to park - and you take your life into your hands if you are trying to leave the Wal-mart via that passageway. ...  ... We found the new habanero QP to be fairly tasty, with a giant slice of tomato and the sauce was actually decent, with some spice to it. Not hot, but hotter than I expected from McD. I was gonna give them 3 stars for the fact that I was pleasantly sursprised. ...  ... Then, I remembered that my previous trip here they didn't have shamrock shakes. They were out. Like 3 days into the limited time promotion. Back to two stars.

REVIEW #3:  2 stars  (613 chars)
Mcdonalds is obviously the most generic hamburger place. It is also the most succesfull despite being one of the worst. Outside of the beloved french fries, what does good ole Mcds have going for it? Carls Jr beat their $1 drink with one for 69 cents. The new wings are horrible. Yes they are bigger then the kind you get elsewhere, but not the right kind of spicy and too expensive. The "special sauce" always brings down the burgers which arent that good to begin with. Now that Mcdonalds is planning on eliminating the dollar menu and replacing it with a $5 menu, maybe its time to try the Sonic up the street.

REVIEW #4:  2 stars  (588 chars)
This is the McDonald's on the corner of 19th ave and Bell Rd.  ... Even remodeled, it still looks dirty. It has always looked dirty in the 10 years I have driven past it and occasionally gone inside. There are always some sketchy looking characters loitering around too. ...  It's right next to and across from some of the busiest bus stops in town, so it does have the convenience factor. ... The last time I got a Big Mac and fries, it was not fresh. ... I never thought I would say this, but if you want a better McDonald's, just go into Wal-Mart right behind and try their McDonald's.

Okay, I know it's just McDonald's, but I feel this particular location deserves a good review.  ...  ... After moving away from this McDonalds, I realized just how great the service is here. The staff is friendly (all the time) and fast! No waiting at this McDonalds. By the time you pay in the drive-thru, move up to the second window, your food is waiting; fresh and hot! ...  ... The food is just what you would expect from McDonalds. So I'm not going to waste my time critiquing  it.

Hey, I was impressed with "This" McDonalds!! My younger kids like to go here to play! I am NOT a fan of most McDonald franchizes as they have young people working there that are Rude & Lazy and they are NOT clean! ...  ... BUT, This place was Clean! The lady that greeted us when we walked in was very sweet! ... They were out of TP in the bathroom and just put the roll on top of the Handycapped Bar :-(      NOT a fan of that! Then when my daughter went to the bathroom it kept falling on the floor and rolling around the floor, YUCK!!!  NASTY! ...  ... Other than that I would say they did good! But please teach your employees to put the toilet paper "IN" the proper container so we don't get everybody elses germies!!

I know it is a McDonald's. I get it. But as far as a fast food chain goes, this particualr McDonald's has my loyalty.  ...  ... Talk about your fast friendly service. Whether I am ordering just coffee or a couple hash browns for my boy and I on the way into school I know I will be through the drive-thru in 5 minutes tops!

REVIEW #5:  4 stars  (370 chars)
This McDonald's is a nice, fast one. They have the double drive-through lanes to order from, and then the lane turns in to one as you head to the pick-up window. The people there were friendly and efficient.  ...  ... Quick service, and I was on my way in less than 10 minutes, after being in a line of at least 5 cars ahead of me. Now that's what I call lightning fast!

this mcdonald's is always providing quick customer service. staff is friendly. drive-thru has double lanes which also makes it quicker. other than that to be honest i don't like mcdonald's. im simply reviewing the service. which i think is fast and friendly. im not a fan of the food. my kid wanted chicken nuggets.

REVIEW #8:  3 stars  (1530 chars)
Ok, so I've been eating at McDonald's recently.  I swore them off a few years ago when they changed what they cooked their food in, and it was making my stomach churn.  But, as of late, sometimes I need something quick and I swing in here to curb my hunger from time to time. ...  ... Overall, the place is good.  Two drive thru lines, clean location, food is predictable and it still makes my stomach churn.  But, I must say, this place has quite the variety of clientle. ...  ... For example, one time I was reading Dave Mustaine's autobiography.  The young girl behind the counter asked who it was. I started to explain that he formed Megadeth after getting kicked out of Metallica back in the day.  Her eye's glazed over and she had no clue who or what I was referring too.  Does this make me old? No. It just was sad that people don't know this stuff.  *sigh* ...  ... Another time there was a fundraiser for the Middle school I live close to and the teachers were raising money by running the registers.  That was pretty cool.  Other times its quiet in here and there's nothing going on. ...  ... Tonight I went with the Southern Chicken sandwich, and it was tasty.  I also was getting checked out by a sort of cute gangbanger while I ate who had tattoos on his head.  On the way out a lady was punching and kicking a road construction cone on the way into the parking lot. She must have walked from across the street.  Poor cone... ...  ... Anyways, place isn't half bad and I think I'm done eating Micky D's for a while...

I give this McDonald's 5 stars because of how fast and effecient they are. I often come here before work for coffee or a McMuffin and the line can get quite long, but it has never taken longer than few minutes to get through the drive thru. Perhaps it is because they utilize both drive thru windows. Doesn't it seem like most fast food places make you go straight to the second window, making it less efficient?

Ok, I know it's McDonald's and my expectations aren't really that high, but there are 2 things about this McDonald's that really irritate me.   ... 1.  When I order a burger without onions, I expect it to show up without onions.  This doesn't really happen at this McD's. ... 2.  When your dollar menu has an item on it named "sausage mcmuffin" and I order a sausage mcmuffin, I don't want to be asked EVERY time if I want a sausage mcmuffin with egg.  If I had wanted a sausage mcmuffin with egg I would have asked for a sausage mcmuffin with egg, since that is what it is called on your menu!  WHY do you have to ask EVERY time if I want the mcmuffin with egg?  I just don't understand. ...  ... Despite these two very irksome things, the staff overall is above average for a McDonald's.  The regular crew who work there in the morning are always friendly and pleasant (despite the fact that they keep asking me about eggs).  The people are the only reason I still go there.

I really don't like giving such low stars on Yelp, but I also want to give honest feedback to businesses so that they're able to change the less than desireable behavior AND warn my other fellow Yelpers. I've been through the drive-thru at this location 2x now. First time was less than favorable, but I wanted to give them 1 more chance to shine...  ...  ... On Sunday, 1/27/12 at approx 10am, that didn't happen unfortunately. ...  ... Okay, it all starts w/the interaction at the speaker when one orders their goodies, right? Well, even if you can't see the person's face, it is still crucial to be polite/helpful with the customer. Please don't be sarcastic/snarky to me if I ask a simple question about hours of breakfast. ...  ... Second point of interaction - at first window. I was digging for exact change in my purse, but is that any reason to yell at your coworker in the back, "I'm waiting on her - jeez, chill out!" and then to roll your eyes and say to me (customer) "it's like we're an old married couple". Very unprofessional. ...  ... Third point of interaction - delivery of food/drink. This went okay, but I ordered a vanilla iced coffee. What I rec'd was vanilla-flavored milk sans any coffee. Not cool. ...  ... Had to park my car, go inside and explain situation to cashier. Maybe I was extra annoyed because I was a tad hungover and really needed that caffeine boost? Plus, I wasn't showered and in sweats, etc - I really had NO business being in public which is why I did the drive-thru option in the first place!! The Manager seemed surprised at my story and almost didn't "believe me". Really dude? I don't have better things to do than invent and concoct this story?? ...  ... After his thorough examination of the coffee-less beverage, he personally made me a new one. He then gave a nice apology. Perfect - that's all I needed... ...  ... Moral of the story? Just get it right the first time, okay??

REVIEW #9:  2 stars  (396 chars)
Well, it is a McDonald's attached to a gas station so what can you expect.   ...  ... First thing that irritated me with this place... the drive thru.  Sometimes, it is inconveniently closed during peak morning hours.  Why? I don't know.  I'm assuming they are understaffed. ...  ... Second, the bathroom is disgusting and unisex.  I won't let my poor daughter use it even if she is about to pop.

REVIEW #10:  1 stars  (861 chars)
Go to this McDonald's locations drive-thru and order 3 things.... chocolate shake, vanilla cone but in a cup - for my boys and fries.  When I got to the window to get my food nothing was ready... you mean with 3 people in the restaurant your staff can't get this ready? Then I look up and realize there is one person already pulled over waiting for what they ordered which ended up being one of their iced coffees. Manager finally comes out with my shake and the boys ice cream, forgets the fries and a straw.  You are a manager? Really? Are you that out of touch? Did you just bring me a shake and no straw and totally forget my fries.  I guess you just can't fix stupid.  I will NEVER go to this location again. Reading the other reviews this store seems to have an evil twin, one really good at what they do the other they just can't get their crap together.

REVIEW #12:  1 stars  (1450 chars)
This is one of the worst McD's I've been to (unfortunately closest to my house) and it seems like the reason why is management. In the 5 years I've been going here, I've had many incorrect orders, been overcharged several times, had inconsistent or poorly made food/coffee, been treated rudely when trying to get problems corrected. I've had to wait FOREVER because of understaffing (or maybe they're just that bad). A couple times they asked me to pull ahead at the drive-thru and wait for them to bring my food out to me. Both times it was clear that I had been forgotten, I didn't order much at all and watched for 10+ minutes while people behind me drove off with their food and drink. I actually had to call and remind them I was still waiting! The icing on the cake is I just found out they raised the price of the McWrap from $3.99 to $4.99, the only McD's in the area that has done this. So you know what? I'm done with this location. If I absolutely had to have McD's again, it'll be somewhere else. Whoever owns this franchise needs to get a clue. ...  ... One last tip to this location... Try putting an adequate amount of sauce/mayo on stuff so people don't have to order it with extra, which sometimes backfires when you actually get "extra" (better than not enough IMO, but still way too much). Seriously, you want me to come back behind the counter and teach everyone what a "normal" amount of sauce looks like? It's not hard people...

This place was ridiculously slow tonight. I stopped for my yearly crave - the Shamrock Shake. To be honest, I have no idea why I love these, especially since I like REAL ice cream and shakes the old fashion way - but this minty green shakes have me hooked. My son also wanted one, but he wasn't quite sure he would like it so I asked if he could have a small taste of mine before they made his; however, they could not do that. Instead I had to buy my shake, move to the side while the order was rung through the POS and then filled and brought out to me. Once he decided if he liked it or wanted another flavor, we had to place another order and then pay for it.  I asked if I could just pay for a small shake and he would decide the flavor after he tasted my - NOPE. I was highly annoyed. I understand restaurant POS and the need to track inventory, but come on - it's a shake. Not only that ... it took over 10 minutes for 2 shakes and they weren't that busy.  ...  ... Unfortunately, I have been to this location on several times because it is close to the house. I typically don't eat the food, but my son loves McDonalds, so I stop for him. On numerous occasions they have messed up the order (he only eats plain burgers) and the service speed is extremely random, regardless of how busy they are. Sometimes it is awesome, other times it is horribly slow.  ...  ... I really don't like giving businesses a poor rating, but this last visit topped it off, and I had to share. I understand the machines are automated, but they could have rang up the shakes and then manually poored the correct flavor, it isn't rocket science, and it isn't going to through off their inventory!

We were served breakfast at 7 am on July 1st. When we got our orange juices one was noticeably a lighter color and only filled 3/4 of the way. The girl had an attitude (breanna) when we asked to have it swapped out. We also were given a sandwich with cheese when specifically asked for no cheese. When they brought the sandwich back out it was still wrong.

Why oh WHY did I even come back here last Saturday night? Well, self, because you quite frankly had major munchies and needed salty food bc of your vodka consumption. That's why. ...  ... I do, however, regret consuming food at this McD's location - even in my drunken haze. ...  ... My Filet-O-Fish (towards the end) had a long (about 3") white hair in the tartar sauce. I started gagging and spit out the burger and the rest. ...  ... Never again. Never!!!!

Updating my review after several weeks. Appears maybe the managers read these reviews. In the last few weeks this store has improved 2 stars. The eggs in my BBs have been cooked perfectly, Diet Coke tastes better and they have not forgotten anything in all my visits. Added two stars because they have been consistently 5 stars since my last review...but I am still watching.

REVIEW #3:  3 stars  (568 chars)
Big breakfast with hotcakes pretty much a staple for my breakfast when I start work early. It is always hit or miss at this location. No consistency in who is cooking the eggs. Sometimes way over cooked, sometimes just right. I worked at McD's for 2 1/2 years when I was in high school. I learned how to cook eggs properly, so can they. ... Another note, they always seem to forget something in the drive-thru. Utensils, jelly, napkins, syrup...it is ALWAYS something.  ... Another Yelper mentioned the funky tasting Diet Dr. Pepper. I agree.Diet Coke taste funny too.

REVIEW #4:  3 stars  (769 chars)
I basically order an egg biscuit sandwich and a diet Dr. Pepper when I don't have time to prepare breakfast at home. The food tastes great but unless you're in the drive thru you can expect a longer wait. I don't go thru the drive thru because I just spent $73 on gas this morning and I don't need to burn any extra gas while waiting in line. Plus, sometimes the diet Dr. Pepper tastes a little funky unless you let the soda that's been sitting in "the tubes" OVERNIGHT run for awhile before putting your cup under the dispenser. And as of today, I guess they don't give napkins with your to go order when you order inside. ...  ... I suggest this McDonald's gets a little bit more wo(man) power during the morning rush to service the customers in a more timely manner.

REVIEW #5:  2 stars  (925 chars)
Coming to this McDonald's is like a box of chocolates, cause you never know what a your going to get. A smorgasbord of different experiences.  ...  ... Parked for an iced coffee the last visit and then when it came it tasted like they gave up waiting for fresh coffee and brought me what they had left over from the night before...bitter. Two sips and out the window it went (I kept the cup, I did not litter). Seriously...parked for an iced coffee???  Plus they give me my HOT food to wait for a cold drink.  ...  ... Without writing a book, my experience dictates that this location should only be visited during rush hours. The staff seems to lack the mental capacity to understand anything about quality, communication or consistency.  ...  ... Management, I highly recommend you re-train your staff on actual McDonald's corporate procedures and learn the guidelines on what is considered fresh...and how to read a clock.

My first two visits to this place was not good.  (Backround: My first job was working in a McDonald's restaurant in another state, so i know how a good burger should taste like) ...  ...  ...  First week: i order a BLT Crispy chicken sandwich at the driver thru.    I get to the window and the cashier had me pull up to the waiting area due to the fact that it takes a 5 minutes to fry the chicken piece.  So i wait for almost 13 minutes.  I then park my vehicle and i was about to walk in and get my money back when my food finally arrives.   ...    When i get to my work site, i eat my sandwich and the chicken is WAY overcooked.  I called their complaint dept. number listed on the receipt. ...  ...  2nd week: i order a Bacon& cheese Snack wrap. Instead i get the deluxe snack wrap.    ...  ... I called their complaint line twice and i got no response to my complaints.  ...  ...  ... Sometime soon i will try to order from this location again and see if they corrected their flaws ...  ...  This all took place 5 months ago so maybe they have a new manager now that actually knows how to run a restaurant.

Not the best McD's in town. Almost every time I go here, something doesn't go right.  Whether it's a frapp that isn't thoroughly blended (ice chunks in it), or slow service, or someone very incoherent on the drive thru speaker, it seems to always be lacking in consistency and good service as a norm.

REVIEW #8:  1 stars  (247 chars)
Holy cow, worst customer service ever. We ordered two premium wraps through the drive through. Took about 20 mins and we were the only people there. We could here the employees screaming at each other whole making our order. Won't come here again!

I just had to... I'm writing this post mortem (BTW) ...  ... Running late to a Saturday soccer match.  Needed some "fast food."  Although I've seen "Super Size Me," we were in unfamiliar territory.  Typically for me, anything west of 7th street is considered east California.  Guilty, I don't know my way "round the west side." ...  ... This is why I don't like Mc Donalds. ...  ... Ordered the Big Breakfast (plate of shit). ...  ... "Light fluffy scrambled eggs, savory sausage, a flaky buttermilk biscuit, crispy hash browns and three golden brown hotcakes. Could it get any better?" per mc donald's web site.   ...  ... golly f-ing geez, put and adjective in front of anything, and i'll eat it: : savory, flaky, crispy, golden diarrhea dog turd.  Y.U.M.M.Y. ...  ... I got a square egg patty.  swear to jesus.  square (think it was to go to an egg mc muffin) ...  ... pancakes.  and biscuit yummy. ...  ... sausage. greasy.  seriously? okay, i knew it would be greasy. ...  ... had to ask for my hash brown (was forgotten), so the nice lady gave me two.  and then i had a heart attack.  unfortunately, no one working there was smart enough to call 911, so i died. ...  ... lo siento, pero no mexicans working there AT all, so service was SLOW.  Every senior citizen, bless their little old hearts, was in line in front of me.  and.  I SWEAR TO GOD the cashier had to get her phone out to add. ...  ... So I ate my last meal, took a Lipitor, but it was too late.  I died.  No one called 911, since the staff can't read nor add, and the elderly didn't have cell phones.

This is one of the worst McD's around. They are slow service, back up easily, half the time screw up the order and some crew members are pretty rude (considering what their job is to serve). Not to mention they have the open late sign but constantly shut down early at night. Forget the late night ice cream run... Wawawahhhh!

Mm M MMMMMM!!! A 24-hour drive thru serving up my fast food favorites!!! It is conveniently located, and despite the questionable hygiene of the crowd that streams through here, this restaurant is very clean. Another plus is that they have a double drive-thru and extremely efficient and polite employees to go along with it. I never have to wait for my food very long at all!

Hey.  It's McDonalds.  What can I say?  Kind of a seedy crowd hanging out at 8AM but it is what it is.  I got a bit tired of paying $30 to have two eggs and etc. brought up to my room in the Sheraton on 3rd St. so I cut loose one morning, got in the Avis car, and drove down to Third Ave. and had two Egg McMuffins for $5.  Nothing satisfies like an EggMc.  I will admit, my coffee was from Starbucks.  They totally hit the spot.

It's a Mickey D's... what can you say? As far as McDonald's goes, this one is A-Ok! The people watching is priceless, the food is the best hangover cure (or late night drunk snack), and for the amount of shit the employees have to put up with from the local cracked out transients, they somehow manage to smile when taking your order! Keep up the good work!

So I have mixed feeling for this MIcky Ds .. I live downt he street so I go here often if its for a soda ice cream or a regular burger.. I got diffrent times late nights early mornings.. But theres seems to be an inconsistent employee One of the drive thru girls During the night and midnight shift is very nice helpful and talkative Fast! Nows me as a regular now. But on occasions shes not there and I have the worst experince employee who argue with me about only the fires come large but not the drink in my meal?? With a Cigarette on her ear? Really? 1/3 time my order is wrong... If i were manager I would clean out some employees... But at teh same time its just Mcdonalds..

REVIEW #7:  2 stars  (981 chars)
I don't often review McD, but after my experience with their drive-thru, I needed to say something.  I went here during afternoon rush hour on the way home from work.  Not only did I get a regular Dr. Pepper instead of the Diet Coke I ordered, but I realized why the drive thru was going so slow:  The exit line spills out onto southbound 7th Street as it crosses Van Buren.  During rush hour, this is a disaster.  So much traffic comes down 7th Street that you could find yourself waiting to exit the lot for five minutes or more--per car.  It might not take that much time for you, but it's the luck of the draw. ...  ... This is a more or less typical McD, situated in a lousy spot traffic-wise.  I'm not lovin' it.  Even if you get what you order, you'll have to wait forever to get it.  Nothing's fast about the food around 4:30 or 5:00pm if you're hoping to eat on the road.  Better to park, eat inside, and wait for the torrent of cars to die down a bit before heading home.

REVIEW #8:  2 stars  (1088 chars)
Normally I wouldn't review a place like McDonald's since we all know that the food is fried, greasy, and all around bad for you. However, this McDonald's warrants a review because it is a people watching mecca. If you work anywhere in the area, go once...you will thank me. ...  ... You know you are going to a klassy McDonald's establishment when the first thing you see is a sign on the door that says "No large bags and no bedrolls". My co-workers and I have seen such interesting people as a guy with a gun in his waistband eating with his family; a woman in a bikini top talking to herself; and most recently on Saturday night, my co-worker and I saw a guy just released from county jail trying to get a "refill" of soda with a Circle K cup. This location is also quite the popular day laborer pickup spot. ...  ... Service isn't the best, but where is it outstanding when it comes to fast food? My co-workers and I have been to this McDonald's about four times in two years, but it always delivers on seeing "interesting" people. And for that reason, this McDonald's gets two stars.

This McDonalds has been here forever, at the corner of 7th Ave/Van Buren/Grand Ave. I stopped in for lunch today while walking home from an appointment. I figured... I haven't eaten Mickey D's in ages, why not? Plus, I'm walking, and it's a... scenic area. ...  ... I was impressed by the cleanliness, especially given the sad state of most of the customers and employees. I think it's mecca for tattooed gangbangers. ...  ... 2 stars instead of 1 because they have Diet Dr Pepper on tap. Oh yeah. ...  ... I had a double quarter pounder with cheese and fries. The fries were luke warm. The burger tasted institutional - think public school cafeteria.  ...  ... I imagine it might be a really entertaining place to stop by on a weekend evening, what with the hookers and hoes hotels nearby with their $20-something rooms and whatnot.  ...  ... Next time I'm in the 'hoooooood and want fast food, I'm hitting Church's Chicken across the street.

It's near where I work, but I don't think I'm coming back.  The cashier & assistant manager were rude to me.  They didn't have the new Frappe/Mocha machine so they couldn't take my Iced Frappe coupon.  They told me I could have a coffee.  I told them I don't like plain coffee.  I suggested a free McFlurry, but the assistant manager refused saying that the McFlurry was a seperate category.  I told them that I'm probably not coming back & that I came almost every week.  The assistant manager acted like she could care less, which irritated me more.  It's BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE.  Because she wasn't willing to give a free McFlurry, they are going to lose more than $100 of sales from me.  SO STUPID of them!

On my way home from visiting my father at the Hospital! Wife's at work,not in the mood to cook this late in the evening!!! I haven't had my yearly splurge of McRibs!!!! So I stopped off at this location, pretty big place! Walked in, because drive through was pretty busy. Only one person in front of me, it was time for me to order! I order the McRib Sandwich Combo, she asked me if I wanted it large! Well no, but thanks for asking! Then she offered me a second sandwich for only .99 cents!!! Wow, well yes! I love to have my yearly McRib sandwich, It's a great time! This half hour of eating this great icon of a sandwich was amazing! You get that stamped piece of pork, lathered in a authentic BBQ sauce and loaded up with pickles and onions, Yea baby!!!! It's only one time a year, and just once! After that I'm good for another year!! Going back to this location, it was quite nice. Very clean, bilingual, and great service!

Today (7/3/14) was my last and final visit to this McDonald's...I'll drive out of my way to the one on Camelback from now on. My last couple of visit has left me not wanting to return the customer service is horrible, you can barely hear the drive thru attendant, there are long lines and you constantly have to wait for your food. When you finally get your food...the order is wrong or the fries are limp and soggy. I've visited this place for Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner and the midnight snack...and the results are all the time for every 10 visit, I bet I've had 3 good experiences.

I heard the burgers here were good, so I figured I'd check it out.  ...  ... After sitting at my table for well over twenty minutes without a word from my server, I decided to go up to the counter to see what was wrong. The girl at the counter was nice enough and offered to take my order immediately while I was standing there. I appreciated that, but the girl still seemed very rushed and my order was very transactional. ...  ... I ordered the cheeseburger and I was shocked by how small it was. I guess it tasted okay, but overall it was very average and lackluster with a plain bun and a slice of boring American cheese. I felt like I could have gotten a hamburger like this on any other street in any other town.  ...  ... In addition, not once did the girl come around to see if we needed a refill on our drinks. After waiting well over an hour for the girl to offer a dessert or cup of coffee, we just left. Good thing, as I heard the coffee they serve there is so hot that if you pour it all over your lap, you will actually get burned. ...  ... As for ambience, the one thing I did like was the large family portrait on the wall. I was definitely impressed by the fact that there seemed to be an elected official in the family, but then I read that his last name was not McDonald, but instead McCheese and I couldn't help but think that he was not even related and instead only added for fluff. Even more important than that (and please note that I am all for trying to rehabilitate convicts), but if you have a family member who has been through the prison system, please at least put them in some different clothes before you take a family photo. ...  ... I still gave McDonald's five stars because I think it's important to support small businesses, but Mr. McDonald had better clean up his act if he has any true aspirations of making it in this business.

was in this location on 03/04/2013 and the staff did not seem friendly. I came in to eat, the girl who was running the counter was too busy messing with her phone. I ordered and waited for my food. When they called my number they did not even say thank you for coming in. Now I know this is McDonald's but I have been n my share of them and they always say hello. Came back the next morning after I got off work and went through the drive thru. They were happy and thanked me and even stated hope to see me again. I am not sure what is with the night staff verus the day. But I guess I will use drive thru in the morning.

we rarely have McDonalds and made a big mistake by going to this McDonalds when we arrived in Phoenix late night 3/23/2013 .   The staff is rude, they messed up the order and the food was cold.  The order was packed with the fries sideways and falling out and the bread was hard and stale.  The food was so bad we wound up throwing most of it away.    The wanna-be gangsta working the window wasn't happy when we pointed out their mistake.   The owner of this McDonalds should find some people who care a bit about their job...  the 2 people their on 3/23 could care less!

so i went through the drive-thru today, and upon ordering 3 burgers and two with just ketchup and cheese, the "Se hablo espanol" working the mic kept ringing them up as "ketchup/no mustard" and repeated it back like 3 times,  after saying she didn't know how to get the order right because they got a new system (NOT MY PROBLEM!) doesn't give them an excuse to mess up my order! anyway we also ordered a "caramel apple sundae" the muchacha even repeated it back as "caramel apple sundae" then rang it up as a "hot fudge sundae" (not what i ordered!) then upon getting to the window they hand me a hot fudge sundae, after telling them about it, they go and get a caramel apple sundae with maybe an inch of ice cream and light caramel drizzle. at other McDonald's i get about 2-3x as much!!! i guess i wont be going back to this one for a while (at least until the estupido learns the "new system")

REVIEW #2:  2 stars  (588 chars)
Usually this Mcdonald's is not too bad. However, the orders and wait time has gotten pretty bad lately. Tonight, I waited in line at the drive-thru for 10 minutes before I could order.  ... So, I order some apple pie's with my meal and I am told it will take 10 minutes to cook them. Okay, so I order two hot fudge sundaes and I get home and realize they have put some bitter chocolate sauce on the sundaes instead of hot fudge. This has happened before. If someone pays you for a product, why don't you provide it?  My opinion of this McDonald's location is has really taken a dive down.

Don't take your "Gold Card" here it"s not accepted per mgr. We bought the card for $20 to support the kids from a local high school and this McDs refused  it.

McDonalds "Express". I waited about 9 minutes for the person in front of me to get their food. I'm not sure what they ordered but they only got one bag. When I pulled up, there was no apology for the wait. Just "hi, your total is 5.62" or whatever the change was. Food tasted fine, but service and wait times were subpar. I'll drive further for the McDonalds 1 mile in the other direction.

REVIEW #2:  3 stars  (1153 chars)
Generally I don't review fast food places unless the customer service is outstanding or severely lacking. Unfortunately this review falls in the latter category. First the positive. This location is easy to access from the street, has sufficient parking, and the interior was clean although I did not see what state the bathrooms were in. My food was ready quickly and the employee who was calling out order numbers was friendly and ensured I received everything I ordered. ...  ... As for the customer service, my order was taken by a clearly inexperienced manager who walked away from the register no less than 4 times after asking "What can I get for you?" but before I could get a word out. When I finally had her attention again, I ordered my meal and took my receipt and she walked away again before giving me a cup for my drink. I was not impressed with the owners choice in management. ...  ... This location does not have a play area aside from a couple electronic games on the wall. Despite the distracted manager, the food was not below par for what it is and there were no safety or health concerns so I think 3 stars is fair for this visit.

REVIEW #3:  3 stars  (507 chars)
I dropped into this small McDonald's for a bite today & enjoyed it enough that I thought it was a little bit special.  They have comfortable booths, & my friendly counter gal gave me an extra dressing for my salad without charging me for it (as some McDonald's do).  It was also thoughtful of her to offer me a water cup when she saw that I didn't order a drink.  I'll get her name next time. ...  ... I don't have the nerve to give a McDonald's 4 Stars, but it was nice & I'm very likely to return!     :-)

I can't believe I'm reviewing a McDonald's - but it had to happen.  Not just because I'm a freaking fast food junkie so it was going to happen one of these days anyhow - but because of today's experience. ...  ... I've been to this one, well, let's just say more than several times.  The food is always.... uneventful.  It's not one of those specifically great or specifically bad ones.  It's just..... fine?  The only really good thing I got there once was their big breakfast.  It was only McDonald's good, but man it tasted good that day. ...  ... Anyhow, so I was grabbing a breakfast burrito (that stupid healthy yogurt was not going to calm the grumbling monster that was my tummy that morning).  For breakfast, I'll normally either get my item solo, or as the meal w/ OJ.  But I remembered seeing last week that in a blind taste test, the McDonald's coffee actually scored higher on a taste test than Starbucks.  So I figured I'd give it a shot.   ...  ... ACKKKKKKK!!!!!!!!  PLECCCHHHHH!!!  Ick!  Ug!  Gross!  Spit, spit, spit....   I wanted to wipe my tongue down w/ the wood tasting napkin to scrape it all off.   ...  ... They had thrown in some sugar and cream.  I'll normally do a cream and a sugar for one this sized.  I initially tried it black. I thought maybe it was better w/ the stuff added.  This was a SMALL cup, and I added both creamers and all 6 sugars they gave me and I could barely taste any sweetness.  It was like the black hole of coffee condiments.  What is totally sad - I ended up drinking about 1/2-3/4 the cup just trying it after adding each condiment.  I really wanted it to be better.  Kept waiting for that magic ingredient.  It didn't come.   ...  ... Nasty, nasty, nasty.  Mediocre fast food, fine.  But the extra 15 min drive to Starbucks suddenly looks much more reasonable.

REVIEW #5:  2 stars  (624 chars)
I have visited this location on many occasions and have been disappointed one too many times. I'd say that going through the drive-thru has caused me more misery than necessary. I'm sure they've gotten my order wrong a minimum of 75% of the time and today's order included pickle stacked on the top (meaning outside) of the sandwich. Also, while waiting at the drive-thru window one time I even had the employee chat me up a bit during a long wait for food. He had the nerve to complain that McDonald's required that he take a test and that he failed it. (Shocking!) Do yourself a favor and avoid this location at all costs.

REVIEW #6:  2 stars  (688 chars)
Normally I try to stay away from McDonalds because they are everywhere so they are where I go when there is nothing else.  I still end up eating there every year or so with travel.  This time though I was just tired and it was the closest place to eat. ...  ... I went through the drive through and got one of the chicken wraps with fries and a drink.  When I got my bag there was no ketchup!  They didn't even ask if I wanted any.  Despite no ketchup the french fries tasted better than the wrap thing I had. ...  ... I don't normally eat here so I can't comment if the blah taste of my food was typical or not, but it wasn't worth the calories.  Plus I was peeved to be without ketchup.

Traveling through Phoenix, we were just looking for a light, quick bite to eat. We pulled up to one of the twin ordering stations. I thought this was a neat concept until I witnessed the not-well-thought-out merging process. The line from the second station was a straight shot to the pick-up window and the line from the first station had to merge into that line. It was a microcosm of Phoenix freeways at a McDonalds, complete with traffic jams and crazy drivers. ...  ... The food: My McBurger was dry and tasteless; my wife's chicken McNuggets were petrified and they forgot the ranch dipping sauce, which made her realize that the sauce is the only thing that saves them.  ...  ... This location is convenient to the freeway, but next time we are passing through I think we'll just keep going.

I hate two lane drive thru. Unfortunately I live in the area.  Three times now they go out of order and I get stuck waiting for someone to acknowledge my lane.

Go elsewhere like In N Out across the street.

I got food here twice.  I rarely eat fast food but have a soft spot for egg mcmuffins; they don't seem THAT bad for you and are filling.  The first time, the English muffin part of it was just about burnt to a crisp and inedible (leaving me hungry until lunch).  The second time, it was barely toasted and the cheese was cold (giving it a much much much less desirable flavor).  This mixed with kinda rude staff (for those I've dealt with) on both occasions and I'm not going to make the same mistake a third time.

If I could give this location zero stars I would. I am surprised this place is not shut down by food inspectors or McDonalds corp offices.  This is a horrific McDonalds. The food is always bad, cold, cooked, or served wrong, despite the easy order. ( Ice in a drink. REALLY? Ya can't even get that right McDonalds staff worker? )  The equipment is always broken, place is dirty except the parking lot ( More on that in a minute)  the staff do not speak English but work positions where they need to, and never  get the order or change correct.  ...    I had complained several times about the staff member who goes out and waters the parking lot every day. McDonalds corporate offices ( not in the deserts of Az of course)  tell me it is policy to wash the parking lots fully every day. REALLY? Even when it is clean? Really? The whole parking lot in a huge strip mall McDonalds? REALLY? Even when you have 200 cars backed up at drive through? Is this the workers only job? He sits out there on the curb holding a hose. He does not clean the restaurant or the bathroom or help serve the million people backed up on line? Hey I want that job. ( insert sarcasm here) Hey MIKEYD"S you do know we live in the desert right? ...     I used to go here every morning on the way to work for my cafe fix but I stopped last week. I will never go back. Last week the man with the hose was outsIde smoking!( yes a cig, it was lit, and yes he did inhale!)  He was also just aiming the hose in the air letting the water squirt into the air. No, thank you for asking, there were no trees, flowers or plants nearby, just cement. Not a clue what he was doing. Just wasting water in the desert and smoking. SMOKING???????Did I mention he was smoking? EWHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH Oh BTW, did I mention he was smoking????? Smoking around food? Ok, technically there was no food in the parking lot but ya get my drift right? I say OMG! How gross are you McDonalds?

Servers are friendly here and the fries are always fresh and crisp. ...  ... The best thing about this MCD's is Mimi, their 88 year old worker. She always remembers me and others and gives us a grandmotherly hug. I wish I had her spunk and energy. A hard worker and such a sweetheart!  ...  ... 5 stars to Mimi!

I haven't eaten food from McDonald's in years, but I've stopped by this Mickey D's location several times recently for their ice cream cones...  ...  ... $1.64 for two ice cream cones... you can't beat that!  And they are reduced-fat too! ...  ... For those that want something fancier, they also offer McFlurries (the McDonalds version of DQ Blizzards) with toppings such as oreo cookies, M&M's and Rolos, and sundaes with hot fudge, hot caramel, and strawberry.   ...  ... As their slogan goes, "I'm lovin' it!"

The 5 stars I give this place is not for their food, because we all know what McDonalds is.  I go here almost every morning for my iced coffee that I love and adore. ...  ...

Running around I got the munchies and stopped in for a couple of egg McMuffins.  They tasted the same as they have since they were invented in Santa Barbara decades ago.

Granted if you've seen one McDonalds you've pretty much seen 'em all. However when I tried to order a caramel coffee - it's like I was speaking another language. I even explained how to make it and they still got it wrong.  ...  ... They refunded my money and I got a Coke instead.

Great to finally have a McDonald's here at the airport. "Street prices" posted and food is good along with all the drink options. Service is quick and coffee is hot!

REVIEW #3:  4 stars  (1225 chars)
I mostly agree with Javier, but I observed a bit of confusion when it came to queuing orders and delivering service with a smile. For example, order number 384 was ready before order number 362. That is just silliness. Maybe each register has its own sequential numbering system? And the staff all seemed a little blue. Cheer up, you're missing opportunities to smile and bring joy to friendly people! :)    =)   ;) ...  ... The airport in Phoenix is called "Sky Harbor." That conjures a romantic and optimistic notion, doesn't it?! I like to imagine that someday in the future, we will have floating airports that are real sky harbors, in a truer sense of the word. Phoenix will have a tricky one because it's kind of windy up there! Anybody who has landed at the airport knows that. It can get a little bumpy. ...  ... If you are a steampunk person, you might imagine that the sky harbors will be filled with dirigibles! And they will dock and make clanging noises. Maybe a grand elevator will bring goods and people up and down to the sky harbor. Or maybe there will still be an airport under the sky harbor. I haven't really thought it through. ...  ... I was on my way down to Mexico for thanksgiving. It was really fun.

Glad the prices were not the airport gouging norm.  ...  ... Food was expected and came out pretty quick. They get slammed in spurts when planes come in and take off. ...  ... The bad ...  ... We went there 2 different times 9 days apart.  ... 1st time we ordered a 10 piece chicken nugget. They gave us two boxes of 4 pieces. ... The manager apologized and said the guy missed counted. She gave me a 6 piece but it only had 5.  ...  ... Next time  ... I ordered a couple breakfast burritos and hash browns.The clerk asked if I wanted hot or mild salsa, hot please. My wife got a egg mcmuffin and I also got a sausage muffin. ...  They forgot my wifes egg mcmuffin.  So I go back. ... OH there are no hash browns. So I go back ... Great no salsa. They asked me and IT WAS ON THE RECEIPT.  So I go back

REVIEW #3:  2 stars  (1224 chars)
Not sure what is up with this place, but it's been pretty poorly run for years.  Tonight the place was packed, the line for the counter was out the door, and 1 register was open.  Staff were tripping over one another back there, so it didn't appear to be a staffing issue.  The manager was filling fries...oblivious to the line. ...  ... It's like this every time I come in here... ...  ... 3/29  So I just had to add to this post from a few weeks back, because I stopped here the other night on my way home from work.  It's only a mile from the house, otherwise I'd find another one. ...  ... Anyway, I hit the drive through at 9:53PM, and after about a minute of silence I finally got the person working it to realize I was there.  I placed my order, and saw three cars in front of me.   While I was waiting for my food (chicken nuggets and fries) I entertained myself by watching the manager walking around the parking lot.  18 minutes later (yes, 18) I FINALLY got to the window and another couple of minutes later got my food.  For the amount of time this took, I could have killed, plucked, cut up and cooked the chicken myself!  I guess it was too much to hope for that I may actually have a pleasant experience here.

This is me eating my words.  I mocked those who reviewed McDonald's locations and now I myself am doing that exact same thing.  Here's where I will try to redeem myself as a Yelper - I am not reviewing their food as much as I am reviewing the decor. ...  ... I will admit that McDonald's is a guilty pleasure of mine.  There are times their french fries call out to me in the night or I crave McNuggets dipped in sweet & sour sauce.  I may be drooling a bit right now, in fact.  What keeps me from frequenting there as I did in high school is both the knowledge of what goes into fast food and the fear of the oil and grease.  The fryer smell both draws and repulses me and I feel my skin getting greasy just from the proximity.  Nevertheless, if the call is strong enough, I will look beyond all that and get me a McMeal.  Such was the case recently. ...  ... After an evening of wine sampling ("wine tasting" would imply that it was in small quantities, which it was not) my fiance awoke with a mean McCraving.  He is a recently reformed fast-fooder and had gone from frequent visits to the drive-thru to having avoided it for nearly a year.  We decided that if we were going to cave, we might as well check out the recently-leveled-and-rebuilt McDonald's.  Figuring that they were new enough that the fryer, exhaust fans, etc. would still be free of too much buildup, we ventured inside. ...  ... This is seriously the best decorated McDonald's I have ever been to.  It has a mid-century modern feel to it with retro chairs, patches of dark wood flooring and what I can only describe as raised-circle-in-a-square ceramic tiles surrounding the drink/napkin/ketchup area.  I can seriously see some of the design elements being incorporated into a cool modern home.  Flabbergasting is how out-of-place it is in that area of town, where most commercial makeovers seem to involve stucco and tan paint. ...  ... We ate our food in awe of our surroundings.  Was this the future of McDonald's eateries?  Or just a fluke?  I'm hoping it's the former.  If I'm going to stuff myself with fast food, it would be nice to at least do so in a visually-pleasing environment.

What the Heck?!?!?! ...  ... I went in to grab a bite. The store was beginning to get busy and the cashier had a lot of people in line. I ordered and was waiting for my food. I noticed this redhead employee who was wearing a white shirt and black tie. I assumed her to be the manager, what caught my attention was that food was sitting and this women was busy TEXTING on her phone. Why would you text during work?? Then I watched her finish and place the phone in her back pocket. Without walking over to WASH her hands she picked up food bagged it and handed to customers. Then walked back over and started the text message again. REALLY? Not only are you too focused on the texting, but also cross contamination of food. I really do not know how clean you phone is. I am surprised that more people did not notice it. When it got to my food I asked that she wash her hands to pick it up or have someone else.  Beware of this location.

How often is it you see a chain fall so far from the standards for such a long period of time and yet corporate seems to just let them limp along.  It's a new , ok relatively new building but it doesn't look it.  ...  ... Tonight is the second night we've been in a two month period were  no fountain drinks no cafes or drinks other than bottled water, apple juice or milk were around. It's not like we frequent the place but  when someone puts out a habanero burger I feel obligated to support em.  ...  ...  Sadly the burger was the least juicy, scant of dressing one I've encountered so while it hints at getting hot there's not enough  on it to find out.  ...  ... They appear, no let's be bold here and state it , they reheat / refry  their "premium" crispy chicken wrap   it's nasty even before you get to tonight's surprise which is rancid ranch... Yeah a bite and a run to the trash can to hurl it out.. ...  ... As usual  no receipt, no real F's given about the lack of drinks, slow service  in fact  the opposite of the one up at T Bird / I17   If you have to eat  fast  and can go the extra couple of miles it probably will save you time and  result in edible food

REVIEW #8:  1 stars  (371 chars)
If I could this place no stars I would.  Slowest drive thru ever. Literally took 20 minutes to order. Then I was told to pull up and wait some more after I paid. They actually have designated spots for you to wait in which tells me they know how slow they are! This is not what I call fast food. NEVER AGAIN.  Next time I will just drive down the street to BK or Wendy's.

REVIEW #9:  1 stars  (372 chars)
This McDonald's needs some serious help from customer service. The manager melody should not be a manager but in the back peeling potatoes. They continuously get the order wrong and make customers wait 25-30 min for a redo. Go thru it yourself and see what I'm talking about . Melody's body language suggests she is burned out and does not hold the McDonald's core values.

Why am I reviewing a McDonalds? Because I have to tell you about how awesome the employees at this specific location are!  ...  ... I normally go there during lunch or in the morning, they are always courteous and they get the orders out really fast.  ...  ... Recently, on what can only be described as the world telling me to go screw myself, I had locked my car keys in my office, only to realize it when I was at the park and ride in Tempe after taking the 45 minute light rail trip, having to go back to my office, where the alarm was activated which meant no access, to having a dead cell phone and a debit card sitting comfortably at home, I had to walk to a nearby walgreens and purchase an 18 dollar phone charger. The girl at the walgreens said they couldn't plug my phone to an outlet to charge. At this point it is dark outside, and I can't even remember the phone number of anyone that lives in this city to come and pick me up. ...  ... So I am walking alone on central avenue at 7:30 at night and I make it to this mcdonalds, and I ask if they will charge my phone for me and they do! I might as well eat dinner, so i order off the value menu and get my food. While I'm sitting there wondering what in the world I did before smart phones. Talk to strangers that's what.  After a nice conversation with a woman who was eating her dinner before going to work, I was handed a milkshake that had to be remade because the customer asked for no whipped cream, the girl said I should have it because I was having such a bad night. ...  ...  ... So thank you MCDonald's employees, I will visit this location even is its just to buy an iced tea and I will forever be grateful!

CLOSED! This McDonalds has closed. Gone are the days when I used to conveniently walk here from work to pick up a drink on my break or get some coffee in the morning. Apparently the sales at this restaurant were not enough so it moved to a new location in a more centrally located area with easier access for customers. ... Funny thing is I still see people try to go through the drive-tru and park to go into the restaurant.

People who wine and dine at Mcdonald's get a bad rap. Why? Because people who don't dine at Mcdonald's aren't living and are therefore jealous. The truth is only about 20 percent of the population can full unlock the euphoria tunneled away in every bite. We are higher spirits of a different breed than the everyday jealous Mcdonald hater. "Why you hatin" was perhaps invented to suit the likes of these people. For me and my intricate complex neurology, I realize what Mcdonald is was and will always be. That is perfection.

HOW THIS LOCATION SAVED MY WAISTLINE! ...  ... Okay, first let me get this one straight, I like fast food burgers - a lot. But, that day finally came (and it comes to us all) when I thought "Hey these jeans are too tight, I suppose I should put on my fat pants instead" Only to realize "OMG! These ARE my fat pants! aaargh". ...  ... That was it, the moment had finally arrived when in-between sorrowful sniffs the road forked in two directions. My lovely wife asks what's wrong and all I could say was "nothing, sniff, sniff" and when she asked if I'd like to go out to dinner to cheer up I heard the voices on my shoulder talking to me. I had to make a choice. Did I? ...  ... A) Embrace the devil on my left shoulder and go for it whilst casually mentioning that all my clothes were so last season and we should go shopping together tonight too! ... B) Listen to that long forgotten voice on my right shoulder saying "HAR, HAR, You just got reality checked! Now do something about it." ... Well, after another 5 minutes of futilely looking in the closet for clothes that fit, then seriously considering if the credit card could take the beating of a of new wardrobe of clothes I let the top button on my jeans stay open and finally decided that enough was enough, it's time to take the second choice...but I was damned if I was going to give up burgers while doing it. ...  ... So, here's what I did. After a year of eating out too much, and a new baby in the house I knew it would have to be cheap, so I cast aside thoughts of Subway and went to my old Favorite - McDonalds! The very next day I started myself on what I came to call "The McDonalds Dollar Menu Diet". ... I posted it to my Facebook page and at first my friends thought I was kidding until they saw the weight continue to come off, week after week. ...  ... For lunch 4-5 days a week at this location (and a couple of dinners a week) I would have a McDouble, a Side Salad with Paul Newman's low fat Balsamic Vinaigrette or low fat Italian salad dressing and either water or a large Diet Coke or large unsweetened Ice Tea. It cost me just $3.27 per meal including tax! I was filled up, had energy and a balanced diet. If I skipped the drink it was only $2.18 per meal. ...  ... This diet I chose and stuck to has put me from borderline obese back to the lean healthy figure I last had 10 years ago. Thanks McDonalds! ...  ... 30 lbs later I swear that I never want to go back to what I was, but I still eat my "McDonalds Dollar Menu Diet" at least twice a week because it tastes so good. (Actually, I just finished another one for lunch...) ...  ... So, instead of blaming McDonalds for supersizing America I now happily say thanks for the healthy choices!

This location is in a scary neighborhood. ...  ... But, the inside was renovated with McD's new interior design.  So it looks nice and well kept up thus far. ...  ...

I told him to ask his manager and she would correct him, which she did. ...  ... Fries were good.   ...  ... I likely will return to this location, but maybe not at night.

I understand that with fast food you can't be terribly picky, however, tonight they completely dropped the ball.  ...  ... I ordered 2 fish filet meals, large. I received 2 medium drinks and some cheeseburgers. Ok, you'd think it's a simple mix up... No. I had to argue with 2 employees to get my order right. I left somewhat upset only to be even sooner angry. I was 1/4 of the way through my fish filet when I found a black piece of plastic... Safety hazard, I'm sure.  ...  ... I really enjoy McDonald's from time to time, but unfortunately they were unable to keep up their end of the deal - "great" fast food and service.

What can be said about a Mcdonald's? They have recently required all of their franchises to make their prices consistent, so there's no hidden gems selling $1 chicken nuggets or 4 cookies for $1 anymore. The food is usually the same wherever you go. ...  ... The ambience, however, can make a regular visit into a special one. Such is the case with this location. The kids and I stopped in for a quick breakfast visit while my wife was at a meeting nearby. We were immediately drawn to the walls of the restaurant, which were covered with dinosaur posters, figures and facts. The kids were ecstatic! They started looking at all of the dinosaurs and asking their names and pronunciations. We ordered our food and headed toward the play area. What a surprise to see huge dinosaur models flanking a very large play structure! The entire restaurant was painted in a jungle motif, as well, so it gave the impression that you were in a Paleozoic forest. Very cool! We plan to come back soon so the kids can get a chance to crawl around more in the play area. ...  ... Sadly, they have a design board on the front counter showing the elevations of their remodel. They plan to turn it into a bland, faux-upscale Mcdonald's. According to the renderings, the play area, dinosaurs and any hint of a unique experience will be gone. Lame! ...  ... If you want to give your kids something other than a generic fast food experience, head here quick, before the dinosaurs are extinct!

Ok there are to many complaints about the employee's. Do you think most of them want to be working at a minimum wage job? Don't expect them to be too happy all the time... and for the most part they are nice and helpfull. I would like to complain about the customers more so... some of them get to angry for food, like seriously it's just food dont get yourself to worked up. And for the record I would like too say that McDonalds coffee lids are the best invention ever, every other coffee lid, like at Tim Hortons, NEVER stays open!!! I love the LID!!! It's EPIC!

REVIEW #5:  2 stars  (664 chars)
The food is very very fake. When most of the fried products get to room temperature, they melt into a goo rather than just getting soggy. . . Need I say more? Everything has additives, and yes, eating there often will make you fat. It's impossible to avoid with food of that quality. The service is going to depend on who the manager is at the time. If there's someone running the store poorly, people are going to be waiting on food. When people wait on food, they tend to complain... but my problem is its mcdonalds... you get what you pay for. ...  ... I know they add something to the fries to make them addicting, that's why I still frequent this chain store.

The manager was RUDE.  We stopped in on a Sunday morning and had to wait a little while for anyone to come to the register to wait on the customers that were ahead of us.  Another employee started to take my daughters order and the manager made him stop, not sure why, but she did.  She took our order and when it was kind of thrown on the counter for us to pick up, she made it known she was not happy that I asked for a couple of packets of mayo. ...  ... Not sure I'll be back, they don't seem to care about the customers.

This Mcdonald's is no different than any of the other's when it comes to food at least.....and I have only had there ice cream....and mocha drinks. The one unique thing about this place though is it is always PACKED....I mean the drive-thru is ridiculous. I say unique because it is surrounded by all kinds of wonderful places to eat. There is Olive garden.....red lobster......outback steakhouse....In and Out burger....CoCo's.....5 and diner....Island burger......Laparilla Suiza......Barro's......Chick-Fi-La.......Picasso's........IHOP.....and they are even building a new Culver's and all of this in walking distance of this mcdonald's. Yet these people invade this establishment like it is the last Mcdonald's on earth....don't know whether that is good or bad...but for me I will pass. Eat, Drink. and be Merry my Friends!!!

As much as I like the breakfast at McDonald's, I will no longer be going to them. WHY? One reason, their Wi-Fi. It is without a doubt the absolute worst on the planet. Dunkin Donuts and Starbucks are fantastic but McDonald's is very, very, very bad.

Been here a few times, just a normal Mcdonalds, well, was. Pile of rubble as of 07/01/2014. Don't know if they're rebuilding.

Why 4 stars? It's McDonalds, that's why. Its consistent but not great. But we were all raised on this stuff so its hard to hate it.  ...  ... This particular McDonalds is clean and remodeled. Service is on the slower side and one time they totally drove me crazy by not accepting a McDonalds coupon that I got in a Pats Run swag bag.  ...  ... I'm grateful to have it in the neighborhood.

REVIEW #4:  2 stars  (1466 chars)
To say the employees here are rude would be putting it mildly.  ...  ... I come here frequently, not because it is the best McDonald's, but rather because it is the closest McDonald's. The food here is okay at best, for a McDonald's. It's certainly better than either location on Chandler Boulevard. However, my major complaint is that no matter what time of day I come or if I go drive through versus inside, not a single employee thanks me for my business.  ...  ... It especially irks me because as someone who has worked customer service, I always make a point of thanking the people who are providing me the service. I don't think it's unreasonable to expect the same courtesy from people where I choose to spend my money, thus providing them a job. ...  ... Apart from the blatantly rude service, this location seems to have a problem with employees never emptying trash cans. Especially at the drive through. I can't count how many times I've come, even in the morning, and that trashcan is overflowing. I'm not sure if it's a problem for the health department or not, but I can tell you that it's really disgusting to see birds and flies hang around the trashcan right in front of where I'm picking up my food. Food and trash literally overflow. It's a similar case inside the restaurant, especially at the cans near the bathroom. ...  ... Overall this is an okay McDonald's if you just need one that's close by, but don't expect it to be a great McDonald's.

McDonalds is an American fast food restaurant which is slowly gaining popularity in the Phoenix Metro area.  They serve hamburgers, french fries ... ok just kidding ...  ...  ... This is the McDonald's right by my house (btw, is Yelp! safe?) ... and the reason why it's being reviewed is because at lunch time the drive-thru is SUPER SPEEDY!   ...  ... I drive by three McDonald's to get here and they all have ENORMOUS lines, but not this one! ...  ... Big UPS!

I only come here to get their 99 cent bags of ice that are advertised all over their outside windows.  ...  ... Unfortunately, out of 6 visits they have only had the bagged ice once. Why???

This is the short bus of all McDonald's. ...  ... Unfortunately after the economy bit it McD's decided they really didn't want most of the stores open 24 hours everyday and just left a couple of them in the Valley.  This is the one closest to my work but its not like the store locator on their website tells you that. ...  ... One, there are ferociously long lines after bar close.  Hint, you might want to leave another location to the east and North open to help.  Like the one on Camelback or Indian School.   ...  ... Two, if I come at say 3:45am I never know if they are serving breakfast or lunch at this location.  The schedule seems to be determined by how things are progressing in the lunar cycle.  Crack in the Box has figured out how to both simultaneously, why can't McDonald's? ...  ... Three, they can't figure out how to clean their shake machine one side at a time or change when they clean it based on business volume or say overnight temps.  My thought is that if it is not going to go under 100 overnight they should maybe leave it on and clean it 7am.  If I am at loose ends at 3:45 am I may want a shake if its hot out, eh? ...  ... Four, and this is the worst.  I have actually been sitting in line to pick up my food after ordering and listened to the window person chat about the morning news with the vehicle ahead of me.  This has happened more than once!  Are you freaking kidding me?  This is fast food not your local coffee shop.  Oh, wait.  Now they have McCafe so people are confused, right?

REVIEW #5:  1 stars  (304 chars)
Bad service. They were slow to give my order even though they were only a few customers that time. Also I spotted a few homeless guys just outside sitting. Not only that, the place isn't all that neat. Find a spots of dirt on the floor. If it weren't a request of my niece then I wouldn't have gone here.

Bag was stolen by a store employee while I sat and listened to my iPad eating lunch. Caught on video, store manager and owner covering up the situation. Police are now involved and detective investigating the video. Store employee never reported anything to a manager and cleaned out my bag in a cleaning closet in the store.  ...  ... Homeless use this location as a sanitation station. Be prepared to be asked several times for money.  ...  ... Homeless change clothes right in the store.

I only went because I had a coupon for a free Bacon Clubhouse Burger which was as expected... blah.  With all the wonderful Non Fast Food places to get a burger these days (at a fairly competitive price) why ever choose fast fast food?  Really?  Why? ...  ... I haven't been to McDonald's in about 5 or 6 years and no reason to ever go again.

REVIEW #9:  1 stars  (508 chars)
I've been to this McDonald's twice, one month apart, and I've had the same experience twice. ...  ... The hash browns are gross. They taste like they've been fried in old, burned, rotted oil. This is the only McDonald's I've ever been to that's had foul tasting hash browns. ...  ... Both times I've sat inside and both times I've overheard the same bitching several times over... .the manager having to continually tell a male employee (not kidding around), "stop being mean to the customers" and "be nice!"

REVIEW #10:  1 stars  (308 chars)
It was a terrible experience in every possible way. The wait time in the drive thru lane was excessive, the order was incorrect, and the chicken was slimy and smelled like it was rotting.

Slowest DRIVE THRU ever!!!! Also the quintessential SHORT BUS Location. ...  ... I frequented this location around dinner time since it is the closest to my home a few times and every time it is between a 10-15 min ordeal. When i worked at Mickey D's in the early 90's we had what was called 90 sec HBO( Hand Bag Out), from order to picking up should be no longer than 90 secs. This must not be a practiced any longer.  I have to say hello when I drive up to the speaker due to getting no response. Then I get someone who is rude and say's yes. I order the big mac deal, buy 1, get 1 for a $1. The employee says they do not offer that, I advise their menu out front does. After 5 min of silence and cars backing up I pull fwd to make sure he is still living to see what is up. Total lack of cust serv service, he had to have the mgr show him how to ring it up, no apology or anything. This happened each time I went there. C'mon man

Girlfriend says "Want McDonald's for lunch?" ...  ... I'm super hungry.  But I've been trying to do no fast food for Lent.   ...  ... Girlfriend says, "Oh yea, you weren't eating fast food yet, right." ...  ... I see the golden arches in the distance.  Quickly slipping I say, "Um, do we have food at home for lunch?"   ...  ... Girlfriend says, "Not really, we need to go grocery shopping." ...  ... I freaking kid you not, while we wait at the red light freaking church bells go off right behind us.  Yes, automated, on the hour church bells.  I couldn't make this stuff up. ...  ... I say, "Um......" ...  ... The light becomes green and girlfriend says, "Let's just get it.  We'll go shopping later."   ...  ... I hadn't made the decision, so somehow that made it better.  I dove in with both feet. Bring on the Big Mac!!!  Coke has never tasted so cold or so good coming out of that giant straw.   ...  ... And finally, in an act that could almost be a sign from the big G, the McDonald's that has never ever gotten our order completely right - got the whole thing perfect.   ...  ... So if you ever go here, and don't hear the church bells, check your order before you pull away from the drive through as in the past this location actually gave us 2 double cheeseburgers with no meat.

REVIEW #2:  3 stars  (618 chars)
Ok, it's a little silly to review a McDonalds, but I was getting some photos developed at the drugstore next door & was a little hungry for lunch, so I popped into this McDonalds.  The seating was comfortable, the service was friendly & fast, my Angus Bacon & Cheese Burger was delicious, & so was the large ice cream cone for desert. ...  ... As I munched down on this big boy, I glared out the window at 1-Star New Sun Star Super Buffet across the street, & 2-Star King Wah behind it.  This taught me to appreciate McDonalds & write this review.  It's all relative, isn't it? ...  ... Spent $4.98, left happy!   :-))

REVIEW #3:  3 stars  (1795 chars)
There are lots of restaurants on this corner (including 2 Buffets!), but you know how sometimes you're just hungry for McDonalds?     :-)     Ok, never mind. ...  ... So I stopped in here this afternoon for a bite to eat.  When I was here last, 8 months ago, they had just remodeled the place & it was nice inside.  Well, they have remodeled it AGAIN!  Unfortunately, the new floor plan isn't as good as the former one, in my opinion, & they could have bought a lot of paper towels with what they spent here, bringing me to... ...  ... Next gripe:  Last time, along with the air blower in the bathroom, they had an empty paper towel dispenser.  Now, they don't even have that?  After blowing your hands off how are you supposed to open the door without getting them germy again?  (I got lucky when someone else opened the door, but this is no way to run a restaurant!) ...  ... Ok, here's what was GOOD here today: ...  ... *  Super fast service!  Less than one minute from ordering to receiving my food, even though they were busy. ...  ... *  Everything was put together neatly and served up at the right temperature. ...  ... *  The menu board now shows how many calories are in each food item!  I'm still going to eat too many of them, but at least I've been warned!  This IS the way to run a fast food restaurant!     :-) ...  ... *  Excellent value!  I had: ...  ... *  A McDouble (double cheeseburger):  $1 ...  ... *  A Hot & Spicy McChicken Sandwich:  $1 ...  ... *  A perky little Chocolate Shake with whipped cream & a cherry:  $2.19 ...  ... Yay for a tasty meal for $4.19!  Ok, it was also 390+360+570 + 50? (extra mayo on the chicken sand.)=1370 Calories.  Ugh, but I can't say they didn't warn me.     :-O ...  ... If they'd had paper towels I might have given it 4 Stars.     :-)

It's taken me 2 1/2 years to get back around to this McDonald's, here in my neighborhood.  In the meantime, they have done a complete remodel, & it's nice inside, featuring a clean, modern look, & game computers to use (free) at two of the booths!     :-) ...  ... Unfortunately, there WERE some issues this morning, more important than getting to play a game along with eating.  To start with, there was a nice new hand's free paper towel dispenser in the Men's Room, but no paper towels in it!  I tried to dry my hands on the silly air blower for a while, & then when I gave up on that, had to use toilet paper to open the door.  Not ok!     :-O ...  ... There wasn't enough help, so the service was slow.  Also, the coffee also tasted hours old.  (I usually really like McDonald's coffee.)     :-O ...  ... This location could be at least one more Star if they'd just tighten up their act a little. ...  ... Sausage McMuffin with Egg $1.79, Sr. Coffee $.89

The kids that work here are uneducated with lots of attitude. I asked for a double hamburger, so they gave me a mcdouble?? I don't understand how one can misunderstand this! Then they want to stand there and say its they same thing. I shouldn't have to ask for a mcdouble with no cheese if asking for a double hamburger should make sense right!! The only thing that made this trip worth anything was the manager that was super nice and friendly!

REVIEW #2:  3 stars  (1036 chars)
I'm not one of the people who think that they are better than McDonald's. I actually like the taste of the dollar menu items, so life is cheap for me. This location is the closest to our house, so it's the one that we frequent the most. They're one of the few locations to have four piece chicken nuggets for $1 for the kids, so that's a plus. The McCafe, while obviously not specific to this location, is a cool concept. The drinks are pretty good, and about half the price of a Starbucks. The thing that this location is in dire need of, though, is an update/remodel. The inside decor and the seating areas have a worn-out look to them. It seems that every other McDonald's that I've been to recently has been refurbished. They all have the cafe look to them now and some have really fancy play structures. Other than that, the staff is usually very nice and helpful, and we rarely have any mistakes with our order. The extensive dollar menu offerings and helpful staff balance out the dated decor to leave it with three stars for me.

I am livid as I write this. I rarely eat at McD's, but I do stop in for a McRib when it is offered. That was our reason for going this time.  ...  ... Our order was 1 Mcrib, 1 Qtr Pounder, 1 Big Mac, 1 side salad, 1 drink, 1 fry. Five items and a drink.   ...  ... When our bags came through the drive thru window, we did a cursory check and had 5 items in the bag in a quick, efficient manner. When we got home - we had 1 Qtr Pounder, 2 Big Macs, 1 fry, 1 salad and drink. Yeah, it is five items + drink. Not the CORRECT five items.  ...  ... I drove back with 2 big macs, receipt and bagging list (both of which listed mcrib and 1 big mac). I went inside and spoke with the employee there. I said I would like to return the 2 big macs in exchange for a new big mac and a mcrib. He turned around and had the cook make a new mcrib, which he promptly handed to me and said I could keep the other 2 big macs.  ...  ... WTF? How much more plain can I make it? I want a FRESH big mac AND a mcrib, not TWO bigmacs that are now half an hour old (they will be by the time I drive back home).  ...  ... I didn't even bother to argue the point. Why? The store is equipped with thousands upon thousands of dollars in equipment designed to take orders, cook orders, and track orders. The whole process happens in an area 500 square feet. But somehow, even with all of this high-tech equipment tracking your order from start to finish; something as simple as getting FIVE items in a bag correctly is beyond the capability of the multiple staff members that is preparing/checking and serving that order in those 500 square feet.  ...  ... I came home -  and ate a bit of my mcrib. I didn't eat the big macs as they were cold, and who wants to reheat burgers laden with lettuce and special sauce? That's just gross. It could have been a nice treat, but instead I had to log onto the internet and spend what could have been dinner time letting you all know that things like caveat emptor still apply, especially at drive thru windows. Cursory item counts aren't enough.. you have to VERIFY what each item is. I'm paying good money for simple items which are tracked by complex systems and multiple personnel yet somehow such a seemingly simple task can go wrong in the matter of a few feet. I just don't get it. Thanks for nothing, McDonald's.

REVIEW #8:  1 stars  (439 chars)
This McDonald's order came with two sandwiches that had hard bread.  When shown to the manager, he explained they were toasted and had no clue between toasted bread and old hard bread.  I'm 31  years old, I know by now how McDonald's bread should be, and how managers should behave - and it's not like this.  Also, you need a code to enter the restrooms.  There are Mcd's on nearly every corner here, don't choose this one, I know I won't.

So it's just a McDonald's.  So what?  Well, unfortunately (or maybe fortunately) the are not all created equal.  I have been to this location several times.  The staff is friendly for a McDonald's, but I would say it takes roughly twice as long to get my food as it does at other locations.  I don't think I have ever received my food where there wasn't at least something left off of my tray, like a drink, or french fries.  There are so many McDonald's to choose from surrounding this one, I might keep on driving an extra mile or so and visit another location.

REVIEW #3:  1 stars  (397 chars)
Let's face it, McDonald's isn't exactly gourmet fast food, but at least it's fast, right? Wrong! This location blows. The drive thru is unbelievably slow. Worse, I'm not sure what I just ate; the first bite of that Egg McMuffin tasted like dish soap, and it was cold! I might also make one suggestion. It might behoove the owner/operator to have a person who speaks English working the drive thru.

But when I went home too eat my food there was hair.  I called the manager to confront her about it...  the answer I got was I don't know how that happened. We don't have anyone with long hair working the grill. I was offered to have the food remade but between the wait,  hair,  and being questioned. I don't want it remade...

Don't plan on picking up a quick cup of coffee-or anything else-on the way to work! You will waste an easy 10" getting through the drive-through: first No One is manning the order mike and when you get to the window to both pay and get your order-there is complete chaos! They seem uncertain as to what you ordered-try to hand-out a completely wrong order-or are surprised you are sitting in your car outside their window in the first place! This place has ABSOLUTELY the worst McD 's  service of ANY I have been to in this country! Isn't there some award they could receive for this distinction?

K, I had to search for this specific McDonalds.  ...  ... Like I said before, it is what it is. I rate things for what they are beyond what they are... does that make any sense?? ...  ... Anyways, the people here are super friendly. There is a weird trend with fast food in this area- the workers are all oddly friendly. This place is the same way. I really can't justify a 5 star rating for a McDonalds, but I will give it 4 stars considering it's a great place to drive through for a dollar drink from time to time.

McDonald's drive-thru is the girl who's in her pajamas and in for the night but decides she wants a Manhattan and realizes she is out of ice's best friend. $1 for an 8 lb. bag (2 for $1.50) and you don't even have to get out of the car!!

This is the worst McDonalds i have ever been to. (period) ...  ...

Another filthy Mc nasty. The ice machine had no ice and and the girl taking my order seemed pretty slow and there was a ton of purple smoothie on the counter where I placed my order. So I asked the manager for some sauce besides ketchup for my fries and he states the sauce is usually .15 and acts like he's hooking me up...I tell him we're even for the ice situation. Anyways, with the playland in its current condition,  this place is doomed to be an accident waiting to happen.

McDonald's is getting a bad rap here, I can see.  Yeah, it's not the best one out there, but it's not the worst.   Ive only been here for breakfast, so that's what im basing my review on.  I use the drive-thru.. maybe that works too.   ...  ... I get my usual vanilla iced coffee and oat meal in the mornings and have never been disappointed.  The girl at the pay window always seems friendly and has is smiling all the time.  The girl who gives me my food is the same way.  Only time I've had problems was this morning when the manager of all people, didnt give me my spoon!! serious!!!..  just kidding.   ...  ... It's McDonalds.. not a 5 star restaurant..  :)

Ok,, so I am not a big Mickey D fan.  I wanted a mid morning snack and a sausage biscuit so I pull in here only to realize they are being remodeled.  Now I am under the opinion that nobody but the infirm and mothers with screaming babies have the right to add to the carbon footprint by using a drive thru but by this time somebody had already pulled in behind me.  I got what I asked for and a smile at the window.  They fulfilled my expectations so they get a full 3 stars.

I went here to be picked up by a friend, so I decided to grab something to eat ... The guy at the counter seemed a bit too timid to take anyone's order...but at least he actually stopped to take my order...unlike the other girl and guy. Anyhow, the food took a while to come out and it was pretty decent...it was hot. The only true downside is the bubbly brook that is my stomach and I didn't even eat my sandwich...but that's McDonald's for ya haha!

REVIEW #4:  1 stars  (1017 chars)
I know.  I know.  I know.  I know.  Why am I wasting my time yelping about a McDonald's.  But hey sometimes I crave a double cheeseburger and some fries or some hot cakes and an egg mcmuffin.  Also, I am a firm believer that a burger shouldn't have mayonnaise on it.  They are one of the only chains that don't put that disgusting crap on their burgers.  Plus, they serve the best diet coke.  I don't know what it is.  So, please don't hate me.   ...  ... But damn this place is the worst McDonald's I have ever been at.  Every freaking time I have been to the place they have messed up my order.  They either forgot the fries or forgot my sandwich or they don't have pickles for their burgers.  How the hell do you run out of pickles!!!!!  I love pickles..  I really do...  I always order extra pickles when I get a burger.  I only live a couple blocks from this place and I avoid it at all costs and go to one that is 3 miles away.   ...  ... So if you are craving some Mickey D's keep on moving past this location.

It's McDonald's: How do you fuck up McDonald's?  Easy--hire no one who speaks English, consistently serve cold and stale french fries and generally let the store be filthy.   I'm so glad I live in the quasi-ghetto!

Okay so I'm not really a huge McDonald's fan but I come here a lot when I bring girls for mentoring. So as we are sitting and doing work out of a book on a Sunday night (paying customers) the girl that I'm mentoring is smoking her electronic cigarette (no scent and nothing harmful... even airports allow them), the manager literally YELLS across the restaurant "YOU CAN'T DO THAT" and is completely rude and unprofessional. I understand rules and don't mind abiding by them, but to be rude and brash? Unnecessary. Not to mention my burger was cold and there was no ketchup in the containers. The restaurant was practically empty and there was no line. I worked in the restaurant industry for years, I was absolutely disgusted. We won't be coming here to do work anymore. What a jerk?!?

We don't eat at McDonald's on a daily basis by any means, but every now and then in a pinch, we stop here because it's less than a minute from our house.  ...  ... We have yet to ever leave with our entire order 100% correct. They constantly give us the wrong food and usually leave out one or MORE things we ordered.  ...  ... Staff is unpleasant and the managers don't care if you say anything. They're equally unpleasant. Would not recommend this place! I ONLY gave them two stars because the inside is clean and that's important to me.

Drive Thru is a NIGHTMARE.  Food is cold more often than not and the orders are CONSISTENTLY WRONG.

REVIEW #4:  1 stars  (1475 chars)
I'm basically 99% sure I wrote a review of this place about 8 months ago and now there are...no reviews. Is it possible for them to take stuff down? No doubt they wanted all previous reviews removed...it's not just me, the previous stack of bad reviews was proof that this place is seriously the worst McDonald's ever. Frankly I'm surprised that McDonald's Corp continues to allow them to operate this franchise location. Ronald McDonald would roll in his grave. Basically 60% of the time we're told to park. And if it's not me being told to park and wait it's usually the person in front of me. The ice cream machine is "out of order" or "down for cleaning" (your pick) more often than not. WHICH IS TOTALLY AWESOME WHEN YOU'RE IN LINE, SOMEONE PULLS IN BEHIND YOU, YOU ORDER ICE CREAM, THEY DON'T HAVE IT, THEN YOU GET TO WAIT IN LINE TO GET THROUGH THE DRIVE THRU! It would be brilliant if they would post that before the point of no return in the drive thru lane. I don't know what the deal is, if management/owners just don't care or if they don't know what's going on. I'll sum it up with my most recent drive-thru experience there: ...  ... Girl: "Hi, welcome to McDonald's, now featuring the Cherry Berry Chiller! What can I get you?" ... Me: "Can I get 2 medium Cherry Berry Chillers?" ... Girl: "We're out." ... Me: "But you just said you had them..." ... Girl: "No, I said FEATURING. We don't have them." ...  ... And she probably spit in the Sprite I got instead.

It was late Sunday night, and we were hungry and this is the only place open late.  We went to the one on Gantzel, but they weren't accepting anything but cash, which our bank ATM is inside Fry's which was closed.  So we come here, place our order, and our fries are half full, and the buns on the cheeseburgers were so stale the dog wouldn't even eat them!!  No lie!! There was one, very unhappy, seemed put out young woman working the drive through and sorry, but not a good experience!

REVIEW #6:  1 stars  (423 chars)
Wow! What crappy service!! I waited in line at the drive thru. I got to the speaker finally, and they asked me to hold. Sure, no problem. 11 minutes later, and several cars that went into the other lane after me, were all served. I drove up, got to the window and complained. I got an I'm sorry. Then was told I had to drive back through to place my order. I THINK NOT!!! I will never spend another red penny at this place!

I rarely eat McDonald's but my toddler loves their chicken nuggets and this location is one of the only fast food restaurants near my house. I have always had such a pleasant experience here- one time I asked for a cup of water and the guy at the drive through winked and gave me a bottled dasani on the house. Today I went through the busy drive through for a kids meal and was told at the second window that my food wasn't ready and to pull up to the parking lot "drive through number 1" spot. After about 5 minutes they brought out a fresh kids meal and had added in a warm apple pie just for my wait. The drive thru servers are always so polite and although the food leaves much to be desired (it's McDonald's for heavens sake), I appreciate the service when I do visit. The training manager deserves a pat on the back for expecting these minimum wage kids to work so hard!

REVIEW #2:  3 stars  (119 chars)

Absolutely the worst service ever!!!  I waited 18 minutes at the drive thru on sunday afternoon/evening.  I was looking around for the camera because I thought someone was playing a joke.   I took a photo of the receipt as well.  Just a happy meal for my son and after the ridicules wait they tried to give me a dr pepper instead of chocolate milk...  wish I could give 0 stars.

REVIEW #5:  1 stars  (1194 chars)
If I could give this no stars I would. I went through the drive thru, ordered a Big Mac combo meal. I opened it and it was soggy. It had definitely been sitting around. My fries were literally half filled. And the big mac had no sauce. I walked in and politely asked them to add sauce. The manager (or whoever it was) told the cashier to inform me that there would be extra charge. First of all, I ordered it WITH sauce. I informed the cashier (since the manager refused to talk to me) that I wasn't  about to pay extra for something done right that I ordered. Nobody was in there when I walked in. So it shouldn't be a problem right? I told them that I work at a mcdonalds, and this isn't how customers should be treated, especially because I was so calm about it. The cashier finally comes back and says, "they put a lot of sauce" and threw the box at me practically. I didn't take a picture but no exaggeration but it was literally COVERED in sauce. I had to use 8 napkins to wipe the sauce off and even then I couldn't even wipe off the excess. So annoying. I called in and asked politely to talk to the manager just to let them know, and they hung up on me. This experience was ridiculous.

There drive through staff is terrible. Never get orders right and they repeat the wrong orders about 10 times.  I have never gone here and got an order right.

REVIEW #7:  1 stars  (538 chars)
This McDs is the only fast food restaurant (besides Filibertos) open late in this part San Tan Valley, and you think that they would want to have as much business as possible... Then why do they only accept cash most of the time if you go there between 1-4 am? I don't carry cash and especially not that early. I then have to drive all the way in to Queen Creek to get Jack in the Box. That's insane to only take cash (it's not just a one night thing either.) I'm sick of this McDs. Of all the bad service I've had, this one is the worst.

REVIEW #8:  1 stars  (1589 chars)
Very disappointing visit to the Gantzel Road McDonalds.  We went on a Wednesday night.  There was a small line at the drive through but the line did not move at all for several minutes.  Then we waited for over 5 minutes before the order taker would take our order. We finally received our food and headed for home.  When we arrived home, we found that they had neglected to give us a 20 piece McNuggets that we had ordered and paid for. I was upset because somebody did not receive their dinner. I called the McDonalds and complained that we were missing part of our order.  The manager, Michelle, told us to write her name on the receipt and bring it back later and our order would be replaced. After hanging up, I proceeded to eat my food.  One item I had ordered was a Deluxe Double Cheeseburger.  I bit into it and my mouth was soon on fire.  The server had mistakenly put HOT Jalapeno Ranch sauce on my burger.  I could not eat it and threw the rest away.   ...  ... The next day I sent my son to the McDonalds to retrieve the missing 20 piece McNuggets.  We ordered additional food so that everyone at home would have something to eat. Guess what?  When my son got home, again there was missing food.  We had ordered 2 additional 20 piece McNuggets and one of the now three orders was missing.  Also missing was a large French Fry.  This was an incredible amount of incompetence that occurred during two trips to the restaurant.  My advice is to be very careful using the drive-through.window.  Count your items and make sure you have everything you ordered before leaving for home.

went to this mcdonalds today to get my 4 y/o daughter pancakes..advised at the speaker computer down..pull up to second window after an 18 1/2 minute wait got the food..asked to speak to manager if any discount for this wait she listened to my request and walked away did  not say anything else after saying sorry computers are down..i'm a 55 y/o  who does not care if computers are down not ..not my concern maybe they should have someone out side taking written orders to help speed up their process..like in and out burger.. this store is one of the worst not caring for the customers...always have to call the corp customer service line to complain..and yes i know stop going there..but only store that makes pancakes any more...too bad wendys stopped or i would not have this problem or issue

REVIEW #10:  1 stars  (786 chars)
Wow!!  EVERY time we go here, usually for a late night, drive thru run, as we are busy and work tons, our order gets messed up, missing food, or cold  EVERY time!!  No kidding!!  Plus, the fries are usually cold, stale, rarely full, the buns are hard, I mean thump when you flick them (yeah, we had to do this, out of shock!)  One time, we even received a cheeseburger with NO PATTY!!  Of course we didn't know this until we got home!  It's enough that my family KNOWS they MUST check the order EVERY time before they get out of line!!!! They are slow, not polite, and just don't care!  OH, and the other night, Sunday night, on a late night run again, we put in our order thru the drive thru, and then were told they only could accept cash at that time!  Huh, we had to leave.  GRRRR!!

The employees are all exceptionally friendly and appear to appreciate my business. It's very nice to be treated so well.

This is the closest McDonald's to my house.  I like to hit it up for breakfast every once in a while.  I also get dessert here when I have a sweet tooth.  I have never had a problem here.  The staff is always friendly.  Even though it is in a gas station it is really nice for a McDonald's.

I will occasionally stop here for breakfast.  When I do, I order 2 Sausage McMuffins w/no Egg, 1 Hash Browns, $3.27.  The drive thru lane can get slow and jammed up....there's not much room for more than 2 or 3 cars to be in line at the ordering speaker before it starts getting messy. ...  ... One convenient aspect of this location is that there's a gas station attached to it. ...  ... Return Factor - 50%

There are a few reasons why I never go to McDonalds.  1--bad food.  2.--which I just experienced, is an incompetent work force. Unfortunately I live right by this one.   I drove through and ordered a Large Diet Coke.  So I order, I'm told $1.09, pull ahead, blah blah blah.  Anyways, i'm sitting behind the car in front of me for literally 8 minutes.  Now i'm not positive, but I'm pretty sure Mcdonalds has a company policy where large orders that take this amount of time are required to "pull around" and wait to have their food brought to them, to allow small orders, like my Large Diet Coke which takes 13 seconds to fill, "fast food" service.   Well, not so much.   So 8 minutes go by, i'm waiting, i'm waiting, i'm waiting (and there's nowhere to exit at this location), finally I pull up to the window.  Hand the lady my card she runs it, hands me my card, receipt and I realize i've been charged $9.00+.  SO i Say this isn't my order, blah blah blah, and she gets the manager.  Manger yells at the employee, explains proper procedure (which is another time consuming task), all the while i'm sitting here and I just want my fucking Diet Coke and card refunded.  So now i'm dealing with the manager.  Literally took her 2 minutes of constant swiping of my debit card to get it refunded.   She hands me my drink, then she hands me the receipt.   Two of them, first showing i've been refunded, and then she says "the second one is for the drink.", and then she says, "I'm sorry about the wait." ...  ... I told her if she was really sorry I wouldn't' have been charged for the drink.   ...  ...  ... Are you serious?  I just waited in line for 14 minutes for a large fountain drink and you, the manager, the person in charge, don't even have the common sense or courtesy to give me the drink for free?  Are you serious?  Complete and utter incompetence and completely unaware of what the term customer service means. I'm not pissed about being charged $1.  I'm pissed that my time was wasted.

This location is never too busy, clean, staff is friendly, and quick. Here is my synapsis on the current state of McDonalds.  ...  ... McCaf and Breakfast: I went to Starbucks today and paid $6.43 for a Latte and muffin and it wasn't that great. I would much rather have a Vanilla Iced Coffee and Egg McMuffin from McDonalds, it's always tasty and consistent. ...  ... McRib: Rib Meat shapened into a Rib Bear Claw is awesome, I don't care what you aristocrat haters think. ...  ... Salads: Buying a salad from McDonalds is like going to a Mexican restaurant and ordering a cheeseburger. Besides, I don't think I trust salad from a giant fast food corporation. ...  ... Snack Wrap: A satisfying 'in between' meal. ...  ... Burgers: Kinda weird burger meat, but unique, kinda good.

REVIEW #3:  3 stars  (475 chars)
Fairly decent location. ... Weird setup but I guess that's just the way they do things these days.  Compact front of the house where you place your order.  It's like the soda fountains are right behind you.  If you get out of line and there's someone behind you waiting to order you will probably have to excuse yourelf to gain access to the soda fountain. ... The dining area didn't seem very big, in fact it almost seemed to be drawfed by the childrens play area. ... Why?!

Okay, so lately, I've been eating McDonald's more than I should (for breakfast). ...  ... This one is the closest one to my house and it's just fine. I mostly go through the drive-thru, and they're pretty quick with orders. When I do go inside it seems clean. The workers all/mostly seem competent enough. Honestly, I remember this McDonald's used to have the most incompetent workers some years ago. Like, to the point where I'd avoid coming here, even when I wanted McDonald's (who does that?). Glad to see things have improved...

I've been to the McDonald's a few times, only through the drive thru.  What's really  impressive is that they have a double drive thru, which means there's 2 ordering lanes that converge back into 1, so you can process orders twice as fast.  What's impressive is that to keep up, they have to get the food ready at twice the speed.  I'm not sure why this particular location does this, but it's pretty cool....I've never seen anything like that before. ...  ... The food here is average McDonald's food....nothing much to really talk about.  I stop here to grab Breakfast on occasion when I'm on the go and nearby. ...  ... Return Factor - 60%

Sausage McMuffin with egg sandwich and a small coffee with a cream and a sugar: $3:88 ...  ... Why this Mickey D's? ...  ... They're fast. I'm entering the drive-thru at 7:15 and leaving it at 7:18.  ...  ... Location. A stones throw from Raintree/101. ...  ... Consistency. Each day my Sausage McMuff tastes just as good as the day before and the coffee gets me going in the morning. ...  ... Healthy? Eh, sort of. You can get the sandwich and coffee for just shy of 500 calories. The fine print is that they make up for calories with fat and cholesterol. Though, you can substitute the eggs for egg whites. That way you pay the difference now (in cash), instead of when you're 60 (in bypass surgery).

This Mickey D's is convenient to those traveling on Frank Lloyd Wright eastbound or either direction on the 101.   ...  ... This McDonalds is clean and epitomizes what fast food should be.  They offer a fast, efficient and friendly fast food experience, so I believe they deserve the five stars!   ...  ... One suggestion -- since they close to Cobblestone Auto Spa (literally next door), stop there first for gas and a car wash and then walk across the lot and wait for your car to be ready. ...  ...

The guy's order ahead of me was still on the screen when I pulled up to give my order. He ordered 2 large sweet teas. You would have thought that they had to go out, harvest the tea leaves, and retrieve the water from the well!

I am not gonna review the food honestly cause well its McDonalds, it's pretty much the same food every where.  ...  ... The Place-  This place is super clean, it's the cleanest location I have ever been to. ...  ... The Employees- I was actually in tonight at 7pm ordering inside, Kyle was the cashier and was very nice when I asked him a ton of questions about the new food items I saw on the menu.  Another employee who always gives me great service is a blonde girl who runs the window late at night a lot.  ...  ... This is the only McDonalds I like.. Keep it up guys :)

REVIEW #2:  4 stars  (280 chars)
Love my local McD's. Food is prepared well, never get the wrong order and staff is friendly. Great place to cool off and get some lunch. This location also does a ton for the community with the fundraiser and teacher nights for schools and local nonprofits. Good community member.

They are usually pretty good but lately they have been getting my orders messed up. By the time I get to work and discover that my Order is wrong, it's too late to go back.

REVIEW #4:  2 stars  (407 chars)
Serves expired food: -2 stars. (I mean come on, the date and time are printed on the package) Expecting something to be wrong every time I go there: -1 star. (I'm feeling generous today) In reality I have more good than bad experiences here, but the bad ones like: expired food, cold food and rude employees are big. Why do I keep going here you ask? Cuz it's cheap, 24hrs. and practically at my front door.

REVIEW #5:  2 stars  (2102 chars)
The Golden Arches, the most famous fast food place, and always will be. The food isn't exactly fresh, but it's not bad either. ...  ... Because the menu never changes, other than seasonal specials. I've eaten most of the menu in a very long space of time. I'll start with the Big Mac, I've eaten a lot of them, and they're not all great for me. I just think the middle bun makes the whole thing dry, especially when you have two ultra thin burgers that have to be cooked to oblivion. I LOVE the Big Mac sauce, so that's why I buy it again. I usually buy a Double Cheeseburger, I love American cheese, and it's so simple. I also adore pickles, although I do wish they ridged them thicker cut. The best meal on the menu are the Chicken Selects, the breading is herby, salty and crunchy, and the chicken juicy. They come with custom sauces, and I tend to buy one sour cream and one BBQ, two BBQ's means you have to buy another milkshake to tame the spice. ...  ... The only side I buy at McDonalds are their famous fries, there is no point in buying anything else, because it's too expensive for what they are. The fries are amazing though, when they are cooked properly. Crisp, addictive and beautifully salted. They eclipse KFC and Burger King. I always have them with pepper, it gives them a kick. The sauces are great too, the ketchup is clearly Heinz, but the BBQ sauce by the pump is smoky and sweet, and very delicious. ...  ... The milkshake is the best though, I love sweet things, and with a milkshake you always have enough to quench your thirst polishing off a Big Mac, and then enough to count as dessert. I always get chocolate, but prefer the vanilla, it's a shame you can't get it a lot. Desserts wise, I ditch the McFlurry and buy a Toffee Sundae. A sizable amount of soft serve, a generous drizzle of toffee, for 99p. Cheap, and delicious. ...  ... So there's my review, it's not great food and you know it'll kill you if you eat too much of it, but there's something about it that makes you come back, and that's why is the most popular fast food chain in the world, and always will be.

REVIEW #6:  1 stars  (845 chars)
I live very close to this location and after today, I will go out of my way to never dine at or get food to go from this location ever again.  ...   ... It seems as though every time I order from here my order is wrong. It is usually my wife's food that they get incorrect so I have to return to the restaurant so that they can correct the order and by the time I get back home, my food is cold and practically inedible.  ...  ... I've complained to management 3-4 times and sometimes they just remake my order and others they gave me coupons. This is a good policy, but how about working on getting an order 100% correct? Once in a while is one thing, but this happens a majority of the time.  ...  ... My advice, go to the location on 64th st and Greenway. They seem to have it together. Better yet, there is a Wendy's right across the street.

When I first moved to Phoenix in 2006 I was so moved by the exemplary service and high quality of McDonald's food at this location that I wrote an email letting them know how I feel. I felt this was the best served, freshest tasting McDonald's food I had experienced and the staff was always great and professional. Because of my praising email, they mailed me two free extra value meal coupons. Very nice. All McDonald's should be like this one.  ...  ... I recognize it is weird reviewing chains (especially a McDonald's), but this one I feel deserved it. Still don't like it? Tough.

REVIEW #2:  4 stars  (365 chars)
I wanted to share an update about this McDonalds because the Manager Obviously cares about what folks are saying. I was presented with a number of Coupons and a letter apologizing for the bad service. Since then I've there a couple times and my order has been taken and provided without ANY FLAWS!! ...  ... Great job and KUDOS to the Mangers for fixing all issues.

REVIEW #3:  3 stars  (364 chars)
Not really sure why everyone are giving this place a bad review.  I don't usually rate chain stores, but since they offer a lot of choices under the $1 menu for people on the move, I usually just get those items.  I get fast services every time I go there, it's hot cheap food for less.  Always the correct orders unlike most of the people giving bad reviews here.

No Shamrock Shakes!!!!! This was stop number 2 on our hunt to find shamrock shakes well before they should stop carrying them (1 week before St Pattys day). They claim to be "out of the mix today". Right, we have heard of that before. In any other business someone would get fired for not buying enough to meet demand. What is McDonalds problem???

REVIEW #5:  1 stars  (235 chars)
I have been to this particular McDonald's location twice now. Each time they have forgotten to give me my sauce for my McNuggets. Of course this was after I left that I noticed, and eating nuggets without any sauce just isn't the same.

REVIEW #6:  1 stars  (543 chars)
I wanted to give this McDonalds NO STARS, but I didn't know if I could.  Anyway, if you want your order WRONG, this is the place to be!! I have gone here on many occasions and out of 10 orders, 8 have been wrong. Be careful when Ordering a Sausage McMuffin, you will GET EGG PUT ON IT THERE.  I even took my order back and they gave me the same thing again WITH EGG, when I specifically said SAUSAGE MCMUFFIN!!!  I love all people and I am not racist but, if you gonna work in AMERICA you gotta not only SPEAK English, but UNDERSTAND it too!!!

it just got an update and it looks so shiny and new! i stopped in to buy a gift card for my mom. she loves riding her bike like 100 miles and stopping at McDonalds for a coffee in the winter, ice cream in the summer. bless her heart! ...  ... i don't eat meat anymore, so there's no real need for me to go to McD's except their coffee is pretty good at a fraction of the cost of Starbucks. great looking store!

REVIEW #3:  3 stars  (463 chars)
Damn you Big Mac! Something about that magical combination of two all beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions on a sesame seed bun that occasionally calls me into a McDonalds. Big Mac fans should know that Culinary Dropout (Scotttsdale, AZ) has a gourmet version of a Big Mac that will blow your freaking mind! FYI - They just tore down the old location here and built a new ultra-modern one with a double drive-thru and laptop workstations.

At the register was a very friendly and courteous employee named Heather.  Despite the massive line for lunch, she maintained a nice smile and was gracious to everyone including me.  She gets 5 Stars for her service and deserves recognition. ...  ... The new Bacon Habanero Ranch Quarter Pounder was pretty good, but not great.  For a McDonald's it's a pleasant surprise. At least they're trying to improve their products.  The McDouble is a nice, cheap regular item I get. ...  ... Return Factor - 70%

REVIEW #7:  3 stars  (328 chars)
It's your average McDonald's.  Fast service, average fast food.  I was running around and needed a quick lunch, so I went through the drive through and ordered 2 McDouble's from the value menu the other day.  It's a McDonald's, so my expectations aren't high... ...  ... Not bad for less than $2.50. ...  ... Return Factor - 50%

REVIEW #8:  2 stars  (1358 chars)
Had I written this review before the remodel, it would have been an easy 4 stars.  Since the remodel, it's been a debacle.   ...  ... First, the double drive through may be good for traffic control in this shopping center, but having both lines merge to one window is not always easily managed.  I've been to the window and been offered the wrong order, only to be given the right order, which turned out to be the wrong order anyway.  There is a difference between egg McMuffins and sausage McMuffins.  That difference is 70 calories and 10 grams of fat.  If they do that to me 50 times, I will gain an extra pound. ...  ... And speaking of food, it's crappy half the time now.  Chicken is dry and chewy...except last time when I was asked to pull around and wait in front.  So much for drive thru.  Had great chicken that day.  Too bad they bagged the fries upon ordering, so they were cold by the time the chicken cooked.  And the fries often have that cold, old grease been sittin' way too long texture. ...  ... And the employees?  They must have had 100% staff change upon reopening: ...  ... "May I take your order?" ... "Yes, I would like a 5-piece chicken strip order, a southern style chicken sandwich, a large order of fries, a small Coke, and a large Iced tea." ... "So that's a large iced tea, and what else?" ...  ... Repeat, Every Single Time.

New drive through is a wreck waiting to happen. Two lines ordering at the same time and then you have to get into one lane. It was crowded and everyone thinks they should rush ahead at the same time. What a ridiculous design!

REVIEW #11:  2 stars  (334 chars)
Went through the drive through. After placing our order it felt like we waiting 1/2 hour. It was probably 8 minutes, but no one greeted us ,let us know  it would be awhile. etc. ...  ... Almost drove off without the order - had I done that this would be a one-star review. ...  ... The positive? Cookies had just come out of the oven.

REVIEW #12:  1 stars  (540 chars)
I am getting SICK AND TIRED of this McDonald's always messing my order up.  Sometimes I liked to go to the drive thru at 7am en route to work so I can eat a McGriddle, Sausage McMuffin WITHOUT EGG and a nice coffee!  I would say that 90% of the time, they put the nasty EGG on the mcmuffin! I am always tempted to check my order at the winder and look at my McMuffin!  I should REMOVE THE EGG part and DROP it onto the concrete!  However, I have not done that.  Instead - I am just NOT going to patronize this particular McDonald's anymore!

REVIEW #13:  1 stars  (196 chars)

I love this mcDonald's not just for its food but for it's 50's decor and ambience. One of the nicest Micky D's I've ever been in, for one thing. It is well kept up and maintained and their staff is top-notch.  ...  ... I love their food and whenever I am in the area, I come for the Saturday car shows.

REVIEW #3:  4 stars  (765 chars)
Time for a review update.  I still love this place for the Saturday car shows, they get 5 Stars for that.  It's the longest running car show in Arizona I believe.  It's so much fun and it's free. ...  ... They get a bump up in stars because over the past 2 yrs, they've delivered great customer service and the food is always fresh by fast food standards.  Also, McDonald's has stepped up it's menu and offered a variety of new items that are tasty and unique.  Their Iced Coffee is very good...and I'm not a Coffee drinker. ...  ... I come here primarily for breakfast and an occasional lunch....and the car shows. ...  ... If you have a free Saturday night and like cars, give it a try....especially during the nice weathered months. ...  ... Return Factor - 100%

REVIEW #4:  3 stars  (951 chars)
3 Stars for the food, 5 Stars for the unique experience..... ...  ... I stopped by this McDonald's location for a quick lunch one day and ordered 2 Double Cheeseburgers and Large Fries.  While I was waiting for my food, someone told me about a free car show they host in the parking lot every Saturday night. ...  ... My food was ready and I had a decent lunch.  It's McDonalds, so my expectations are pretty low.  Not bad for a quick meal. ...  ... I then returned the next Saturday night to check out the car show.....it was pretty cool!  There are probably close to 100 cars here....everything from old classics (Chevy's, Corvettes, Camaros, Mustangs) to newer rice rockets (Acuras, Hondas, Toyotas) to exotics (Ferrari's, Lambos).  I was amazed!  Best part....it's FREE! ...  ... By the way.....the McDonalds was packed and making tons of money.....great idea! ...  ... Return Factor - 100% (the Car show was a lot of fun, will definitely be back)

When we lived in Chicago, one of the fun things our kids always enjoyed after a trip to the Adler or Science Museum was a visit to the "Rock 'N Roll McDonalds" on Clark Street.  http://www.yelp.com/biz/rock-n-roll-mcdonalds-chicago ...  ... Well, this is our own mini Arizona version of that Mickey Ds. ...  ... Most fast food places can only aspire to Three Stars in my book, given their uniform bland sameness.  The only differentiation are the employees or the theme/setup of the restaurant. How many of us like In 'n Out just for the ambiance?   ...  ... I'm not saying the folks who make the Animal Style have anything to worry from the Oakbrook crowd.  But, this Mickey Ds is fun. It even has pictures (not labeled) of the first restaurant that Ray Kroc built in Des Plaines, IL  It also has baseball cards, and other collectibles throughout the restaurant.  Nice! ...  ... All of the employees who work here seem to care and work hard at keeping the place clean and nice. ...  ... So in Yelp-ese, yes they're "Three Stars, A-OK". They check all the boxes to earn those three stars.  But, I would say they deserve an extra half star for it being interesting and fun, as well.

REVIEW #6:  2 stars  (1172 chars)
Decided to stop by here (for the first time) last week for a quick fix. I'm not sure if this was an isolated incident, but this was not up to par with the consistency that I would expect eating at any other golden arches restaurant. In fact, both my Big Mac and my girlfriend's were surprising dry! I'm sorry but the secret sauce was not enough to save them! To top it off, we order combos and they really skimped out on the fries (the french fry containers were not overflowing full as I'm used to getting from other Mickey Dee's).  ...  ... Also, since they were new and for a "limited time" (and thank the man upstairs for that), we tried out the McBites instead of our usual McNuggets, only to find ourselves in utter disappointment. The McBites were super dry and very hard with very little meat to be found. They were more like fried batter that were sitting too long under a heat lamp. I'm not sure if I'd ever give this location a try again, there were just too many strikes in one instance. Moreover, we went through the drive-thru so it's not like we could've complained to the manager if we ate inside. Overall, this was a bad first impression at this location.

REVIEW #7:  2 stars  (825 chars)
It's rare that I leave myself enough time to have breakfast before schlepping to work, but today happened to be one of those days (purely by accident (aka stupid garage door drama) I assure you!) so I head over to the McD's and order a #1 (Egg McMuffin) w/ a chocolate chip frappe... ...  ... Let's get this straight, right out the box...there are 4 stars for the frappe and my crispy delicious potato and negative 2 stars for the McMuff due to the dried up crusty piece of gristly canadian bacon and the not fully cooked egg...gross!  ...  ... G'bye protein! So I ended up with a grilled cheese english muffin... ...  ... I guess I should in some way thank them for pushing me one step closer to being the vegetarian I occasionally toy with becoming. My stomach is still churning at the memory of wet egg in my mouth. *hork*

I don't normally write reviews about fast food joints... In fact, I don't normally EAT at fast food joints.  ...  ... I pulled into the drive-thru for a quick chicken sandwich before a movie. I ordered my food, nothing crazy, just a crispy chicken sandwich with a little ranch added. I pulled up behind a car at the second window and then WAITED FOR TEN MINUTES. I know that isn't a huge amount of time, but what the hell were they doing in there? It's McDonald's! It's supposed to be super fast! When I finally got to the window, it was then another almost five minute wait. I asked the guy what was going on and said "there was a mixup with my food". Huh? You mean my lonely little chicken sandwich with ranch and pickles? Jeez, sorry to confuse you all! ...  ... Well, i finally got it, with like 5 minutes to spare before my movie. There was barely any ranch on it and it was cold. Blech. ...  ... This just reinforces why I never eat at crappy places like this. I guess it's my own fault.

Went tonight (Saturday) and ordered a dipped cone for my grandson. Was told they had no dipped cones..hmmm.  Ordered a small French fries. They were the worst ever I have ever had at a McDonalds. They were cold, rubbery, and almost as bad as the manager who refunded my money after my insistence. This during the Saturday night car show . Store busy, no excuse for bad food and service. Will not be visiting this McDs again.Will gladly pay extra and go to Dennys...

While my daughter was enjoying the awesome play area, I was afforded the opportunity to reminisce about how treacherous this location's drive-thru can be. ...  ... If your order is easy, naturally, all is well. But if you order a large or specialty order that requires you to pull into the "we need more time to fix your stuff" spaces,  look out. ...  ... These spaces are located just past the second window at the end of the drive-thru, just as the lane turns left and narrows. So, if  you drive a big vehicle, you'll end up blocking the whole lane, causing a massive traffic jam.  ...  ... So, a word to the wise...if you are ordering a lot, bite the bullet and go inside. It'll most likely end up saving you time and unnecessary frustration.

I ordered a meal and asked to get a napkin to wipe soda off of the side... apparently Nallelly didn't like that. When I asked for honey and bbq. She gave me bbq and I asked again for honey. She rolled her eyes grabbed honey. Whispered to her coworker and they both laughed. She then hands me a sliced open honey.  Refused to give me her name but I read her badge.  I called manager and he blamed it on box cutting knife.  " I'll ask her about it but I'm sure she didn't do it. " I told him I saw her. He said "I'm sorry but all I can do is ask her what happened it was just the box cutting knife." No offer to call me after he  talked to her and follow through with me. Nothing. Bad service. Bad management.  NEVER AGAIN.

The husband asked for McD's tonight so I humored him and agreed to go. I figured DT wouldn't be a problem since they are normally pretty fast. The car infront of me at the speaker was placed on hold for every bit of 5 minutes. They ordered a single cone. Now it's my turn, I place my order with the unfriendly crew voice that clearly came across the speaker. Of course after I placed my order and pulled forward I realize I didn't order everything. I figured that I'll just pull around and go in and order the forgotten items. The young man at the cashering window apologized to the car in front of me for the wait. I pull up, he takes my money, returns with the change (without a receipt) and tells me to pull forward. No apology for the wait when I waited forever as well. My double digit order was obviously less important than the $1.08 cone in front of me. Now I feel slighted, upset and undervalued. I pull up to the window, the young gal verifies two items of my order and begins the hand out process. I check the bag for the receipt, it's  not there. I ask the gal for a receipt, she asks "he didn't give you one?" If he did why would I ask for another? Hello? Really now!?!  I pull around, park and head inside to see a single line with 7 people and a lone cashier that was not happy. I begin to wait (I'm not so patient at this point) and wait. Two people in front of me walked out due to the wait. There were no smiles, no personality from the counter cashier or the manager who finally decided to open the second register and take an order or two. Each guest was asked for their name that was then written on the receipt in an attempt to personalize the service. A friendly smile would have gone so much further. Finally it's my turn, by now there are two people behind me. I place my simple order of 6 doubles plain, and begin to wait again. the time stamp on the recipt was 7:05. Every guest that was ahead of me was called for pick up. I'm thinking my wait would finally be over. Oh heck no! It wasn't that kind of visit. The two guests behind me received their orders before me!! I continue to wait, really upset by now. I was finally called, the time is now 7:15pm. 10 minutes! This on top of the 10 minutes in the DT trail. Once again no apology for the wait. The store was obviously understaffed, the interior had numerous dirty tables and many trays stacked on the garbage receptacles. The staff was completely underwhelming and in my opinion rude for not offering an apology for the extended waits at both the DT and the counter. I will not be returning to this location as it is not fast and they certainly didn't value my patronage. I certainly don't need the aggravation and honestly I work too hard to spend my money where I'm not appreciated!

Went for coffee at this McDonalds today.  Three of their rising stars were in the drive through line, eividently the microphone at the menu had the day off.  With three of their brightest doing the work of a sign and a microphone, the line was backed up and getting worse by minute.  The courtesy of the staff was beyond lacking and the dolts who lined up for McDONALDS was scary.  I went inside to get my coffee having given up on the "helpful trio in the drive through" only to be met by the team who weren't good enough to qualify for the parking lot gig.  I would recommend dumpster diving over going to this restaurant.  Unless you are in a coma or have nothing else better to do, I would avoid this place.  WOW.

Eff you McDonalds, eff you!  ...  ... You told me you had "Real Fruit Smoothies" that were blended to perfection and offered at a reasonable price. You drilled that idea in my head for weeks with your incessant advertising on the sides of buses and mile high billboards with pictures of creamy, fruity smoothies that made my mouth salivate instantly. You knew that I loved smoothies so much that I would go to great and dangerous lengths to obtain one of your so called "Real Fruit Smoothies". You knew that even though I loathed you and everything you stand for, that I would risk it all, risk everything to venture into your mustard arches to try one of your smoothies.  ...  ... As soon as I walked in and looked around, I knew immediately that I didn't fit in. I won't get into specifics, but let's just say that many of your patrons have the "I don't have a job and I don't care because I get unemployment checks" look about them. Just sayin'. After I made my way through a throng of screaming kids running around barefoot, I finally made it to the counter. I decided to play it safe and order a strawberry banana smoothie thinking that you couldn't possibly mess that classic flavor up. I wasn't actually able to see you make this "Real Fruit Smoothie", as it was mysteriously whipped up behind the scenes in the back somewhere. I would say that next time I'll pay more attention, but unfortunately for you, there won't be a next time.  ...  ... After I made my way out of that hell hole and into the safety of my car, I took my first sip of your much hyped smoothie. I was instantly disappointed. By the time the liquid mush you call a smoothie hit the back of my throat, I knew that I had been duped. I took one more sip just to make sure that I hadn't missed something the first time, and threw the rest out.  ...  ... McDonald's....come on. You don't make a "Real Fruit Smoothie" by blending up strawberry juice and banana flavored puree with some ice and yogurt and call it a smoothie. You're supposed to use REAL FRUIT! That drink was about as "real" as Joan Rivers face, or Pam Anderson's boobs...you might fool some dumbasses out there, but I think most people would rather pay a few bucks more and get the real deal down the street at Jamba Juice.  I mean, how hard is it to mess up a blended drink? Congratulations McDonald's, you never cease to amaze me....

Regular Fast food for our Mcdouble hamburger and Vanilla milk shake. One mistake today.....my vanilla turned chocolate milk shake.

REVIEW #2:  2 stars  (1623 chars)
Now that I have come clean to the Yelp community about my occasional dabbles with chains I feel it is best to cut right to the quintessential original chain. ...  ... I myself very seldom get anything from McDonald's but I have kids that enjoy their french fries and the wraps they affectionately call "Crap Snacks" ...  ... Additionally my wife is not a coffee drinker and her preferred caffeine delivery method is diet coke.  So the fast food joints not infrequently get the business for the diet cokes. ...  ... The reason this particular McDonald's bears yelping is that it holds a singular record, one that I am at this point hoping it will maintain.  Once a record is set I sometimes loathe to see it fall. ...  ... You see, this particular McDonald's has been visited by myself or members of my immediate family not less than 12 times.  On not one of those occasions have they produced a mistake free order.  Not once.  It's really rather remarkable.  It's not like we routinely order dramatic variations such as "No ketchup" or the dreaded "Can you put Big Mac onions on that?" ...  ... Yet they have steadfastly achieved at least one mistake on each and every order, without exception.   ...  ... On the occasions when we visit this McDonald's we now wait with baited breath while someone checks the bag and confirms that yes, indeed there is something we did not order in the bag or we are missing something we did order or something we ordered is not right.  Please, in the name of all that is Mass Consumerism in America, do not get this order correct!  We have standards!  There are bigger issues at play here!

REVIEW #3:  1 stars  (230 chars)
I asked for fresh fries and it took 10 mins to get them. The manager was leaving and had to go in and remind them to bring them. They weren't hot so I called in and they said they would send me a gift card, I've yet to receive it.

REVIEW #4:  1 stars  (416 chars)
I've been here three times and every time there was something wrong with my order. FIRST off they put TRASH inside my ice cream... I've gotten used napkins, half my order, half filled drinks, and when I ordered a chocolate dipped ice cream cone there was something sharp sticking out... This place is totally disgusting and every time I brought my order back they acted like I was a bother and that always happens...

REVIEW #5:  1 stars  (201 chars)
It's been 2 1/2 years since I posted my original review and this McDonald's still sucks!  We have learned to drive to the McDonald's on Alma School near Ocotillo as it has much better food and service.

REVIEW #6:  1 stars  (727 chars)
This has got to be the WORST McDonald's ever.  I have lived less than a mile from it for 4 years.  I am not big on McDonald's, but my kids are.  I have learned to drive miles out of my way to go to another McDonald's. ...  ... Inevitably, though, out of laziness or maybe hope, I keep trying this McDonald's only to have the order screwed up or something to be wrong with the food (stale french fry grease anyone?)  or both.   ...  ... Nothing like the look of disappointment on a child's face when their french frys taste of stale grease.   ...  ... I am not sure if this is a franchise store or corporate owned, but it has consistently been TERRIBLE for FOUR YEARS. ...  ... This McDonald's just needs to be NUKED from orbit.

It's Mc Donalds!! I can lay in bed, check in and write a review. Literally, it is that close!! Ha Ha! Much like the reviews people leave for Denny's and other lower end eating facilities that make them sound like they are supposed to be 4 star, this isnt going to happen with me. Its fries, shakes and imitation burgers - I lived in Napa, I know the difference now!  ...  ... So yes, its newer. Its almost always busy, the next closest drive thru Mc Donalds is up the road - oh, and they are building a new one at Reems and Greenway.

REVIEW #2:  2 stars  (1377 chars)
I don't know if I'm just being pretentious but why do we expect so little from fast food restaurants, anymore I can't feed myself in a drive thru for less than $7-8 which would buy me a much more appetizing lunch at some other restaurants  ...  ... I find that no matter what this location always misses something on my order, If I'm lucky they just short me the condiments that they asked me if I wanted over the speaker, otherwise they will just give me the wrong order or neglect to put sandwiches in the bags, usually our exchanges are silent, because have a nice day or thank you would be borderline on some form of customer service. it just worries me that if this is this nations next great generation that will be entering the workplace in a few years that can't even say thank you or have a nice day when they thrust an overpriced quarter pounder and fries through the window what do my fellow generation Y,X er's have to look forward to in the coming years. ...  ... I guess my biggest point of conflict is the use of the "Double Checked for Accuracy" stickers that McDonald's started using to seal the bags, which apparently someone at corporate thought paradoxical stickers that create the illusion of quality is better than actually fulfilling the prophecy, personally I would feel better if they said " Half-Assed and Over Priced" preferably with smiley face too.

Not a fan of this store.

REVIEW #4:  2 stars  (546 chars)
The food is exactly the same as any other McD's, so what I'm rating is the service. It's not great!  ...  ... My number 1 pet peeve at a drive through is when you pull up & sit there without being acknowledged for what seems like an ETERNITY. Is it really that hard to say, "I'll be with you in a moment"? Apparently at this establishment it is. ...  ... The other thing this particular restaurant has done quite often is get some part of my order wrong. I ask for Dr. Pepper, I get Coke. It's little stuff, but still not what I asked & paid for.

REVIEW #5:  2 stars  (406 chars)
This is the closest McDonalds by my house so out of convenience we go here most of the time.  It always feels like the fries are old.  And McDonalds fries are my favorite, so it kills me that the ones at the McDonalds are so bad.  I hope they improve, but if they did then I would just be compelled to eat there more often.  Maybe they are actually doing me a favor by not making their fries too delicious?

REVIEW #6:  1 stars  (306 chars)
DO NOT DRIVE AWAY WITHOUT CHECKING YOUR ORDER!!  And the reason  why I'm yelling is so you don't miss this lol. This place is terrible. Horrible management; staff is very inexperienced; food is 3 out of 10; "pull up and we will bring you the food" 20 minutes later.  Get the drift ?!?This place is no good.

REVIEW #7:  1 stars  (808 chars)
I eat at McDonalds....I grew up on happy meals :)  Every so often I feel like having the Mcdonald fries(when I am having my cheat meal). ...  ... In review of this Mcdonalds I sometimes avoid this one and go to another so I can enjoy my fries and food!  This is the closest one to my house, but when I have a McDonalds craving I would like to have "good" McDonalds.   ... I want salty, lightly greased fries, this McDonalds always lacks salt, dry fries, and most of the time they are give me luke warm fries.  By the time I get home, the fries are cold?  I live within a mile of this one!  If you are looking to enjoy some McDonalds fries this McDonalds never seems to get the taste right and I avoid it when I get that craving..... If you want salt less fries, cold buns on your burger visit this McDonalds.

REVIEW #8:  1 stars  (1455 chars)
I made this account just so I could do a review on this place. ...  ... Ok giving this Mcdonalds 1 star as I will not be going there anymore. ...  ... I just moved to Surprise in Oct. 2012 and so far been to this Mcdonalds 6 times. Out of the 6 times 4 of the orders were wrong. I'm reading other reviews and this stuff has been happening since 2009???? Really? I would think they would get things right. ...  ... So on one of my orders, I order a chicken CBO burger, I get meat. Than on another order I ask for crispy chicken, I get grilled. The 3rd mess up I asked for a Fish sandwich. Let me say this again A FISH SANDWICH, and they give me a meat one again.  Finally today I ask for large fries and drink, they ring me up for large fries but give me medium drink. But not only that, when I first got the drink it wasn't even my drink! They were handing me food from the person behind me. They didn't even ask if this is what I order. ...  ...  Never have I been to a fast food place that messes up orders this much. It's a joke of a place. They can't say "well other fast food places do this". No they don't! Not even other McDonalds do this! Maybe it's someone telling me to stop eating fast food when I'm too lazy to cook hahaha. But in any case I'm done going to this one. ...  ... Edit: Oh and like someone else said, their fries have been super bad all 6 times I have gone there. They are never hot, only slightly warm and no salt at all on them.

REVIEW #9:  1 stars  (345 chars)
Not a great experience.... lobby area was not filled. Had to wait for lids. Food was below par. People were streaming in from drive thru to correct orders of missing and wrong food. Inappropriate language from counter workers during a slow period. Manager was standing right there next to them and seemed to have no problems with their behavior.

Wish I could give this place NO STARS! They continue to drop the ball on customer service and food quality. I mean you can't expect much from McDonald's period these days but GEEZE! This place is a joke! They manage to mess up the simplest orders and then proceed to give as much attitude as possible when correcting any issue. This location needs to go back to the drawing board! Send the whole staff back to McDonald's university so they can be retrained on EVERYTHING!!! If you are tempted to stop here think twice and if it's not too far go to the McDonalds inside of Walmart at El Mirage and Thunderbird it's much better.

You know that gross taste way too old iced tea has ??? Well that is what i got from here. I know if that happens they aren't fallowing their labeling and dumping the old stuff rules.

I don't believe this place !!! If it was privately owned as a single restaurant it would have gone bust within 6 months. You have to be a certified idiot to get a job here. You try to give your order to an imbecile who has not got past the 3rd grade, and works the cash register also. After 3-4 tries she finally has your order right. After a 15-20 minute wait, your single cup of decaf comes up, right? Hell no. It all comes out of the same pot, the pot without the orange decaf band. There were two cups up at the same time, when i asked which one was the decaf and the coffee, the smart alec said "take your pick, we only have regular rright now" This is the worst experience at a McDonalds i have ever had and i am not alone, at least 4 customers were complaining about there order not being right. Never again!!!!!  Mcdonalds, get a grip and check this place out.

REVIEW #6:  1 stars  (908 chars)
I should know better.  I know. ...  ... McDonald's generally wouldn't get more than a three for average service, but you know sometimes you get that craving and for me, I hadn't had it in a loooong time.  Long and tiring day at work sometimes needs to be offered a little unhealthy nostalgic fast food. ...  ... It's even worse when McDonald's employees don't even care to be there.  Seriously, how hard is it to put together a burger? ...  ... My BigMac came without a piece of meat and without cheese.  When I pointed out their error, the employee giggled and shrugged her shoulders and handed me another one moments later. ...  ... Dumb. ...  ... Then they had a huge banner that said "Happy People Day" or some wierdness...signed by employees.  When I asked what it was about, they didn't even know. ...  ... Duuumb.  You have a huge banner celebrating something that you're not even sure the reason for?

This may be the worst McDonalds in Arizona.  Poorly designed facility makes it almost impossible to access soft drinks and condiments.  To top it off, the food is usually stale or cold.

REVIEW #10:  1 stars  (693 chars)
Very terrible service. People have screwed up EVERY order i've made. Three times they've handed me a drink that opened and spilled all over my door in the drive thru after I've asked them to make sure it was secure. Once I waited for 25 minutes for 10 cheese burgers I was taking to a group of people who were helping me at an event. ...  ... I've asked them specifically not to put things on my food and still they do. I told the girl I was deathly allergic to pickles (not true, but told her this so to make sure they were not on the burger) and yet my burger still had pickles. ...  ... Luckily this McD's has made me not want fast food anymore. If I go to McD's I get a parfeit or oatmeal.

REVIEW #11:  1 stars  (309 chars)
What a joke. No counter person at all. They just looked at me while I stood there. Hey Isaiah, stop flirting with your female burger flipping coworker and do your job?  No professionalism at all. A bunch of damned morons to tell you the truth. I will avoid this place in the future. I walked out I was so mad.

This place is actually a new fancy Mc Cafe. Inside looks like a starbucks with wood finishes, pendant lights and wood flooring. VERY NICE for a McDonalds. We just ventured in for a Free Mc Flurry.

The playground here is a lot of fun.  We came here on our way up to Flagstaff and the kiddo loved the playground!  I liked it, too, because you didn't have to do a whole lot of crawling trying to get to your kid.   ...  ... We had breakfast there and food was par with other McD's.

Chicken wings.  When we asked if they were regular or spicy we were told regular.   Wrong!   They have a kick.  IMHO. If you are going to do a national roll out on the product, you should test your employee's knowledge before putting them on the register. ...  ...   The store we went to didn't even have signage up.  We had to ask If that location had the wings.   Now before you tell me they are just teens,  this was lunch time, in a senior community, during a school day, and the person who waited on us was mid to late 20s. ...  ... The wings are pre cooked, spicy, and a lot of breading.

REVIEW #7:  2 stars  (285 chars)
Maybe its new, but it sure is on the slow side?  Maybe I got a bad crew day.  The employees sure were unfriendly and seriously 1 napkin for 3 meals?  1 sauce for 10 nuggets?  I had to keep asking for stuff.  Maybe more fast food places like this will make me not want to eat fast food.

REVIEW #8:  2 stars  (1001 chars)
Why bother to ask what kind of sauce I want for nuggets at the time of order if you aren't going to add them to my bag at the drive-thru window. Not just isolated either, its EVERY time.  I always have to remind them about the sauces even though its on my order ticket.  I can't even remember a time when they got my order 100% correct.  Took my son there today.  Time was around 2pm so not busy at all.  Went through the drive thru.  Ordered a mighty kids meal for a BOY and when asked what kind of sauce for his nuggets I specified sweet n sour.  Also ordered a #1 combo with diet coke.  Think thats a pretty simple and straight foward order right? Well of course I get to the window and no sauce in the bag so I ask for the girl for some sauce.  Hand my son his mighty meal and he freaks out because they gave him a princess toy!  This is not good!  So I have to now park and go inside just to swap the darn toy!  I sure hope that management reads these reviews so they can make the changes needed.

REVIEW #9:  1 stars  (359 chars)
Awful. 6 times in 6 visits and every order incorrect. Maddening. The last was a quarter pounder with cheese where they forgot.....the cheese.....there's just no excuse. 6 times is just too much of a coincidence which leads me to believe that the workers here are neglectful, forgetful and Just don't give a fig. I'm done with you guys and MacDonald's, period.

Dumb dumb DUMB. Shame on me. I went back here again after I swore I wouldn't. Ordered a #4 combo - that's 2 cheeseburgers - plus diet coke, at the drivethru. Get my order and reach in the bag to feel around. I can feel a frickin BOX in there. Lo and behold, they've given me a single filet-o-fish in the bag!! Back home I take a sip of the diet coke, and stop dead. Give it to my wife. She confirms. It's regular coke. IDIOTS! This place should be shut down, it's the absolute worst McDonalds I have EVER experienced. INCREDIBLY annoyed, enough to write in to the head office.

I am very disappointed in three McDonalds stores in Surprise Az.   We have visited the bell and 303 location 2 times, and the Walmart @ Waddell rd 2 times and the Grand and. Reems location 1 time,  since Thanksgiving ordered the XBOX promo, and each time I had to ask for XBOX game pieces, they employees did not have the right containers out to play the game.    Early on in the game I guess I understood, but not weeks into the game.  These stores need to be made aware of what is going on and the stores managers and assistant managers need to be more attentive.

REVIEW #14:  1 stars  (1713 chars)
I've eaten at a LOT of McDonalds' in multiple countries but this place is the WORST when it comes to quality. My wife takes the pickles off her burgers and when she recently opened up a southwest chicken sandwich there was what appeared to be LINT on the bottom of it! We were busy that evening, kept it in the fridge to take back, didn't have time the next day and then it obviously didn't matter.. I've bought filet-o-fishes where the tartar sauce is slopped so far on the side of the sandwich that most of it winds up in the box, and a couple of nights ago we gave them one last chance - wife brought back my order of 2 filet-o-fishes and I looked in the bag and asked why they'd given us chicken sandwiches? She checked inside and said they were just the wrong box but the f-o-f's were correct. Fair enough. Then she had another look in the fucking bag and found they'd given her a spicy chicken sandwich instead of a double cheeseburger. WTF? I mean obviously she checks the bag when they pass it into the vehicle window but when you see the correct number of boxes/items in a darkened car interior you assume you're good to go, right? You're not going to check between the damn burger's legs to determine its gender, right? Basically this place SUCKS, the franchise owner has no clue about quality control and we're not eating there again. I'll see if I can find the pic of the lint on the burger that she sent me from her Blackberry. Avoid this place and just get Culvers or Jack in the Box instead. ...  ... Incidentally, this is the first McDonalds in over thirty years that I've had anything near this sort of tragic experience with, which is mainly the reason we went back after we got the lintburger..

REVIEW #15:  1 stars  (304 chars)
Tried the clubhouse burger.  YUCK,  the flavors don't blend, the bun tasted weird, too much sauce that was not complimentary to the sandwich, long story short didn't like.  Gave it a thumbs down to manager, who seemed un interested when I told her that we ate only a third of the sandwiches we purchased.

What can I say! The changes! McDonalds has been around forever! And now they want to change! Just because a few people wants to run our lives!! I get it! You can always make it an option! But no! You have to request fries! or soda! If I want a freakin apple or milk, I'll just eat at home! We come to the golden arches to get away from everyday life. Give me that processed food! That's why we come here for!!! Anyway, this location is like any other place. Good service, at least they try! You have to realize that if these workers were more valuable, they would be working somewhere else! Give these kids a break. We have all been there!

I know a lot people don't like McD's, but this one is actually pretty good.  Every time I have gone there, they get my order correct and pretty good service.  If you have Sun Dollars from ASU you can use them there.  It's cheap food and the parfaits are good for only a buck.  The bathrooms are always clean and they remodeled the inside so it looks really nice.  They even have a waterfall inside.  It's probably the nicest McDonald's in Tempe.

It was time to try the McWrap. All the commercials got to me and it does come in cool packaging. It is like a burrito nest they lay the McWrap inside, but it doesn't look exactly like the commercials portray the thing. Nothing is sticking out of the wrap like fresh cucumbers, etc. It wasn't bad though. It was the sweet-chili version and the chicken strips were grilled and there was some veggies and a  splash of slightly spicy, but sweet sauce. At $4.50, it was only about 375 calories, so if you have no choice and need to eat healthy, the McWrap does the trick.

REVIEW #4:  3 stars  (356 chars)
The usually get stuff wrong, but are quick to fix it. Cater to the drive thru customers so you might have to wait a while if you go in to order. Inside is generally clean,  bathrooms are not the worst. They have catsup and straws and napkins available for self service. There are many different seating options and they're open late inside the dining area.

This location was one of the worst experiences I've had at McDonalds in a while. The location is older and you can tell the lot needs to be repaved. The drive thru was extremely slow. Add to it that the location is really inconvenient, and this made for a poor experience

REVIEW #6:  1 stars  (3700 chars)
Everyone on the planet darn near has visited McDonald's. It's worldly icon and it will probably be the first form of food to be available on the ISS (International Space Station) which I think is only fitting! However there is a problem that "McD's" needs to fix before "they boldly go where no burger has gone before." McD's management at the store level and at the corporate level need to train their employees on how to get an order correct when it comes to what the customer says they want. Now I'm not saying don't up sell apple pies and drinks but the people who work in drive through and in-store need to really listen to the customer and hear what they want!  ...  ... When I go to McD's drive thru or in-store I like to order a "Quarter Pounder" an original "core" sandwich at McD's. The Quarter Pounder was invented in 1971. When I place my order the employee always ask me do I want cheese on it? I say no and they turn and tell the cook "One Quarter Ham" please. Now I have learned over the years of ordering at McD's how to order to get exactly what I want, so I figured I would say what the order taker would say to the cook to get what I wanted. Sounds pretty simple to me...Not so fast! The order taker still ask me if I wanted cheese on my burger. ...  ... So when I return another time and I order my Quarter Pounder I say "may I have a Quarter Ham please" and what does the employee do? Ask me if I want cheese!!! I say no again! Then they turn around and say "One Quarter Ham!" What's up with that? I ask for for a burger in McDonald's employee terminology and the employee disregards the terminology and hears only what they want to hear. ...  ... Then to top things off they want to charge me the same price for a Qtr Ham as a Qtr Ham with cheese which makes no sense to me! So when I inquire about the differences in prices or lack there of, the employees tell me that they must charge me the same price for a "Quarter Ham" as a "Quarter Pounder with Cheese" there is no pricing difference. Why not??? (Considering a regular hamburger cost one price and their regular cheeseburger cost is a little more because of the cheese being added.) By me not adding cheese to my sandwich the employee has to do more keystrokes than the single one touch entry for a Quarter Pounder with cheese! More work= more time in line for the employee and the customer. ...  ... I know I'm crazy for blogging about this but if nothing is said people will not get what they want when they go to McD's and that's not right and I really do enjoy the food there. I have been going since I was a little kid with my father and brother and it was a weekly treat and I have done the same with my son some 30+ years later. What your training your employees to do is not good customer service this is cattle herding!!! The days of customer service have all but dissolved away and as a corporate entity you know this and instead of going back to what got you where you are today you change your own corporate model and do business as usual!!! ...  ... On a side note! if your going to put someone in drive-thru, put someone there who speaks intelligable english. I could barely understand the girl working in the drive-thru and I also speak spanish and when I realised it would be better to talk to her in spanish she dismissed my ability to order in spanish and used English but when I'm in the store (same transaction because something was wrong with my order) I heard someone make their order in spanish and she spoke it back to the customer for the whole transaction! Can a brotha that speaks spanish not be slightly discriminated against because I don't look like I come from a spanish speaking country???

I wish I could give this place 0 stars because 1 star is too generous. Two of the worst experiences I've had at a restaurant have been at this McDonald's in the past two days. Last night the guy told me he was done playing my game and that they didn't have honey when I asked if they seriously didn't have honey and tonight I had to ask the girl to slide my card because she held it in her hand and proceeded to stick her head out the window and tell someone that she could see their light flashing. I get that it's McDonald's but this specific location is awful and will no longer be receiving my business

REVIEW #8:  1 stars  (742 chars)
I've never had a problem with service from the employees or food, as far as McDonald's go that aspect is pretty typical. The problem lays in the terrible people that occupy the lobby for hours on end. This is a place for people to flock with their computers and sit for 8 hours at a time. They leech off of the wi-fi and play their music loudly while they play games. It gets worse when they have breakfast wrappers sitting on their table at 4pm. If you want a seat to enjoy your meal upon, you're out of luck, and the idea of going in groups is directly out of the question unless you want to sit outside by a busy road. Until the management steps up and clears out lobby for the actual customers, i recommend trying the taco bell next door.

One thing about this McDonald's is that the decor has been revamped. It's a very nice McDonalds when you look at everything. However, that's as far as it goes. ...  ... Good thing I'm only coming in for something off the value menu but I say you are better off going somewhere else. Or even a different McDonald's. The one on McClintock and University is nice. Go to that one. ...  ... The service at this one by ASU is pretty lousy. I had a person that couldn't even answer my questions. A manager was there to interpret back to the person at the register. And another time, they couldn't even answer what a certain sandwich contains when they DID speak English. I don't know what these people are doing but it's definitely not their job.

REVIEW #10:  1 stars  (558 chars)
This location has the WORST service I have ever seen. I mean, I know people make mistakes once or twice, but EVERY time I eat here something goes wrong. I've had food not given to me that I paid for, really terribly cooked food, and order mess-ups all at this location in just the past few times I've been here. Come on, really, you work at a FAST FOOD place. How hard can your job be? The only reason I keep returning here is because its right near my apartments but it looks like from now on I'll be going out of my way to go to the location on University.

REVIEW #3:  3 stars  (436 chars)
Have been here for breakfast a few times now and the service always seems to be quick and the always has that same delicious mcdonalds taste...The only thing is sometimes the cashier can be rude and short with the orders. Not every welcoming to 2 orders in the car as well. Also, the hash browns seem to be inconsistent. Either overcooked or a bit undercooked. Uh hello!!!This is the best part about mcdonalds breakfast here people!!!!!

REVIEW #4:  3 stars  (326 chars)
This is a McDonald's, however in the past couple of months they completely remodeled the whole thing, so now it's worse. You'd think with new decor and freshly opened makes it better, it doesn't. it's cold and cramped, and i don't recommend it at all. The staff looks new, but already they need a new over-haul as well. Crazy.

REVIEW #5:  3 stars  (728 chars)
While I am not a frequent McDonalds customer, there are times when I absolutely, positively have to have the fries.  Nothing else will do.  When that need strikes this clean and newly renovated McDonalds location is A-OK! ...  ... Two drive-through lanes make ordering and receiving food quick and easy.  I fortunately have not had the experience of receiving an incorrect order, and have even been able to use coupons in the drive-through without issue.   ...  ... While the food never quite looks as it appears on TV, I have not been to a McDonalds that does meet this standard (except in Tokyo, which made the most beautiful Big Mac I have ever seen... ) So, this will continue to be my go-to spot to satisfy my fry cravings.

REVIEW #6:  2 stars  (287 chars)
About 99% of the time I don't eat fast food. However,  on the weekends we occasionally get egg mcmuffin meals that are pretty tasty.  They certainly are still fast food,  and don't compare to restaurant style food,  but sometimes a lil mcdonalds hits the spot.  I love their hash browns.

REVIEW #7:  2 stars  (2022 chars)
I'm reviewing yet another fast food restaurant and it's not because I'm totally into grease, but because I'm admittedly overly critical of attention to detail in these drive-thru places because hello, you're driving through, usually driving AWAY, and you're too far from the restaurant to remedy the situation when you notice they foul up. I worked at a restaurant with a drive-thru when I was in high school that was run by a tough, whip-wielding family who taught us that you DON'T make mistakes. You just don't. You take steps to ensure that you are not missing anything because no one wants to drive back to bitch when mistakes are made.  ...  ... With that said... not only was a special order acknowledged but not followed through, we received no ketchup (for not one but two orders of french fries), no STRAW for a soda, and they charged me an extra 27 cents for a side of sweet and sour. Which they didn't put in the bag. Now while I realize that these are minor items and to some I may be perceived as a petty crank with too much time on my hands, if this is the way you need to drink your soda while you drive, with a straw, it complicates things. If you like ketchup with your fries and at 99% of every other drive-thru in the country you don't have to ask for it, you're in for an unpleasant surprise. And paying extra for something you don't receive is really dumb.  ...  ... Onto the food...  ... I remember back when I was a young whipper-snapper, that McRib was awesome (as long as you don't lift the bun and look at it, you're golden). While it hasn't shrank like everything else it seems, they now skimp on the sauce in a big way, and let's face it, it's the sauce that makes the sandwich. This sucks: The poor old smooshed-together McRib just isn't that great anymore. Or maybe my cranky, wrinkled-up ornery taste buds have changed. Or maybe I've finally woken up and realized that no one should ever be eating this kind of food, for any reason whatsoever.  ... I'm sure it's a combination of the three.

REVIEW #8:  2 stars  (928 chars)
I've been to this Micky D's a few times and each time I've been here it's been okay...this time, however, I came with a co-worker to get lunch for our boss. They screwed the order up each time they repeated it and gave us two Coke Zeros instead of one Coke Zero and one Dr. Pepper as ordered...even then, my co-worker said the DP tasted flat and nasty.  ...  ... The drive-through people here this time were rather snarky and didn't crack a smile. They had a very rude tone with a straight-faced, pissed expression. I've worked in the food business in the past and that is VERY BAD ETIQUETTE! Not cool, McD's! Get some people who appreciate helping customers and get rid of these ass clowns you  have working for you! These reasons are why my opinion from former visits went from pretty good to downhill and less of star ratings. ...  ... By the way, clowns are CREEPY! Ronald McDonald has ALWAYS creeped me out since childhood!

REVIEW #9:  2 stars  (823 chars)
This place has gone to pots since they have changed over to the new improved look they seem to get my orders wrong every time the food is cold and just doesn't taste like Mcdonalds food. The drive thru menu is hard to read since they changed the background to white and if you go at night prepare yourself for extremely rude employees and just over all bad service. I have been attending this location since humm I was born.. I had my birthday parties there in the 70's and 80's.. now its just not the same.. I really just have to say the food does not taste the same as it did before they changed it over to the new improved look. Although I love the look maybe its the coldness of the employees whom you can tell really don't want to work there but they have too. NEEDS EMPLOYEE Training there on how to be kind and smile

Not only is this a McDonald's so therefore nigh on inedible, but its a bad McDonalds! I have never had food from here that tasted good at all! ...  ... Two pet peeves: They have no bike rack. Y'know how Mickey D's is all, "We are for the active American now, come get yer carrot sticks!" Well, why don't you have a bike rack? Especially in one of the highest bike population densities in the country? Burger King down the block has 'em! ...  ... The other: They have done away with small drinks. The smallest is medium now. THE SMALLEST DRINK IS A MEDIUM. Even better? They still have lids labeled for smalls!

You couldn't screw up my order any more if you tried.  This place is so bad I just pull up to the drive through and I tell them, "I have $15.00 to feed 4 people. Make it happen."  That is the only way I can be sure that they won't give me the wrong thing.

I've been to this McDonald's twice now and the service is fast, friendly, and fantastic!

Slowest.... McDonald's..... Ever.... With two drive-thru you would think that this would go a lot faster. I'm very rational about waiting, but what bothers me the most is a type of customer service. Better training is needed. Otherwise great design.

Go to this McDonalds just cause its next to work.  Service is slow...  everyone seems like they don't want to work there.  Even the supervisor doesn't even want to take orders.  Hashbrown taste like a filot fish.  Even drive-thru takes forever.

REVIEW #4:  1 stars  (398 chars)
I've been to this location 3 different times and ordered 2 double cheeseburgers all 3 times and it was beyond terrible. Cold patties, cheese not melted, carelessly thrown together burgers, fries taste like they have been sitting for days. McDonald's is never expected to be the caviar of food but I would at least expect some sort of quality. If there was an option for 1/2 of a star I would do it.

REVIEW #5:  1 stars  (372 chars)
This McDonalds has very poor service. The employees seemed like they did not want to work there at all. Food sometimes takes quite some time to come out. I go here since it is right next to work and is very close. Other coworkers also complain about this McDonalds not being that great and recommended me to actually go out of my way to a different place to get breakfast.

REVIEW #1:  1 stars  (1330 chars)
Has got to be the worse mcdonalds I have ever been too. I thought all the other reviews were just being mean, but they're right. I walked in at 1:20pm on a Thursday. There was one family waiting for ice cream cones but other than that, no one else was in line or near the counter. I watched as the cashier got the ice cream cones made and handed to the kids and even when she looked at me and I smiled at her, she still did not return the smile or greet me. There was another worker bagging drive thru food and another employee sweeping the floor. All of them looked directly at me. Not one of them greeted.  ... I waited for 10 minutes WITH NO ONE ELSE IN LINE before I finally was asked what I wanted. They were all talking to each other and joking around with the cooks about nonsense.  ... I finally got my drink, the soda was flat, and when I got my food, the buns were stale and the fried were old and cold.  ... The seats were falling apart. The booth I sat in moved every time the teen on the other side of it moved. They then made it a game and continued to move it and laugh about it with their friends. One woman sat in another booth next to mine and the seat nearly collapsed to the ground because of how unstable it was.  ... I was just looking for cheap dollar menu before work but this wasn't even worth the dollar.

REVIEW #2:  1 stars  (780 chars)
I started this review with two stars, but I'm editing it to give it only one. By the time I get to the register it's 10:30 and I am told I can't order breakfast even though I was in line before 10:30. The cashier let me order breakfast anyway - all I want is a McMuffin - and I proceed to wait twenty minutes to even get my order. I might have been able to forgive this considering there were two huge orders ahead of mine (Easter breakfast for the whole family, I guess) except my McMuffin was soggy, and my iced coffee was so stale I couldn't taste the flavored syrup in it. Worst of all, even after I got my food, I still had to wait for my coffee, because they had decided to make coffee for other orders first. You can be sure I will do my very best to never come here again.

REVIEW #3:  1 stars  (375 chars)
They don't have the combo with two sausage egg mcmuffins. I wake up, on Easter, go and think I'll have a delightful fast food breakfast, drive around in an unfamiliar city, finally make it to those golden arches and into the drive thru and what do I get? My dreams crushed. My soul shattered. Needless to say if I'm in Phoenix again I will NOT be coming here for nourishment.

This is McDonald's, you know what to expect and they deliver it consistently. If you're writing a bad review about McDonald's, you may lack self control or are just a cranky person.

This place is brand new!  So you know McDonalds is on it's game for the first year.  The food has been great every time, and the employees there actually have made me laugh a couple of times through the drive through.  They seem very nice and not always... Can I take your oder... I give this place 5 stars as far as mcdonalds go.  I drive a little out of my way to come to this one because I know all their machines are nice, clean and new ^.^

I'm here frequently for coffee since it's close to my kids school. We've had fundraisers here, playdates, etc. Plenty of room. Dining room is remodeled. Video games and a large play structure for the kids. The food is ya know McDonald's, but the employees are friendly and they get my order correct pretty much all the time (they can't seem to grasp light cream on the iced coffee though). Bathrooms are clean. No complaints :)

REVIEW #4:  4 stars  (715 chars)
Mcdonald's food is just way to constant to judge it from location,  so you can really only review the service.   This location is better than many I've been to,  and the ground up rebuild a few month ago makes it one of the more modern Mickey D's arround.   Only thing that keeps this from being a 5 star review was the fact that they don't open at 4:30am.  Now,  I can't nessesarraly fault them for that,  but a few weeks ago I tried to go through the drive through at 4:30am or thereabouts.  ALL the lights  at the drive through and through out the store were on,  so I sat there for a few minutes saying "hello"  before driving off.   Overall,  decent coffee,  good fast food and service. Of course I'll be back!

Usually here for the occasional diet Coke and occasionally an ice cream cone for the dogs, but since sometime around 7:00 a.m. this morning the place is gone -completely demolished.  Now why does that make me all happy and giddy with joy?  I imagine it's simply because it's too much of a temptation. ... Well I don't know this to be a fact but I'm fairly certain they'll be back.

Ive not been inside, so I cant speak for that aspect, but the service and food quality is above average in my opinion for McDonalds. ...  ... Not sure what that other review is all about...

I stopped by this McDonalds yesterday before work. I knew I wanted some nuggets and maybe fries. I got to the window and ordered nuggets. I wanted a second to decide if I wanted the full meal or anything else but the girl in the drive thru rushed me so I decided not to get anything other than the nuggets. I know it's "fast" food and ideally I should come through the drive thru and already know what I want to buy, but I wasn't going to spend more than 2 minutes looking at the menu and deciding. It wasn't even busy, there was no one behind me and this location has two speakers. Even when I went to pay she was in too much of a hurry and practically threw my change at me. I won't go out of my way to come here again. I ended up going to Burger King for a whopper and fries a few hours later. If  the girl at the window had been a little more patient then I probably would have just gotten a full meal and drink from McDonalds. ...  ... 2 Stars because the girl at the second window was nice and the nuggets weren't bad.

I got a bunch of breakfast food and basically the whole order was wrong. There was sausage seeping through the bag and they added 3 things we didn't even order and forgot 2 sandwiches we ordered. The food looked absolutely disgusting. The eggs look like a big pile of thick mustard the sausages were dripping so much with oil it was seeping through the bag. The lady even asked us if we needed extra syrup and hot sauce and she didn't even put them in the bag...wtf? I have two young children who were very disappointed when we couldn't eat the food because it was just disgusting. And when I called them and asked for a manager she answered the phone and said you're speaking to one in a very very rude tone. And then I started telling her what was wrong she said bring it all back and we will redo the order....well no I have two young kids I don't have a car I can't be going back-and-forth it's just not logical for me then she interrupted me and rudely said what what's missing from your order I couldn't even believe how I was being treated so I just hung up the phone I will never go to this McDonald's again and I'll make sure every single person that I know doesn't go to this McDonald's either.

I managed to convince myself to drive the 15 minutes to this Mcdonalds, as it was one of few open at 1 am.  I ordered a coke, drove home (30 min round trip plus wait in line) and discovered to my dismay that I had been given a Dr. Pepper. I hate Dr. Pepper, threw it away.  This is not the first time I have been disappointed in this store.  On several occasions on late night visits they have not been able to accept debit.  Another time I received diet coke.  The next time I feel like a late night snack Im going to Wendys.

This is a good McDonald's in the Tempe area.  They have good customer service and never have gotten my order wrong.  This is a place that usually busy with families (in Playland) and small crowds.  There is a highschool nearby, so i would be careful not to go during thier lunch hour if you dont want to run into crowds.

Correction - wrong location. I was looking for the location at Elliot and McClintock and reviewed this one. Music is still too loud but I am over 60 and I know every song.  ...  ... Somehow complaining about the food quality at a McDonalds seems disingenuous. It is consistent and filling but not expected to be great cuisine. My issue with this location is the rebuild that now caters to a target market that clearly does not include me anymore. All hard uninviting surfaces and loud music. When I asked if they could just turn the music down the manager said he did not know how???  When you build a place that serves cheap food, has loud music and looks like it was designed by  a skate park builder you should not be surprised when you get skaters and teenagers  to come in. ...  ... Staff always seems to be accommodating if not well informed.

Ok, here we go again.  You wash your hands, but they only have those stupid air blowers that take forever to try & dry them, so you go for ass gaskets instead.  There is a dispenser but it's empty, so you spend a while back at the air blower.  Then you go (with your still damp hands) for toilet paper to open the door with, because it has a latch & you'd like to leave the bathroom with you hands cleaner than when you entered!  So far we're at 1 Star     :-O ...  ... The service & food were ok, but I won't return to this McDonalds. ...  ... McRib Combo $4.89, Ice Cream Cone $.79

So, on most weekends, I get stuck working late.  Real late.  Most of the time I need to eat before I get home.  That is when I rely on the 24 hour fast food joints.  As much as I try to avoid them, but with my situation, they do come into play. ...  ... This McDonalds is no better or worse than any other as far as the food is concerned.  Crap.  At that late, I face the reaper and need to admit this and go into it willingly.  But this one is across the street from my house, easy to get to on my drive home.  Driving through at about 3 in the morning, and having to wait for 12 minutes for the car in front of me, here is the transcript of my ordering experience. ...  ... drive thru - "Hello, what can I make for you?" ... Me - "Do you have the 20 piece mcnuggets for five dollars?" ... drive thru - "No sir." ... Me - "Oh, you have a huge promo poster I am looking at that says you do, in front of your store." ... drive thru - "No, sir, it is not 5 dollars, it is $4.99, not 5 dollars." ... Me - "Sure, that sounds good.  I'll have that." ... drive thru - "It is not 5 dollars, it is $4.99." ... Me - "Yeah, that is fine, I'll take one order of those." ... drive thru - "The price is different, you want to order them?" ...  ... At this point, I have been up for over 21 hours, working 2 jobs for about 16 of those.  I'm doing my best not to lose my shit. ...  ... Me - "Yes that is fine." ... drive thru - "Sauce?" ... Me - "Just ketchup." ... drive thru - "No sauce?" ... Me - "Ketchup is fine." ... drive thru - "Something to drink?" ... Me - "No thanks." ... drive thru - "No drink?" ... Me - "No thanks." ... drive thru - "Fries?" ...  ... I don't answer, I drive to the window. ...  ... I get my food and drive home.  For 20 nuggets, there are 4 packets of ketchup.  No napkins.  The roommate, who we will call "Joe," is still up.  I eat 10 nuggets and am done.  I give the rest to said roommate. ...  ... Apparently, the second box of nuggets have been sitting out longer than the first box, and he spits one out on the floor after taking a bite.  My dog happily eats the remains. ...  ... I'm making sandwiches when I get home from now on.

REVIEW #9:  2 stars  (679 chars)
This is a pretty sucky McDonald's.  It was nice to have a McDonald's so close to where I live, but in the time I have been living here, I have experienced at this place: ...  ... --LOOOOONG drive-thru lines that can take 20 minutes or more. ...  ... --egg shell pieces in the McMuffins ...  ... --double charges on my debit card ...  ... The food actually tastes just a bit better than other McDs I've been to, but the issues listed often make it not really worth it.  If it takes you 20 freaking minutes to get your food, it ain't fast--kind of defeats the purpose.  This place is just a facepalm overall and I really can't recommend it.  Maybe you'll be lucky--we haven't been.

Cheap!  Cheap!  Beware!  If you order Chicken McNuggets from this McDonald's they will charge you 10 cents for each sauce packet over the alloted quantity.

She ordered 2 of them for $6.66 and it turned out to be a devil's deal.  They charged her for 4 McMuffins and gave her only TWO.  This isn't the first time I've been shorted a McMuffin here, but it is the first time I came TWO SHORT and I'm getting pretty cheesed off. ...  ... They always give replacements when you go back and speak to the manager, but how about not having this garbage happen in the first place? ...  ... Down to one star.

This is a newer McDonald's, which is designed with a more contemporary feel. There's a large indoor playground for your kids too. Service was quite sluggish though. ...  ... Despite the wait, this will be forever in my memory be the first McDonald's where I tried a shamrock shake (Minty creamy sweet delicious!).

REVIEW #4:  2 stars  (589 chars)
I am amped that this particular site does not include four dipping sauces for a 20 piece, Chicken McNuggets. The only give 3, and you have to pay for the fourth. Any other McDonald's in the area gives you four without asking. This McDonald's is trying to pull a fast one. So I just want everyone to know how dirty I think this is. ...  Ever since I was a kid when we ordered nuggets we got 4 dipping sauces. That 5 nuggets per sauce. They expect me to try and ration almost 7 nuggets per container? That's unacceptable. I guess I will visit the McClintock or the ASU locations from now on.

The past few times I have stopped at this restaurant to use the drive thru; its been backed up to at least 9 cars.  This McDonalds had customers all confused of who was next in line, which unfortunately there was customers trying to cut in from another side of the drive thru. BUT still if McDonalds was having a order that was taking longer then usual, then ask the customers nicely to park to the side so you can move the other cars waiting.  I thought maybe the whole Restaurant was behind but someone parked and went inside to get their food, to come out only 2 minutes later.  Unfortunately I could not do that since I was caught in the middle of the line.  That indicated to me that they were not behind through the whole store, it was just the drive thru that was sucking.  I like this McDonalds, but they need to be aware of their customers outside also. Its unpleasant when you have to deal with other customers trying to act like they been in line the whole time and trying to cut in from a different side of the McDonalds.  Very rude.  Its common knowledge that the mornings and lunch hours are the busiest, put in better procedures or processes to make sure the customer is happy.

This McDonald's is okay. I've been to better ones.  ...  ... My friends and I stopped here for breakfast en route to the NASCAR race. We had to wait a few minutes for their food, which was no big deal, so my friend and I found a table while our other friend used the bathroom. When she came back to the table, the look on her face said it all. She informed us NOT to use the bathroom there unless we use the handicap stall. Why? Because some female had started her monthly problem and left evidence of it IN PLAIN SIGHT on top of the disposal receptacle inside the stall plus the toilet was a mess! The bathroom in general looked as if it hadn't been checked or cleaned in quite some time as well, our friend said.  ...  ... I'm sorry, but any place that doesn't take the time to clean up all parts of their place of business won't be getting my business ever again!

REVIEW #7:  1 stars  (691 chars)
Horrible customer service. And apparently all the employees have a hard time hearing. I asked for my burger without PICKLES or mustard. But I guess the girl heard no onions or mustard. So I brought it back up and I'm going to assume I talked to the shift manager and she said "well it says no onions that's why you didn't get onions". Obviously that's why I didn't get onions. I'm not stupid. But that's not what I had said.  ... I guess pickles and onions sound the same.  ...  ... This location sucks only because the employees are not friendly and they don't listen. Your job isn't that hard. And if you hate it then do something about it. Don't give someone crappy service because of it.

REVIEW #8:  1 stars  (448 chars)
I vow to never step foot into this mcdonald's again.  It is by far, the nastiest McDonald's I have ever visited.   ...  ... We went in today for an after school mcflurry.  The place smelled bad (think vomit) and it was dirty.  The upholstered chairs are in such bad shape that they have been "repaired" with duct tape all along the entire bank of tables.   ...  ... This place gives me the creeps.  So long McDonald's.  I don't think I'll miss you.

REVIEW #9:  1 stars  (1095 chars)
Please note: I realize this is fast food and I am rating it as such. ...  ... This is what I ordered in the drive-thru and in this order:  1 chocolate milk, 1 small orange juice, 1 large vanilla iced coffee, 6 sausage mcmuffins, 1 large coke.   ... Here is the response I got:  1 large french vanilla iced coffee, anything else? ...  ... It took a few tries but she finally got my order right.  When we picked up the food, the coffee had no flavoring.  Albeit, I was mad at the need to go into the restaurant (we used drive-thru for a reason) but when I got in there the manager said she didn't give me flavoring because of how they wrote the ticket.  She was wearing the drive-thru headset!  When I asked who took my order then, she flat out lied to me and said someone else took it.  It's one thing to get crappy service in a fast food restaurant but when the manager has no honesty or integrity at all, they deserve to go out of business.  I really hope the manager above her sees this.  If a manager can't even be honest to a customer about a simple order, what else is she capable of doing?

If you like Mc Donald's food, then this is a very good location. The location is very convenient and has entrances from 2 streets. The parking lot is kind of a pain to navigate but the lot is very clean. The employees at this location are very courteous and seem to be in a better mood than in most Mc Donald's locations. The drive thru here is extremely fast, even though it only has 1 lane going in. Overall, I definitely recommend this location over any of the others in the area. ...  ... Still McDonald's food, though...

REVIEW #2:  2 stars  (1369 chars)
This is the Wal-ly World of fast food places. Everything processed and genetically engineered. There is a reason it tastes exactly the same no matter which one you go to. Scary. ... I have to give them an extra star, per my own rule, because they do serve Coke Zero. The only reason I was even here was they had free food but even for free the price is too high. I am one who doesn't turn down free food but from Micky Ds I just might. ... The restaurant, for lack of a better term, itself is nice. Clean and efficient. Nice staff. But overall it is still a McDonald's. Satan won't even eat here. Nor are there any McDonald's in hell because the Devil thinks it is cruel and unusual punishment. ... On the plus side there are Unicorns in the ball pit and they serve alcohol upstairs but you have to ask nice and know the secret password. ... I will try my best to never go to a McDonald's again but once in a while they have cheap or free Big Macs which might lure me back for a second or two. It is sad that at the mire mention of the word Big Mac I can almost taste one. Ugh. ... I am sure some people like McDonald's and think it is a good value with fast and friendly service. Everyone is entitled to their opinion. In my opinion though with so many other great choices, some a thousand times better, why still go here. Oh well. Evil exists so we know what good is.

REVIEW #3:  1 stars  (247 chars)
If you want to go to a fast food restaurant to be ignored, then this is the place.  The employees go out of there way to ignore anyone who might be in line.  Only when there is a line of 5 people do they slither to the counter.  Horrible business.

Stopped in here this morning for breakfast, joined by Robyn N.  UGH!  I often stop at a McDonald's to eat when I'm out of town, & usually think they're at least 3 Stars, but this one was a real dud today.  To begin with they weren't busy, possibly having as many employees as customers, yet it took us and everyone else a LONG TIME to get our orders from their simple menu!  Not only that, there were no paper towels in the men's bathroom, only those stupid blowers, mounted down near the floor (for 3-year-olds?).  The door opens IN, so how are you supposed to get out of there with your hands clean, wait 'til you can get into a stall to get some toilet paper? ...  ... My breakfast sandwich seemed like it had been sitting around for a long time, too.     :-O ...  ... Sausage McMuffin with Egg $2.69, Sr. Coffee $.79

REVIEW #4:  2 stars  (514 chars)
Super busy location and both times I have been here there is a huge line. It's almost like chaos in the lobby. I don't know if it is because it's a busy locaiton or because they are unorganized. I went inside then thought better and went through the drive thru where there was only one car ahead of me. The drive thru was fast but the prices were super high. $7.75 for a 10 piece McNugget meal. Wow! Won't be going there again. Next time I will either go to the Subway across the street or Taco Bell down the road!

REVIEW #5:  1 stars  (1069 chars)
The ole usual stopoff place to Vegas. I might have to reconsider a new one. Today on the way home I stopped elsewhere. Saturday Morning 6/23/13 I stopped here on the way to Vegas. They remodeled the entrance and the parking lot. One person wrote that it has more parking. Hmmm, to me it seems like they have less now but either way it is not an improvement outside or inside. I walk in and the bathroom is closed (really?) I used the Men's room. A line of women followed me in as the manager begrudgingly stood guard. Who cares. Most places have Coed bathrooms nowadays anyway and I have 5 brothers. lol-- However, a lot of elderly ladies stop here and Mom's with babes. They might not be so happy. No one could even say how long the bathrooms would be closed for.  ...    After the bathroom fiasco, I ordered. The worker was very young and very unknowledgeable over basic things. Finally, the place was so dirty. I was appalled at how disgusting everything was. Ewhhhh! You would think they would keep it nicer since it is such a busy place for Roadtrippper Stopovers.

REVIEW #6:  1 stars  (268 chars)
This is a busy McDonald's.  This is one of the bathroom stopping points for travel between Las Vegas and Phoenix.  This is a subpar McDonald's.  Just ordering a couple simple things like fries and a hamburger for the kids but they messed up the order-incomprehensible.

If we go to Chipotle a little further down, we will hit this on the way back for $1 drinks.  Bargain dinner FTW.  Food is always correct when I order it and all the people that I've encountered there are pleasant. ...  ... I've been inside the restaurant itself once and it's nice & clean.  Most of the time I go through the drive-thru and always receive prompt service.  Easy in/out driveway which is a HUGE plus for me; enter from Eastern, exit onto St. Rose.  Wham, bam, thank you ma'am.

This tasty Bacon Clubhouse Burger had a perfect zing of flavor that popped right after the first bite, and sent my taste buds on a first class trip to party city. As the box says, 'the different ingredients "mingle" on an artisan roll', and they form a flawless blend that puts a smile on your face. I would recommend it to anyone and everyone, as I find it is one of the most scrumptious things on McDonalds menu. They also provided fast, friendly, and accurate customer service. Definitely the best Mcdonalds out there!

Went here with my son this past weekend...haven't been to this location in a while and sure enough nothing has changed.  Seriously, I don't know why I even dare take him to another location...oh I remember why...because this one doesn't have a play area :(.  However, taking him somewhere where he gets the slightest distraction from eating his entire meal makes for an unhappy mommy because he ends up not eating his food. ...  ... This location is CLEAN and NOT attached to a gas station (which I always thought was weird).  They even have fresh flowers on every table.  The drive thru is always busy; however if you go in it will save you time.  The staff are efficient...once you get their attention because they seem to be a bit chatty with one another.  The food was as good as it gets for a fast food joint and especially a McDonalds.  My son got a 4 piece chicken nugget Happy Meal and the fries were fresh from the fryer and was not just sitting under the heat lamp.  They were also not stingy with the BBQ sauce like most places and didn't charge us for an extra one as you only get 1 for a happy meal. ...  ... Will definitely be coming back here again when there's a good toy out...

REVIEW #10:  4 stars  (381 chars)
Ok let's not talk about the food. We all know it's bad for you and evil, whatever. What I like about this particular McDonald's is the face to face drive through!  I love not yelling into a speaker and hoping they heard me correctly. It's so refreshing to just talk to someone face to face. I haven't been here a lot, but I can say I've had no errors in my food - quite impressive.

REVIEW #11:  4 stars  (778 chars)
So reviewing McDonald's is like reviewing America. It's been around a while and everybody has had time to form their own opinion. The thing I will review today is their new oatmeal. I usually hit Starbucks every morning before the gym for coffee and their "perfect oatmeal" as they call it. I like it enough and it's a cheap, healthy, low calorie breakfast. I was curious when Micky D's started pitching their own. I have now tried it a few times at a few different locations and have to admit, it might be better! It's a tad more money and a tad higher in calories but it tastes and looks lie a better product.  ...  ... Next time you are hitting that drive thru for a sausage/bacon/Mcbiscuitmuffin sandwich, try the oatmeal instead and give your body and wallet a small break!

So, very hot day in vegas... well, compared to Mountain View, CA that is... I had some scrap steel I wanted to sell, and had just carried a load to my local recycler... and  I was thirsty.... My wife and I decided to swing by McD to get our favorite Wild Berry Smoothie and went to the drive thru. ...  ... The drive thru at this McD is unusual in that there is actually a live person at a window (they have 3 windows, one to order, one to pay, and one to get food) taking orders. Before I said anything, he's like, "would you like to try our new mango pineapple smoothie?"... I said, "well, I was going to order our favorite, wild berry smoothie.." He says, "the Mango Pinapple is much better.... you can put Baccari's in there and it would make a great frozen drink too"  Sold! ...  ... It was good! The syrupy sweetness of mango with the sweet tang of pineapple was very refreshing on this hot Vegas day... it just might become my new favorite.

Went here after a soccer game for lunch around 1PM and it was crazy in the parking lot making it hard to find a spot.  Once in we placed our order but going to a McDonalds drive through or not I always get pickles and onions when I ask for them not to put any on.  Maybe I speak softly or maybe I am speaking in a different language.  I didn't even go back to get a new one since the line was so long. But, I have to say this location is very clean.  They always have someone cleaning up inside and outside the location.  No kid area but after a great game of soccer my daughter just needed to worry about her lunch.  We would go back again and maybe I will just order something else that doesn't have onions or pickles say a salad which would be good for my hips.

REVIEW #14:  3 stars  (266 chars)
Does McDonald's really need a review? ...  ... It's hot outside, so it's a perfect place to grab a cheap drink. I also like their McCafe coffees. ...  ... Food obviously less than mediocre, but we all love the dollar menu. ...  ... Line was horrendous around 1:00pm.

What can I say about good ol' McDonalds. ...  ... Morning & Late night orderings lines do get pretty long.  Especially since its near the freeway so it gets pretty hectic.  ...  ... Had there big breakfast & oatmeal several times and the oatmeal is pretty dry! I wish they put a little more milk or something in there. ... Also, i tried the dipped cone & was not good.  ...  ... But McDonalds fries are never a disappointment :)

REVIEW #18:  2 stars  (449 chars)
It's McDonalds that should say a lot. I really don't like the way their drive thru works... Why cant I just order at the board? It would be so much easier if you had the menu in front of you to double check what the guy at the window is saying... It's not like they were going to getting right anyway. I do give McD's credit for having great ice cream! I don't know why but I have always loved their cones... It's really the only edible thing there.

REVIEW #19:  1 stars  (1305 chars)
We frequent McDonalds quite often with a little 5 year old.  I didn't notice this location had the f-t-f service so I am sitting waiting for someone to say "May I take Your Order?" - just a friendly honk from behind me to nudge me away.  The gal at the 1st window was very nice so that is for the one star rating I gave this location.  I get to the window and the gal doesn't even greet me and gives me the wrong item.  I ordered a milkshake WITHOUT whipcream.  The order was correct but she made it incorrectly.  For some reason I throw up by having this so I see her through the window off to the side taking off the whip cream.  She comes back to the window and I told her that I saw what she did and that I can't have it or I will end up across the street in ER.  She still doesn't say anything and goes to make another milkshake and gives me the milkshake without saying sorry or thank you for coming to McDonalds.  Aghhhh.  My big pet-peeve with ALL the McDonalds they NEVER give nor offer ketchup when you get fries and once again this happened.  If you are going to offer friendly face to face service please live up to that.  I hated this location and the grumpy girl - get a new job girl or a new attitude.  With so many people out of work McDonalds could have hired a friendly person.  Geeeeeez

Normally, I try to stay away from fast-food in general and McDonald's specifically. However, whenever I have a craving for McDonald's, this particular location is my favorite. They do brisk business so all my meals were hot and fresh. Inside the restaurant is cleaner than most other stores and the staff have been mostly friendly and helpful. You should expect a wait in the drive-through, but that just means your order will most likely be just-made and hot (think fries).

As far as mcdonalds go, this one is one of the better ones. I come here a lot - 27 check ins so far! Ive never had bad service here that i can recall. The management must be doing something right! Kudos to you guys! Plus the kids LOVE the indoor play area here. Its big, accessible, and closed off so my kids arent as tempted to run off.

Wow. I cant believe that I haven't written a review for this place. ...  ... It's almost always busy. Morning, afternoon,night, there's cars in the drive thru. ...  ... The staff is always kind. Most fast food places looks like everyone who works there hates their lives. ...  ...  Sometimes the guys on the late shift dance around for you.... Real positive energy! My order has never been wrong, or incomplete here, either. ...  ... If the food isn't "classy" or "healthy" enough for you, don't eat here. I like shopping organic, and what not, but anything in little doses will not hurt you.

I pretty much only come here to treat my son.  So I took my son here because he loves to play in the kids playground area which is pretty neat for youngsters.  The food just isn't what I used to think when I was younger.  The fries are generally pretty good, unless you get served some cold fries which is disgusting.  I had the double quarter w/cheese + bacon.  It was pretty good, but the burgers are not served HOT like many other fast food places.  I would like to see the cheese melted to my bun from the heat.  Service was pretty much exactly what I would expect, nothing too great, but nothing to complain about either.

I walked in for a coffee today. I was looking a little more scrubby than normal and figured that the normal patrons and staff of McDonalds might be a little more understanding than a coffee house. I ordered a single iced coffee, paid, and waited at a table opposite the registers. At the time I was the only one there, but shortly after about 10 people got in line. I waited. And waited. And waited. No coffee? I thought that maybe they'd just needed to get their drive customers out of the way before moving on to my ticket. But people after me started receiving their food. 15 minuted after ordering a SINGLE COFFEE I waited through line and handed my receipt to the cashier. She said they must have skipped me and went to give the ladies my ticket by hand. Another 5 minutes later I had my coffee and was on my way. Sorry, McDonalds, I am not interested in waiting 20 minutes for a coffee.

Not impressed with this Walmart McDonalds. As the cashier told the two customers that asked for a Frape Caramel, "This is the only location that doesn't have Frape Caramels (not sure about that )." The tables were also dirty (felt consciousness about taking a picture with the customer there). With an In & Out Burger in the parking lot, I would have to be craving a Big Mac or not want to deal with a walk in hot temperatures to eat anything more than $5 here.

Since when do they put cheese in a Filet O' Fish sandwich?  It's been awhile since I ate at this franchise. Haven't set foot and bought a meal here in a while, but I was feeling lightheaded when shopping and I ended up here because it was the nearest place to get a bite to eat.   ...  ... Staff was pleasant. It was near closing, no line, 3 employees handled my order. So I got my order remarkably fast. Which made me wonder how long was my food under those warmers. Well I was just about to find out! ...    ... Opened up my sandwich and I kid you not, there was a slice of dried up cheddar cheese in the the filet fish sandwich...ewwww...(see pic) I didn't want to bother remaking it, so I just picked it off.  Then I took a bite. Yup under the heat lamps for too long alright.  The sandwich was way too dry.  The bun wasn't stale at least.  Only got in two little bites and I was done.   The fries were the saving grace though.  It was hot and crisp, so I had a few of those till I wasn't dizzy no more and chucked the rest of my meal.   ...  ... At the time of my visit near closing, the tables were clean, the soda fountain area was not maintained though. Ice cubes and melted ice all over the place.  The trash bins were full. One of them had trash bulging out of it..gross. ...   ... The prices on Mickey D's so not worth the $6 I paid. I can go across the street and get a cooked to order meal that isn't loaded with sodium and preservatives over at the Filipino restaurant for the same price! So I'd skip this place unless you are in desperate need to eat.

Update: the remodel makes this fast food place a much hipper experience. The play area is the same but theres a different seating setup. They also have tvs now. 4 stars.

REVIEW #6:  4 stars  (519 chars)
Yay oh Yay oh Yay!!! ...  ... I usually don't go to fast food restaurants; okay,,, I rarely go eat at a fast food joint.  However, with the breaking news that the McRib is back!!!  I had to go.  I have no idea why they only sell this once a year for only like 5-6 weeks!  Why oh why!??? ...  ... My wife thought I was crazy, but I went and bought 8 of these puppies last night.... gave her one, I devoured two, and stuck the other 5 in the fridge for tomorrow's delight. ...  ... I guess I am one sick person... LOL....

REVIEW #7:  3 stars  (534 chars)
It's a McDonalds, so I'm sure everyone knows what to expect here. They try to get you through as fast as they can with not much in the way of smiles or true customer service. I wish my kids didn't love Happy Meals so much, then I'd probably never eat here. But since they do, I'll snack on a Grilled Chicken Sandwich or just grab a Caramel Frappe. I have to say, this location seems to be consistently fast. The lines can really wrap around the building here, but I've never had to wait long at all. I like that, so three stars it is!

REVIEW #8:  3 stars  (285 chars)
This location was remodeled, the most significant change is the drive thru (at least for me, since I only order through drive thru now). It now has two lanes, which from my experience, surprisingly has quick service. Besides that, nothing significantly different from other Mickey D's.

REVIEW #9:  2 stars  (736 chars)
If you have an option to go to a different Mc Ds, do it, I have given this location several "tries". A few months back Mc Ds as a whole changed the amount of syrup they put in the iced coffees...ok, so I now ALWAYS order extra syrup which they charge me $.50 for at this location (most other coffee places don't do this) ok, charge me $.50 BUT if you do then you may actually want to give me what I've PAID for. I've made a habit when I go here to check, today I made the mistake not to because I was in a hurry & guess what, no extra syrup. This has happened more times than not. I will go out of my way to get my iced coffee w/ extra syrup at another location where they only charge $.30 & they get my order right more often than not.

REVIEW #10:  2 stars  (337 chars)
It got remodeled so it looks nice. Too bad I can't say the same about the drive thru staff. I swear, they are always in such a rush that they screw up your order 70% of the time. It's annoying to repeat your order three times and they still screw it up. Can you guys slow the heck down enough to actually listen and pay attention please?

REVIEW #11:  1 stars  (467 chars)
They are extra slow Yeah yeah this location is a pretty little Mc Donalds that's just extra slow. The service is omg why did I come here slow. Don't get in the drive thru its like a death trap because once your in line your just trapped with no way out no matter what. (Your order will NEVER EVER be correct.) Can I have a cheese burger? Well, when you open ya bag you will have chicken nuggets.  I wish I could give them a big fat zero just no stars at all ....NOPE.

Good location, s-l-o-w service.  Funny crew, on a trip through the drive thru, the cutie taking my order for a Happy Meal, asked if I would like a girl or a boy toy?, I excitedly answered "Oh!, I'll take a Boytoy!", he must of thought I was a dirty old lady, he'd be half right!

REVIEW #2:  3 stars  (280 chars)
It's a typical Mcdonald's with a play area that's great for kids to run around and burn off some energy.  It hasn't been renovated like many other Mcdonalds around town but I'm sure it will be done sooner rather than later.  Food was exactly what we ordered and was hot and tasty.

REVIEW #3:  2 stars  (434 chars)
McDonald's will be McDonald's so I've based my review on service alone. cashier had no personality. He didn't smile or even was interested on working. He looked and sounded miserable taking my order. The manager on the other hand gave me my food with a smile and even cracked a joke. it was a morning shift so that employee needs to cheer up and smile more and spread positive vibes especially when people are just starting their day.

REVIEW #4:  1 stars  (1002 chars)
Horrible !!!!  The teenagers who work here are more interested in socializing than serving customers.  I have been coming to this location for over a year because it is close to my house , but must say I will drive a little further now just so my order will be correct !  I dont understand ????? Are suburb teenagers IQ's going so far down that they cant get even master a cheeseburger fries and drink order?   I get excellent correct orders at Maryland pkwy and trop location on my way to work!!!!  I challenge the owner if this location to order  a meal here and I would be beyond shocked if it is hot and correct!  One example: i ordered a cone a diet coke and 2 coffee.  They give me 2 coffee.  I say " my cone?"  He looks at the big bright screen with the order and  says " oh ya ".  Gives me my cone.   Then a few seconds pass.  " my diet coke ?"  Once again another long hard look at the screen followed by a puzzled look and another " uggggghh oh ya".  Need I say more.  Go somewhere else !!!!!

REVIEW #5:  1 stars  (506 chars)
I am only giving this location one star, because you can't give zero stars. This location can't get anything right. First, my order is wrong or incomplete 7 out of 10 times. Second, the food comes out cold or the fries will not be salted often. Third, a manager/shift supervisor was extremely rude to me simply because I went through the drive thru w/ two separate orders. Fourth, if you want ice cream it's a crap shoot. You never know if the machine will work. TERRIBLE! Worst McDonalds on the planet!!!!

REVIEW #6:  1 stars  (122 chars)
I stopped coming to this location because they NEVER give you napkins in the drive-thru..employees here are pretty grumpy.

REVIEW #7:  1 stars  (1357 chars)
I usually do not care to write reviews for fast food chains, but this was the strangest experience we have had in a drive thru in a long time.  When we pulled up to the first menu, we did not see a window so we glanced at the menu and pulled forward to the next menu where the intercom usually is located.  We did not see one and another car was already behind us.  We went around the building thinking that we missed it at the first menu only to find that located at the second menu was a big unlit sign stating that it was "personal face-to-face service" and we were to order at the window...really???  We pulled up to the first window and no one was there and neither was there a sign stating to move forward to the next window.  We took the risk and pulled forward.  A few seconds later a lady wearing the supervisor uniform took our order while giving another employee a hug and having a conversation with another employee.  Then we saw the car behind us paying for and placing their order at the first window!  Then the lady who took our order came back with our food and was trying to give us some change when she realized it belonged to the car behind us.  The food was cold and old...very confusing and horrible experience at what should have been just a simple drive thru service.  I am not surprised by the low ratings this location has received.

REVIEW #8:  1 stars  (583 chars)
If I could give this McDonald's a negative star I would!  Absolute worst McDonald's I have ever been to.  They NEVER get your order right.  The kids taking your order are usually texting or on their cell phones while you are trying to order.  The fry containers are always half empty.  They ALWAYS have a hand written sign hanging up on the drive thru that explains what they are out of.  One time it was hamburger patties!  We live around the corner but choose to drive an extra 5 minutes and go to any McDonald's that is not owned by the Lipscomb & Smith franchisee. Terrible....F!

REVIEW #9:  1 stars  (544 chars)
If they had no stars available i would give them no stars- the management has failed to train their staff properly or the kids they hire are just dumb and lazy- either way i have contemplated working there as a manager just to overhaul the staff. I have yet to have gone through the drive thru and get what i ordered. The poor reviews should be a wake up call to this mcdonalds manager and owner- get a clue! I will no longer be visiting this mcdonalds and i hope this review along with all the other 1 stars help dissuade any future customers.

REVIEW #10:  1 stars  (728 chars)
McDonald's usually is good for an inexpensive, decent quick bite when you've been drinking. However, I hate clarifying 2 times that I'm ordering an unsweetened iced tea and receive a disgustingly saccharine sweet tea. I mean, this location is one that you order face-to-face through drive-thru!   ...  ... Here's the conversation:  "I'd like an unsweetened iced tea," I pronounced.  ...  ... "sweetened or unsweetened?" asked the careful listener.  ...  ... "unsweetened," I replied.  ...  ... You know the rest of the story... ...  ... Oh, and the southern style chicken hockey puck was both dry and burnt.  ...  ... This McDonald's receives 1 star because they were able to make a usual shitty dining experience even shittier.

REVIEW #11:  1 stars  (377 chars)
This McDonalds is absolutely awful.  It always seems like it is never open, its not open 24 hours like most locations, and the service is very horrible and slow.  The line is always long and as said, the place is so slow.  Their quality for a bacon egg and cheese biscuit is very low.  The best location is Pecos and Bonanza.  This one Valle Verde and Paseo Verde is the worst.

REVIEW #12:  1 stars  (1033 chars)
Walked into this place for the first time to get an ice cream cone while my wife shopped at nearby pet store. The older lady wearing glasses behind the counter asked me if I wanted it To-Go, "To-Go" ? it's an ice cream cone. Anyway I said To-Go, this lady then gave me the biggest Yarn as she handed me my change, then I watched her drop some kind of plastic cup on to the floor, but didn't pick it up right away. She looked like she didn't want to be there at all. i watched her prepare my ice cream cone, then she decided to pickup that cup she dropped on the floor earlier, what gets me is the way she picked it up, looked like as if she was picking up a 400 lbs weight at the gym. Then, as she was handing me my ice cream she says to me "Welcome", "Welcome" for What?  I haven't said my Thank You yet !,  as if she was doing me a big favor.  I grewup in Japan where a customer service is probably the best in the world so maybe I'm little too critical. But I do know one thing, if this was a McDonalds in Japan, she be so Fired !

REVIEW #13:  1 stars  (639 chars)
We should have read reveiws first! I'm amazed that one store in a chain can be so consistently terrible. We have now had our order screwed up three times in a row- that's three for three. We have an endlessly growing tab of free stuff from every time we have called to complain abour our order being wrong.  The last time we got home with the incorrect order it was actually the store manager who completely screwed our stuff up! If you are going to bother hitting this restaurant against all recommmendation that you do not, , make SURE before you leave that the incompetent workers haven't botched your food!  I GUARENTEE that they have.

REVIEW #14:  1 stars  (426 chars)
Why do I keep falling into this hellhole?! ... 4 times, yes, 4, the most I chances I have given a place...either they: ... a) Are out of whatever you want. ... b) Have bad attitudes. ... c) Give you cold food. ... d) Give you melted down frozen strawberry lemonade that looks like puke, I should have taken a picture so that you would know I am not making it up. ... I am going to yell now, ready? STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!!!

REVIEW #15:  1 stars  (207 chars)

Yes!  It finally happened with drive thru.  Ok, I just got a mocha frap drink but the kid was so excited since the driver in front of me looked like Rachel Ray I got a smile and I got a really good drink.  I even got a straw too!  I have to give them a thumbs up!  I have to say I love the drink and please don't tell my friends at Starbucks but I like it better than the Mocha Frap there.....shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!  plz don't tell!  :)

REVIEW #5:  3 stars  (1041 chars)
I used to live on this side of town and would come here once in awhile. Back then, the service was alright. I had to wait once in awhile at the front because the drive through was backed up. And they would get my order right. Today, when I stopped for a quick bite to eat before class, I went through the drive through and was surprised that the line wasn't too crazy. I ordered a McDouble, no pickles, medium french fries and a large sweet tea. Paid & got my food - awesome quickness. BUT when I got to school and started to eat - my cheese burger had pickles. Not only did it have pickles, it had the receipt that said "(1) McDouble; NO pickles." And my sweet tea was watered down and not so sweet, more like bland. Also, my french fries was thrown in the bag & practically poured out of the little holder. ... Really McDonald's? We're going to lower our food services because we have an updated drive through terminal? Just because I go through drive through, does not mean you RUSH me through. I like my food to be made to order. Thanks.

REVIEW #6:  3 stars  (285 chars)
This Mcdonalds has drastically improved since they put in the new drive-thru system.  I used to have to pull around front everyday and wait extra time for food or coffee. ... The only real issue I have is that their specialty coffee is never consistent.  It tastes different everytime!

REVIEW #7:  2 stars  (404 chars)
I just came back from here. The drive thru was crazy, of course because of the time (1130).  ...  ... There was a young employee setting up an umbrella and a sign. He was the ONLY one who was nice, which you would think, in this heat, he would be a little snappy. ...  ... The other two employees I greeted, said "hello" to, asked them how they were. No response. ...  ... Unreal. But my order was right.

REVIEW #8:  1 stars  (236 chars)

Wanted to use drive-thru but saw there was 10 cars in line so I opted to go inside where the line was just as long.  I was inside for over 20 minutes waiting for my order.  They didn't plan for the rush and there were no fries ready.  Also, when the girl poured the milkshake into the cup she got milkshake all over the cup.   If I didn't ask her to clean it she would have given it to me like that.  There was only one person on cash registers and the staff helping him were not giving the cups for the soda.  Also, they ran out of Caeser dressing packets for the salads too.  The genlemen at the cash register was very nice but the supervisor was rude.  I only like coming her because my daughter likes McDonalds.  I do like the location in Henderson that has the space ship play structure, better location and better customer service.

Why do I go here - because it is the closest to my home.  Why bother here anymore.  Running late from work picked up the family and we came thorugh drive-through around 6:30PM with NO ONE else in line in Drive through.  The F-T-F service we were stuck with some one new learning the cash register (I am patient - everyone needs to learn)  I can hear throught the window the employees goofing off singing and laughing really loud and no one helping this cashier out.  Three of us ordered.  Out of three only my daughter's happy meal order was correct.  I asked for no mayo they gave it to me, my husband asked for no pickles and they gave it to him and I wanted a large chocolate milkshake and they gave me a medium.  I even said I ordered a large and the girls response was "well, it says medium".  She gives me the drinks first WITHOUT straws and gives me the bag of food WITHOUT ketchup.  I ask is the straws in the bag her response "I don't know I don't bag them I just hand them to you" - I look at her and say "Well, can I get straws?"  And then the same question about the ketchup "Well, can I get ketchup?"  When we got home and the order was incorrect I was pissed.  I really think they didn't want to make a fresh order and knew that we would be forced to eat it since it was ordered through drive through.  What is up with promoting F-T-F service - Everything about this locations sucks!  I think it is time for us to get healthy and go to Tropical Smoothie which has healthy items and for kids too.

REVIEW #14:  1 stars  (440 chars)
You guys are all going - Why does she continue to go there?  Well it is all about the toy in a kid's meal - come on people.  No straws, No Napkins and No ketchup through drive thru?  Huh?  Just don't get it.  I love their Mocha Frap drink and so do my hips but I wish the corporate headquarters would send their own spies to see how much the drive-thru service sucks.  I do continue to go here because I have a 5 year old!  That is why!  :)

REVIEW #1:  5 stars  (1558 chars)
I am assuming this is the McDonalds that is located in the Plaza Hotel and Casino. If so, I would like to paste a snippet of my review of the Plaza here and say again, the service at this McDonald's is SUPERB:  ...  ... One other thing that really has nothing to do with the Plaza but wanted to mention. One day I was in line at McDonald's to get an iced tea. There was a man in front of me and then a man in a wheelchair being waited on. He looked to be pretty down and out (something you see whether downtown or on the strip) and was ordering some breakfast. I  heard the cashier say $4 something and I saw him put a dollar on the counter...I thought, uh-oh, she'll have to tell him not enough and wonder how he'll react,....well, he had put up a bunch of change and then I though the cashier would get ticked about having to count it all. I was so very wrong...she was so kind and so patient...counted it out and then told him he needed a few cents more so he gave her a dime and then she said, now I owe you a penny...with a big smile on her face. I am sad to say that her behavior just shocked me....I am so used to everyone being rushed and treated rudely...it has become so commonplace...as though we have to pay to be treated like decent human beings...and here this man paid for his coffee and food with change and was treated with extreme patience and kindness. It just really made me so happy and was one of the highlights of my stay in Vegas. I went to that McDonald's several times during my stay and the service was excellent every single time.

REVIEW #2:  4 stars  (681 chars)
I came here last June when I visited the historical Fremont St. for the first time. Can't really remember the service but it definitely wasn't bad for the amount of customers there. ...  ... I guess you can't really complaint though, it is Vegas after all and it's right at the entrance of a god damn casino. ...  ... But I think me and my Dad ordered some type of burgers and then came back when we got a coupon for a free new smoothie thing they had that came with our large soda. ...  ... The smoothie was excellent and I would definitely order another one some time. ...  ... But the only reason for this Mickey D's getting 1 star off, is simply because of the crowd/rowdiness.

Food Poisoning being served at the McDonalds here.  When I called to notify them, the manager at McD's tried to tell me that they would be more than  happy to offer me anything else I wanted to eat.  ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?!? You really think I want to eat your food again??

REVIEW #5:  1 stars  (399 chars)
It's McDonalds. I'm going to assume we all have a handle on the food quality. But you go there for fast food. I mean, they practically invented the space. So if you want McDonalds and you want to eat at the Plaza, head to the one at the D hotel, order out and bring it back. You'll save yourself about 20 minutes of aimlessly loitering in the Plaza lobby. It's happened to me twice now. Never again.

Why would anyone go to this place, when there are a literally a million other places to go? Why would anyone bother to write a review? Whats there to review? The card board tasting imitation beef? or the reconstituted chicken packed in to what they call a nugget or is it that you love your food to have a sir name; mac muffin, mac nuggets, mac ribs, mac chicken how about mac caca or mac poo poo.  Enjoy.

Yuck.  Service and food both deplorable.  ...  ... How do you make McDonalds worse than it already is?  Shove it inside a low budget casino and employ nothing but hood rats.   ...  ... the one star is for it being cheap and quick when hammered inside the Plaza.  At that point diarrhea really isn't a beg deal.

Cause of that heaven sent dollar menu. Love hate relationship guys. ...  ... Updates: They've got smoothies, & I love me some Mango Pineapple. Yum! :D ...  ...

REVIEW #3:  3 stars  (1787 chars)
About as average as your local McDonald's can be.  This one is right up middle alley, not great but not spectacular either.  I just find it surprising the skinny-richie-constant work-outie people up here in Summerlin keep this place busy!  I mean literally not even a block away is Lifetime Fitness!  That place is hardcore. ...  ... Food = OK.  Service = OK.  Fast and efficient as a colonoscopy.  Really nothing of greatness at this McDonald's.  Really run of the mill.  We often visit this location if we are staying in the nearby Red Rock Casino.  Although I would suppose this location stays steadily busy is in part because of the tourists that stay at the Red Rock as well and want cheap eats while on vacation.  Gotta make up for all those lost wages! ...  ... Newest thing at McDonald's is their health-conscious Egg White 'Delight' McMuffin.  Definitely a healthier take on their breakfast menu.  And yes, I fell for that damn $1 coupon conveniently stuck to my McDonald's bag and tried one.  Myself being a bit of a health nut can't complain.  This egg white creation is pretty tasty.  Grilled egg whites, Canadian bacon (eh?), and white cheddar all on a toasted English muffin?  All for only 250 calories?  Yeah for a dollar I really liked it.  But at the regular price of almost $3?  I would have probably passed.  With coupon for $1 and a $1 coffee it made for a nice meal on the small scale of economy.  I almost, ALMOST, added a $1 hash brown.  Luckily I passed and decided to save my money & calories for later. ...  ... Other than that, I think majority of people around the world know what McDonald's offers on their menu.  If you don't, dang, you must be living under a rock?  Or possibly a place where there is no McDonald's within your vicinity (like under a rock).

After yet another night of insane Vegas partying - and enjoying alcohol a-flowin' - we got the munchies. Where did we decide to go? When it's late and you want something cheap and easy (insert favorite jokes here), very little tops fast food. ...  ... We drove to a random McDonald's with a KFC next door - FYI, there are a LOT of them between the Strip and Red Rock (our hotel). At the drive-thru, we placed an order for large fries and 20 Chicken McNuggets. ...  ... When we went to get our food, we were told they were out of large fries - how does that happen??? - and were given hash browns as a substitute. Since it was between three and four in the morning, we didn't press the issue. ...  ... Anyway, the McNuggets were piping hot, fed us, and I have no idea what happened to those hash browns. What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas, right?

REVIEW #5:  3 stars  (658 chars)
I must say that I had a smoothie here when they came out months ago and they are horrible and way too sweet. Sonic has better ones and McD's obviously doesn't use real fruit. Even at midnight, this is not the best sweet tooth option. Wait, there is a positive. Using my 2-1 coupon, I tried the new Strawberry Frozen Lemonade and yes like the commercials indicate it is tart and sweet. These would be a better option to cool you down at $1.59 for a small. The strawberry syrup at the bottom might be the same they use on sundaes, but who knows for sure. McDonald's comes out with new stuff every month, but in the beverage department, frozen lemonade is king.

I've been through in on a number of occasions and have never had a problem. ...  ... Food is typical Mcdonalds and it's always hot so nothing to complain about here.

I'm not friendly myself in the morning LOL     So as long as my order arrives promptly and they don't talk much and my coffee is hot  I'm good with it.

My least favorite fast food place but my daughter's favorite so we make the appearance every now and then.  McDonalds has the best kids meals and playplaces so for my seven year old this is a great place.  Love the apple slices and much smaller fry bags for the kids.The sundays are good and the recently added smoothies are great.  Very disappointed in the new popcorn style chicken. It is worse than KFC's popcorn chicken was before they made larger pieces.  In fact, most of my box was just fried coating with little or no chicken.    As fast food places go, I find McDonalds the most consistent in quality and taste.  I love their breakfasts and the chicken nuggets are still the best.  Avoid the angus burgers.  They are not as good as advertized.

REVIEW #9:  3 stars  (339 chars)
This is the 2nd closest McDs to my house. The closest one is so inconsistent that I come to this one more often. The drive thru can be long  and they often run out of cinnamon melts but the food is at least the way I ordered it and hot when I get it. The inside is clean and a mad house during breakfast time. All in all a decent location.

Yes...it has come to this.  I only feel compelled to write this review because I work nearby, and I visit this McDonalds at least once a week.  I admit, I am a Dollar Menu addict.

Anyway, the set up of the drive through makes for a real pain during peak lunchtime hours. This McDonalds is situated in a busy shopping center, right next to a Starbucks, Del Taco, Albertsons, Bank of America, and other shops. Things get rather congested and hard to maneuver.  However, as McDonalds goes, it is fine. The service is usually friendly and prompt (although the new guy they have in the drive thru is a *tad* too chatty!), and they haven't messed up my order.  Freshness and hotness varies, however.

Maybe it's just me, but it seems like the staff at this location isn't all that friendly.

REVIEW #12:  2 stars  (240 chars)
Micky D's should all be the same, but this one in the 10 plus year I've been going there has about the most stand offish unfriendly people ever. It starts from the top so I guess the owners just don't care if there employees are unfriendly.

Be careful!  I ordered an iced drink @ the drive thru.  The guy @ the second window never said hi or thanks.  I thought my drink was just wet on the outside.   Within minutes my  plastic cup was sticky.  By the time I got home my hands were sticky as well as my steering wheel, shifter, window controls.  It was a lot of work getting myself & the car cleaned.   ... I called the local office.  All she said was that she was sorry & she would tell them to wipe off the glasses.  She did not offer to have a manager call me &/or send me a gift card. ... I emailed corporate.  All I have received is a form email  back.  It's been 5 days.  I think I will stick w/iced-tea lemonades @ Coffee Beans & Tea Leaves.  Bye MacDonald's!

REVIEW #14:  1 stars  (515 chars)
Came to this McDonald's Friday, 7/5/13, forgot to check in though, lol!!  ...  ... Anyways, McDonalds is suppose to be a family joint right?!, especially when they have the playland, well how is it that this place, knowing people come with kids off all ages, NOT have a changing table in the restroom???? Unbelievable!!  ...  ... I will say though at least this place is clean and nice but what I dont like is that they dont have a ketchup dispenser they just have ketchup packets, I personally don't like that all.

REVIEW #15:  1 stars  (331 chars)
Seriously, this probably was the least friendly McDonald's ever.  Other than asking for our order, which was 3 coffees, they didn't say anything to us when we went to the drive-thru window or when we picked up the coffees.  Not one word.  We said thank you at each window. ...  ... Will not go back to this McDonald's for anything.

REVIEW #16:  1 stars  (620 chars)
They didn't even deserve the 1 star I gave them. We went to this McDonalds and ordered some food. The food was good but I had some power tripping Mgr. Tell me and my son that we couldn't fill my Starbucks cup up with water....when I asked why she said because of cross contamination.....( now keep in mind this is a self service soda  machine) so that argument doesn't really fly since everybody using the machine is cross contaminating it.  This women poked my hand out of the way.....I'm like really women.....I left....and she says in a sarcastic tone....God bless you....I'm like he already has.... Get a life women!

REVIEW #17:  1 stars  (591 chars)
This is the worst McDonald's I have ever been to by far. I cannot think of enough bad things to say about their service. ... The Food is standard McDonald's fair, but, they did not give us our drinks with creamer, our order was wrong, the food oatmeal came without enough spoons for the orders count, we had to go back 3 times for all sorts of condiments, and they dish em out reservedly like their lives depend on it. ... They do not seem to understand foreign accents and this is Las Vegas, seriously, if you are going to run a shop in a tourist town, you might as well be prepared for it.

I truly never thought that I would write a review about a McDonalds but I guess I am. I hate to say this but you ALWAYS need to check your bags for your food, this goes with every fast food restaurant. This particular location has done an amazing job at really stepping up their game to ensure that they are getting orders right.

How does one go about writing a review for McDonalds?  They are everywhere!  So I've prepared a brief thank you letter for Ronald and the gang.   ...  ... Dear McDonald's Restaurants,   ...  ... Thank you for having a value menu.  I appreciate that I can order not one but two hamburgers, french fries, and cherry pies for about $4.  Thank you for saving me some money on the days where I only have a few bucks in my wallet.  Thank you inventing the covenanted sausage McMuffin with egg.  You truly are a delicious treat in the morning when I need to put something in my belly to start my day.  Thank you for making your hash browns, a hand held oval replica of you famous french fries.  Thank you for inventing a rib sandwich that only resembles a cartoon version of ribs.  Your tangy bar b que sauce, and the sparse toppings of onions wrapped up in your sesame seed bun is always a treat as you make your appearance for a few weeks each year.  Thank you for being available 24 hours to present your inexpensive delights to me at all hours of the night.  You never disappoint with my low expectations when I dine at you restaurants in Las Vegas and around the world.    ...  ... Sincerely,  ...  ... Ernesto R.   ...  ... Cheers!

REVIEW #4:  3 stars  (423 chars)
This is just a standard Vegas 24hr McDonald's which is attached to a Chevron that is the closest one to where I live. Always relatively clean and trash is taken out when I'm here. Breakfast, lunch and graveyard menu are up to standard which I'd expect from a $4-8 menu (ordering fries, spicy McChicken and McDoubles from the dollar menu and McNuggets). I finally had those Mighty Wings and they were pretty large and tasty!

Checking out the drive thur after reading all the 1 star reviews......let's see how they do.......everything is in the bag, fresh hot fries even!! Will check the rest of the food once we get home.........and FAIL!!!!! The Chicken Bacon Ranch Hot & spicy was missing both the bacon & the ranch!!!! Ordered 4 cheeseburgers, all 4 were old and cold as well as the 6 piece chicken nuggets...old and cold.  Way to Mc Ds, keeping up with the 1 star reviews.

REVIEW #7:  1 stars  (266 chars)
Every time I go their ice cream machine is down. It's a hang out for all the kids in the neighborhood. This establishment including terribles chevron connected to it, does not seem to care what goes on in or around their business. Low class for the area they are in.

REVIEW #8:  1 stars  (2407 chars)
I never thought I would write a review of a McDonalds, much less have to write a negative review for a McDonald's. I don't even know how it's possible that a McDonald's could be so bad but unfortunately this one is.    ...  ... Like many people, I have eaten at McDonalds all over America and even in several other countries.  I have to say this is probably one of the worst McDonald's I've ever been to other than the one in Manila in the Philippines -and that's only because I'm not sure that what was in those burgers was even beef. ...  ... Where do I begin? The service is terrible. I have never, not ONE time, gotten what I ordered. I get sweet tea when I ask for unsweetened. I get cheese when I ask for none. I get onions when I ask for none. I get 2 chicken sandwiches when I ask for 4 apple pies.  I have given up on going through the drive thru because I always end up having to pull around, park, go in and wait in the long line of teenagers getting shakes  just to get them to correct my order. And even then, they don't get it right and I actually have to tell them, "No see, this is a Chicken Sandwich, I ordered a McDouble." ...  ... The food is almost always cold. The burgers are dry and taste like they have been sitting on a shelf for more than an hour. And the fry's..ugh! When there are 6 cars in the drive thru and 20 people in line, I just don't understand how the fry's can be cold and stale. It absolutely defies logic.  ...  ... Yes, there are times that the food comes out hot. It's one of the reasons I keep going back. There's nothing like hot Fry's from McDonalds.. and also, just because it's McDonald's. Like it or not, it's a staple for working parents too tired to cook dinner after work some nights. It is unfortunate that they have no competition in the immediate area to keep them on their toes, otherwise they might actually try to improve their service and their product. I am sure they are turning a profit. No doubt. It seems to always be busy. However, I truly believe that if ANY other burger joint opened up right next door, this place would close down in a month. Every time I say I'm never going back, I still do. Unfortunately, tonight will be one of those nights as the kids specifically requested it. The shear dread of what I'm about to go through is what prompted this review.   ...  ... I really hope they improve. It hurts to have to knock a McDonald's.

REVIEW #9:  1 stars  (295 chars)
I'm so upset with the drive through!! As you go to pull out the curb on the left is WAY too long and I ended up turning left and hit it... It ruined my tire and rim!! My friend told me they had done the exact same thing but they are I'm an SUV so there was no damage :( I'm so bummed right now!!

REVIEW #10:  1 stars  (85 chars)
Messed up our meal three times. Simple orders too. No sweet tea available. Non sense!

REVIEW #11:  1 stars  (417 chars)
Only ordered 4 items: apple pie, bbq Ranch Burger, small fries, and large Mocha frape. Still messed up my order. Made me wait because they ran out of Mocha mix. Gave me medium frap, no apple pie. Went inside told them I ordered large and the missing apple pie. They said there were no apple pies left. Made me wait more than 10 min. And incorrect order. Just left and disregarded the pie out of my frustration. So bad

REVIEW #13:  1 stars  (876 chars)
This is probably the worst night shift McDonald's ever!!! ...  ... Their drive through service is horrendous! When you approach the drive through you wait I would say at least 5 mins before someone acknowledges you from the speaker menu. ...  ... Tonight when I went to the first window to pay no one was there! The car in front of me already left leaving me to wonder if I needed to pull up to the 2nd window instead.  I pull up to the 2nd window only to have a staff member lecture me about not paying. Which by the way I already had my money out ready to pay but because it was an inconvenience for her to walk back to the first window she felt the need to argue first.  ...  ... To top things off they had the wrong order so I had to wait again for my order.  Believe it or not it took me about 20 mins for a 10 piece nugget meal!  ...  ... I thought its called fast food!

REVIEW #14:  1 stars  (196 chars)

Worse McDonald's ever!!!  I don't mind driving down to the Blue Diamond location from now on after several times the drive thru always forgets an item I ordered!  ALWAYS CHECK YOUR BAG BEFORE DRIVING AWAY FROM THE WINDOW!!   ... To top it off I had to drive back to get the burger they forgot and what compensation I get for my inconvenient???  2 effin Apple Pies....  are you kidding me???  - 5 Stars if I could rate it like that

REVIEW #16:  1 stars  (312 chars)
WORST MCDONALDS EVER! ...  ... Every single time we have been to this McDonalds on Southern Highlands Parkway we ask for our burgers and fries to be made up fresh.  They never are, in fact, they are cold and the buns are cold as well.  Step it up McDonalds!  Your reviews are bad and this is the Manager's fault!

A McDonalds review? Yep. Because when all else fails it's really hard for someone to mess up a Big Mac. This location has a drive through that's not that bad to get through and usually moves fast at peak times. If you look through the drive through window or walk inside you'll notice it's kept clean.  ...  ... This McDonalds has kept me from being hungry when Lotus of Siam and Komol messed up my lunch more than once. And to be honest this review is just my way of saying thank you for being there as I know with a quick run through the drive through I won't be going back to work hungry.

REVIEW #2:  4 stars  (930 chars)
This one is located alongside Terrible's Gas Station, and the Albertson's Shopping Center/strip mall. We go to this one the most (though we really don't eat fast food on  a large scale anyway, ever since, our lifestyle changes), the Drive-Thru window mostly, and on occasion, inside too (clean, locals). This one is about the same distance from our home, as the one at Paradise/Sahara (way more tourists and way more cars at the Drive-Thru too), but this one is less crowded. Inside is a little smaller, than most locations, since it's sharing space with the Terrible's Gas Station and Convenience Mart. ...  ... Since we only get three items on the menu, our order's pretty easy (cone sundae, or sandwich), so it's usually right. There are usually a few cars in the Drive-Thru window too, BTW. But it's never too long of a wait.  ...  ... The gas station/mini-mart and the whole shopping center is relatively busy during the day.

REVIEW #3:  3 stars  (1176 chars)
Between two shows last night, I had about 45 minutes to kill so I drove the short distance here to get a McFlurry.  For me, McDonald's has become a place to get a  side salad or a quick dessert.  Dessert it was. ...  ... The drive through was packed, so I parked at the convenience store parking and went inside.  The staff was very friendly.  The only issue I had was with adding to my Arch card account.  They couldn't remember how to do it.  After awhile, a light bulb went off and I had some money loaded on the card. ...  ... I got my Oreo McFlurry and I sat in the restaurant to enjoy it.  It was good--typical McDonald's--it's the same at each location.  The restaurant was relatively clean.  There was a table that needed clearing but other than that, it was neat.  There's also free wifi which made checking my email a breeze.  It was very snappy. ...  ... There are some pictures on the walls that look like they are made of jigsaw puzzle pieces. One was of Ray Croc.  I couldn't tell if they were real puzzle pieces or if the art had been designed to just look that way. ...  ... I'll be back when I'm in the area of Commercial Center and need a soft ice cream fix.

If you're looking for a quick breakfast, you really can't go wrong with a breakfast sandwich and an iced coffee from McDonald's   This location is always quick...I've never had any issues with my orders or the employees here.  I've only had breakfast here so I can't comment on the rest of their menu. ...  ... My mom told me their oatmeal is really good...planning on trying that next time.  My husband also loves their cinnamon roll bites.

REVIEW #3:  3 stars  (472 chars)
It's McDonald's. You really can't ever expect a good meal from any McDonald's. That said, however, I have no complaints about this location. My order has always been correct and speedy. And the food here is no worse than the food at any other McD's location. So can I really give it fewer than 3 stars? I guess not. ...  ... Psst...want to know what my favorite thing is from McD's? It's the hot mustard sauce. I could dip practically anything in that sauce. It is so yum!

REVIEW #4:  3 stars  (760 chars)
This review is only for the drive through. I enjoy the face to face ordering instead of the intercom. It gives a better chance for them to get your order correct. The staff here is very nice. There are a few people I can think of who are not morning people and should not be working the drive through, but I can't really choose who's working the window. The wait time depends on when you actually order. It's a little longer in the morning when everyone is off to work and when people are getting off work. As for my actual orders, I haven't had an order incorrect, although they have forgotten a straw here and there or have forgotten sauce or ketchup. I just make sure everything is there before I drive off.  ... Food wise, it's McDonald's. Nothing special.

REVIEW #5:  1 stars  (414 chars)
I am truly unimpressed with this location. I LOVE a cup of coffee in the morning and McDonalds has great coffee. This location seems to be run by a bunch of children with no other purpose other than goofing off. I sound like my father. How hard is it to be polite and serve a cup of coffee? With a thousand locations within a 5 mile radius, I think a will drive and extra block or two for that great cup of coffee.

REVIEW #6:  1 stars  (615 chars)
I was just there a few days ago.  I ordered my daughter a kids meal thru the drive thru.  The women at the first window was very nice and professional.  When we drove to the next window to pick up our food the women just handed us the juice then handed up our kids meal.  The whole time talking to fellow coworkers.  We saw only the back of her the whole time.  No hello no thank you or anything.  It was the weirdest thing.  My husband and I were shocked that happen.  Sorry Mcdonalds we were bothering you.  The funny thing I think she was the manager because she was wearing a different color than everyone else.

REVIEW #7:  1 stars  (481 chars)
OK McDonald's...Please check your beverage dispensing machine. On several occasions, I've had poorly mixed coke from your unit. The coke taste watered down. Are you trying to save on cost or did you run out of product?  Never compromise on my Coca Cola drinks, I would hate to cross over to another brand. Restaurants should be mindful of their dispensing units to ensure their lines have full bag in the box running through the lines and keep the ice maker full of ice. Thank you!

I don't think this McD has ever been remodeled. Other than a badass painting of the McKingdom, there was another thing hanging on the wall which was pretty much a quilt with like cactus (cacti) sewn in to it and there was another case that had a bunch of old pins and buttons and I don't think there was a pin that was made later than 1982 or something. One was for "McDonalds Pizza" ...  ... This thing (the painting) was pretty badass though, that's why I took the pic. It's like 10' x 6'. I think it was dated 1979. Which makes sense considering that Mayor McCheese is there and the McKingdom is there too ...  ... I swear that place has been forgotten in time. Not only did it have the vintage artwork but the soda fountain was probably from the 80's as well because the ice machine and sodas were completely separate machines and there was a pay phone outside but it wasn't right outside the store, it was across the parking lot kind of in the bushes and had some weird phone company that I never heard of on it. Plus it had an electronic sliding door on the main entrance and the "Play Place" was outdoors and even had a sing that said "Please Do Not Feed The Birds". Such a weird place. It's cool because it reminds of the way McDonald's was when I was a kid but it's scary because it's not intentionally retro, it just never changed... ...  ... It's quite the experience. It's like the "Classic" McDonald's on Flamingo .....but a different kind of classic.

When you need a fast bite (breakfast, lunch, or dinner) so you can hit the road, this McDonald's is right off the 15 fwy on Charleston in the downtown area. It is clean, no bad people, and a fast drive thru. I gamble but not when it comes to fast and friendly McDonald's service. That is I like this one here.

REVIEW #5:  3 stars  (654 chars)
I used to go to this one a lot (when fast food was a regular staple in my diet, in my 20's, when my metabolism was faster, and when exercise was not such a priority)- this is one of the older ones in town.  ...  ... Recently, we went through the Drive-Thru window for some fruit smoothies. There were a couple cars in front of us. Clear mike, speedy checkout, nice girls, the correct order, and great-tasting smoothies.  ...  ... We only go to McD's for a few things (parfait, cone, and sometimes the breakfast sandwich) and even then, it's pretty sporadic- maybe a few times a year, because of the lifestyle changes we made since maintaining our weight.

REVIEW #6:  3 stars  (1074 chars)
OMG you ran out of ice cream too. WTH is going on?? I now that this is the desert and everything but wouldn't that give you even more reason to have ice cream. WTH. Food time here with friends was interesting. We looked outside to check on our car to find that there were a pair of employees making out behind our ride. Hmm. Ok. I guess you are on a break?? Anyways, the food is fine. The prices are a lil more than back home in LA. They have the double filet of fish though. So, that's cool. The hubby bought a disgustingly huge meal here for $21. Of course, we all shared. Had we not, I think he'd still be in food heaven. LOL. The restooms here are nice and clean. That's because you need to be let in to be able to use them. They dont give out tokens or anything. You actally have to be buzzed in. What the hay?! But you know, do what you must to keep it clean. The painting on the wall was awesome. I like that you can check out the old school pins that Mc D's used to have. It's in a glass case next to the soda fountain. Chill, and not too crowded. Gets the job done.

REVIEW #7:  2 stars  (1198 chars)
I have to strike this fast food venue from my normal few lunch spots for awhile.  The last two visits have been a disappointment.  My french fries were cold both times.  I ordered a Premium Chicken wrap with crispy chicken last week and received grilled chicken.  The receipt had it right so it was the line cooks who got it wrong.  Today I ordered Chicken McNuggets as a combo.  Again and as I said before, cold fries.  And I can guarantee the McNuggets weren't fresh.  I got my food before I even got my change.  It had all been sitting there well before I ordered.  Besides the food, service was terrible.  There was one lady taking orders and she was even making some of the food.  It made for some very slow service during a very busy lunch hour.  Rather than calling out an order or order number when ready, she looked at my boss and said "this is yours."  How rude!  There was a gentelman waiting for his food since before I walked in and was still waiting after I got mine.  His wife took her sandwich back and said it was not fresh.  She got a dirty look from the same rude cashier.  I miss the days of the old manager whom I have not seen in a few months.  He had the staff on their game.

REVIEW #8:  2 stars  (519 chars)
I think that the preparation was a tad lacking. I used to work at a Mc D's when I was in high school. It was the perfect job for a kid.  Anyway, my filet was lopsided. It was half way off the bun and my cheese was melted three quarters off the fish. The tartar was every where and my fries were all mushy. I can't expect much from a Mc D's but goodness. There are some interesting folks who come in and out of here. THe awesome thing was that wall of the original Ronald Mc Donald and his lil side kicks. That was cool.

REVIEW #9:  2 stars  (1153 chars)
I was not impressed with my visit this time to this location. Suprisingly it was by someone who is a shift manager who was working the window. How can you take my order over the speaker and still have a conversation with another employee? It took her several tries to get my order right!! Then when I get to the window she doesn't even say hi or tell me my total just puts her hand out for payment. As I gave her my card I asked her to please give me jelly and extra syrup and butter. All she did was smile when I said thank you. Took them a good 15 minutes to get my stuff as she was a way from window by the inside counters talking to employees. When she finally gave me my order I reasked that I got the jelly and syrup and she goes to reach to get some and then says OH its in the bag.  ... Now I ordered Big Breakfast with Hotcakes and Bacon, two sausage and egg mcmuffins, hashbrown and a coke. When I got home I got everything BUT the HASH Browns!!!! I was to get two of them one with the Big Breakfast and the extra one I ordered. UGGG it was on my receipt. the name on the receipt stated KS #15. So not right especially by someone in Management

Came here because I had to feed my daughter and well, we love McDonald's. So, while waiting for my mom which I dropped her off at Valley Hospital, I decided to go through the drive through. I ordered a kids meal and 2 big mac's with extra sauce, which I got charged extra for and I've never been charged before. There were a few cars in front of me but it went by quick. I pull up to the window for my food and ask the guy at the window which toy they had, as I always do. sad to say he didn't have much but one toy not even the special toy for kids under 3. So I get my food and go. When I get to the hospital I noticed I was not given the apple slices that come with the kids meal. WOW!! and this is why I will NEVER return to this location.

Upon my last visit ewww all I can say is ewwww ... These people at this location oh lord baby honey child they just give you cold fries. And old stale chicken nuggets they was hard like little rocks. The soda was missing soda or something it was sour. I wont ever go back to this location.. it smells funny and they looked all shocked when I asked for my money back. The outside of the bag was all wet and sticky ewwww! Thank goodness I carry hand sanitizer.

Really it should be 2.5 stars.  They have the dumbest set up for a drive through.  It runs the length of the regular parking area.  If the line for the drive through is long, they block parking spaces and you can't get in nor out!  I ended parking away from the store and walking.   ...  ... Service was fast and polite!

I totally understand that this is McDonalds and you get for what you pay, but the professionalism here needs major work. While I am waiting for my food, it would be nice not to hear yelling and workers horse-playing behind the register and in front of the store. I thought going inside would be faster since there was a line of cars circling that awful drive thru, but really I think we had waited longer going inside.

This McDonalds is terrible. I don't expect much from fast food but there is a standard... a low one but at least reach minimal expectations. ...    My son and I went through the drive through (took forever). They have the nerve to ask "is everything on the screen correct".  After we got our food, we pulled forward in the drive-thru to allow traffic to move.  I explained to my son that we need to check and make sure we got everything.... ...    I ordered big Mac meal and happy meal -burger plain. ...    They missed the toy and my fries and his burger... how?  We went inside and had to convince them that we really didn't get everything. They got what we were missing and we went home. ...    My son was disappointed.  I ordered burger plain for a reason.  They were too busy chatting behind the counter to pay attention to the order they already screwed up. No apology. Nothing.  ...    I would let this slide if this was the only time. Hire people that work!  I don't expect a five star meal but get the order right. If not the first time, at least don't screw it up twice!

Worst McDonald's by far. It always smells like sewage and the food is alway old. When you tell someone about it's like an inconvenience to them. I can't believe the manager is actually the manager. She has the personality of a rock. There are only a small amount of great employees here.

My mom and I went here for sodas around the night I moved back, they tasted normal. My husband and I got sodas this morning and I cant even describe how awful they tasted! We promptly threw them out and went somewhere else. On top of that the panhandlers and drug addicts asking for money (both times) is ridiculous. Plus, we could barely understand the lady talking through the order box in the drive through. ...  ... Don't go here!

REVIEW #3:  1 stars  (753 chars)
We are retired and have gone to this McDonald's since they built it two blocks from our house.  This last year it has gone down hill.  They are out of things often, week after week.   ...  ... The service has become poor.  Some of the long time employees are good but the bad now outweighs the good at that location. ...  ... The street people hitting you up in the drive through and inside but the managers will do nothing about them.  Talked to the owner and he said he would see thing get better but they did not.  ...  ...  After all these years we decided we no longer need McDonald's and have not been in three months.  We have ten grandkids that are not missing it either.  Poor service has cost them a lot when you think about it over the years.

I left the Hilton late last night and I was really thirsty.  This was an easy in/out option for me from Sahara.  I did the drive through and was on my way with a Diet Coke in about 2 minutes. ...  ... This is one of the remaining early style McDonald's outlets and there's a classic Chevrolet parallel to the drive through where you can take photos. ...  ... Looking through the windows, I could see the interior is also the classic design.  I'll have to go back and sit inside.  Do I see a Shamrock shake in my near future?

REVIEW #3:  3 stars  (357 chars)
1st to Review-How can this be? A CLASSIC McDonald's @offthestrip at Paradise Rd/Sahara Ave behind the Sahara Casino! ...  ... Coolest thing about this location is their collection of McDonald's Happy Meal Toys and the 50's style look & feel. ...  ... They have a 50's Chevy out front for taking photos. ...  ... Unfortunately the same boring,tasteless food.

REVIEW #4:  3 stars  (968 chars)
Out of the thousands of restaurants in Vegas, I had to pick a McDonalds...Well, its a cheap eat. Its right across the Sahara Hotel and its design is like one of those classic type McDonalds back in the 50s, just like Scott D. said below.  ...  ... There is nothing special about it. I had gone through the drive-thru at 11:30pm. I was a little scared since there was people playing music loud and just hanging around suspiciously. I had to wait 5-7 minutes for the lady to get back to me on the speaker. It wasn't even crowded inside. ...  ... Anyways, I ordered 2 McDoubles ($1 each), 2 Hot N' Spicy ($1 each), 2 Bottle Water ($1 each), and 2 Apple Pies (2 for $1), and a Large Iced Tea ($1 each no matter of the size or type of drink). My total was $9.50. ...  ... Nothing special about this place besides the classic car who probably has been waiting for service since forever. Oh well, what can you do in the city of sin?! ...  ... Have Fun here and Keep Yelping!!

REVIEW #5:  3 stars  (1315 chars)
So I'm not usually one to fuss, pretty laid back so if something bothered me then well....bravo. This mcdonalds isn't in the greatest area, I can't fault the employees for that. I can expect that they get some shady characters and they sometimes you have to handle them a little bit more aggressively. Like tonight, customer causing a minor disturbance and was rude, and the girl which appeared to be a manager of some sort was behind the counter and got upset (naturally of course) she went and handled the customer. Waited for him to come out of the bathroom just waiting there while customers including myself were in line. Ok I get it, go handle the customer, go on with your bad self and handle the shituation. Yes I said shit-u-ation. I get it, go handle the stupid idiot. But when there's a line of customers waiting for service you would think you would get someone to cover you instead us waiting 5 minutes or ATLEAST a simple apology saying "I'm sorry I'll be right with you" instead she was cursing and mumbling under her breath. OH and she proceeded to follow him outside, let it go! He left! So another employee finally started taking orders only after telling me she was already clocked out! Unprofessional. Like come on handle the idiot but don't act like one. Rant over. Oh....and my fries are good.

Grabbed quick breakfast ...service was slow and the dining room was filled with the joyful abundance of homeless and just crazy people of Las Vegas. ... As said before coffee was warm at best, my egg McMuffin without Sausage was cold and greasy!

REVIEW #9:  1 stars  (262 chars)
Worst McDonald's ever...tweekers "spare changing" freely, some lady threatened to beat another lady's ass, following her around yelling, dirty drink area, etc. The building looks good, as the only good point. I'll never return to this location if I can avoid it!

REVIEW #10:  1 stars  (387 chars)
Worst service and food I have ever experienced at McDonald's l have ever been to. ...  ... Completely wrong order. Ignored at counter when trying to get corrected and even then wrong order and yet again ignored. You would think they would be sensitive on the third time retuning to get a complete order. But no. And then ignored the fourth time when asking to get access to the bathroom.

I work in the immediate area of this McDonald's. I use it regularly. ...  This McDonald's is incorporated in a Walmart super center. After 11 a.m., it becomes a mad house. And when the high school lets out in the afternoon, students flood the restaurant. Long lines and waiting on a table are the result. If you do not like crowds that include loud high school students, I recommend avoiding this McDonald's in the late morning to mid afternoon. B.T.W., management has zero tolerance of rowdy behavior. ...    This McDonald's leans toward being a McDonald's Express. So if you want an Egg McMuffin-not here. ...    With a location in a Walmart Super Center the Eastern Beltway Center, it has a high convenience factor. ...    When the restaurant is not congested, it is a comfortable restaurant to eat McDonald's or sip coffee. I never got rushed.

I was checking out at Walmart and my two 10 year old daughter went here to ask for a small glass of water with no ice for their puppy and the girl told them that the McDonald was out of water and they could buy bottled water... They dug some of their Allowance they are saving for girl scouts to get some water for their puppy.. Poor service and bad form McDonald's!! I was furious when I got outside and heard this happened...

REVIEW #3:  2 stars  (803 chars)
It feels weird reviewing a McDonalds again, but here we go anyway. Unfortunately I've only had the pleasure of visiting this location after hours and have had different experiences each time.  ...  ... Sometimes they allow me to order select breakfast items off of their 24 hour breakfast menu, and sometimes they don't.  ...  ... Sometimes they allow me to pay with my debit card and sometimes they don't. ...  ... Sometimes the drive thru is open and sometimes the entire restaurant is closed with no warning save for traffic cones blocking the drive thru. ...  ... In case you haven't noticed a pattern, this is the most inconsistent fast food joint I've hit up. And if you do end up ordering some food late at night,  be prepared to take a mini siesta in your car while you wait for your food order.

The grease needs to be changed! It's a dark brownish color, I know because it oozed out of the hash browns. @__@ ...  My moms a freak, we all know that, but they pushed her over the edge by not having drinks ready until after the food. It's serving 101, and the Sausage McGriddle is so tiny now! ...  The other McDonalds nearby are much better.

REVIEW #5:  2 stars  (308 chars)
We hit the drive-thru for dessert tonight and I was very disappointed. I ordered a snack size M&M McFlurry and a sundae. The McFlurry ended up being vanilla ice cream with M&Ms sprinkled on top. Perhaps children don't notice that laziness but I'm no child and mixing the topping in is the entire point. Lame!

Come on McDonalds, you can do better than that!  Last week I ordered an Egg white Delight and got a regular Egg Mc Muffin, today I ordered an Egg Mc Muffin and Got a Sausage mc muffin with egg. Not sure if they just throw whatever has been sitting there the longest into your bag or what.

REVIEW #8:  1 stars  (1524 chars)
Gosh I remember when you could go to mcdonalds and get a fairly ok meal for like 3 dollars. Today they like to think of themselves as hip slick and cool pawning off god knows what kinda meat that is. This was the absolute WORST visit I have ever made to McDonalds. I was in a rush wanted to grab something quick as i was already late for a meeting about 1 minute away. I pull up order cant understand a word through the universal translator.I pull up and this kid was on drugs or is a paint huffer on the reg. Takes him about 3 minutes to figure my correct total and order at the window. I pull up wait another 8 minutes and am handed the wrong order. Then I am told to pull around to the front and wait for "fresh" fries. Pull to front,15 minutes later i get out of my car to get my order and it is coming out. I ask for ketchup and pepper,sorry sir we are out of both...WTF? you guys have one job make sure there are basics to accompany that nasty food you serve so i don't feel as though i'm eating a dog shit sandwich. Anyways,I get to my destination sure the fries were lava hot and my big mac was an fing train wreck. Cold,tasted like total crap I suspect it been sitting there since the last ice age. and to complete my abused visit I felt like i was gonna hurl afterwards. Nice going mcdonalds you guys sure have increased you're value and over all quality. i would not serve this slop to my worst enemy that would be inhumane. take a guess when i will return. Oh and what should have taken 5 minutes turned into 30.

My coworker got us lunch from this branch and were disgusted with the quality of their fries. We got 4 combos and NONE of us were able to eat it. Sadly we couldn't return them because we had to get back to work DISAPPOINTED because we didn't get to enjoy our fries since they were old/oily/stale/ and plain gross!  ...  ... On a separate visit, I asked the drive though cashier for ketchup and was told that "we are all out" when there was a whole bunch on their counter! I mean, seriously????  ...  ... ZERO STARS, go to a different mcdonalds!

Thee most incompetent staff of all time. After I ordered food I remembered I needed a gift card. I asked if I could purchase one and they said they don't take a credit cards--after I just paid with a card. And I asked to order inside and then I'll come in and pay, they said I couldn't. Wth!? What business doesn't want to make money or make their customer happy? And to top it off my order was wrong! Way to try to ruin my day

This was the first McDonald's in Las Vegas to have the new interior design & WiFi many years ago, when they still charged for it. This location is close to the corner of Sunset and Eastern, which is near the airport runway. The staff is friendly and the manager here knows how to get the customer their order quickly, even when there is a large group of people. This is a good spot to grab a drink or some food before heading over to Sunset Park across the street.

REVIEW #4:  3 stars  (525 chars)
I eat here a few times a month and since the drive thru kept dumping my drink on me (twice in a month) I started going inside where the service is top notch. Of course today was the first trip to the bathroom where I discovered no paper towels (airblowers) but since I was there to blow my nose. I used a napkin and found no trash can. Im sure thats a price saving measure but I still believe you should have one or you will find all kinds of foreign objects being flushed down the drain. Just a thought guys. Just a thought.

REVIEW #5:  3 stars  (400 chars)
Really really nice and friendly staff here.  I've mostly been through the drive-thru, and it's usually the same group of ladies working on Saturday afternoons.  Super nice and they never mess up my order. ...  ... My only issue is the drive-thru layout.  I don't like three windows, and I don't like the face-to-face ordering.  Seems less efficient, takes longer. ...  ... But all in all, good place.

REVIEW #6:  3 stars  (290 chars)
The staff is always nice to me. Of course I only know that because the drivethru kept dumping the drinks on me/my car so I started going inside to eat. I figured that was easier than dry cleaning or washing my car. The inside runs well together and handles the occasional freaks with class.

REVIEW #7:  2 stars  (573 chars)
Today I ordered small fries. The amount of salt on the fries was tremendous. I would have asked for another order of fries with no salt, but I had seen there were no fresh fries being made at the time as the fry bin was full of those dreadful salt covered fries. I was on my lunch break and I didn't have the time to wait for a fresh batch. I spent around 3 minutes wiping my fries with tissues, desperately trying to get the salt off. Unfortunately this isn't the first time this has happened at this particular restaurant location. I am reluctant to go back anytime soon.

I used to go here every morning for breakfast but no more.  This place has the rudest staff I ever encountered, particularly this one supervisor there who is bossing everyone around.  If you like psychodrama and tension in the morning, this is the place.

Crappy area, weird parking lot. There's a sign posted that said "merge" to get in to the drive thru. However when I tried to MERGE another customer refused to let me and then hit my brushguard! When I went to see the manager he said I was at fault and although the sign says "MERGE" it really means I should I have yeilded. Really? The sign did't say yield it said MERGE! Between being told my a cranky manager that I can't read, the bad area this is located in, and the aweful parking I opted to head to Del taco in a nicer area instead.

REVIEW #5:  1 stars  (513 chars)
If I owned this place, I'd fire every manager, especially the fat ass that works in the morning.   There are five people in line waiting to order and only one person at the counter.  Meanwhile I count 3 managers walking around doing who knows what.  Then this guy comes up to the counter for his free coffee refill so the girl at counter stops taking orders so she can fiddle with the coffee maker.  20 mins to get 2 sausage mcmuffins.  If there was another place on the way to work, I would say screw this place!

McDonalds and ATT have a WiFi service arrangement. I had just eaten a late breakfast, but I needed to check my email so my LA ATT.com dsl service add on gives me nationwide free wifi at McD's, Starbucks and many other locations. So, I don't like to go to a place and just use the wifi and not buy anything, so I bought the Angus burger swiss cheese/mushroom and it was okay, 3 stars, but I'm deducting 2 stars for the crappy wifi service... I've used McD's wifi service many times and at this location, I dicked around for nearly an hour and couldn't get it to work... So I bought food I didn't really want and so it was a big waste of time and money. I had to go to Starbucks and they saved my day. ...  ... Hey, I like the Carl's Jr, Big Carl burger better anyway and it's 40% cheaper.

REVIEW #7:  1 stars  (572 chars)
Not a very good McD's.  Fountain sodas are flat. Wait times at the drive-thru are ridiculous. Don't bother going inside, it's not any better service. Speak of which, how bout reiterating my order so I don't end up paying for someone else's food.  Disaster avoided! My rating was almost a -2 stars.... ...  ... Re: drive-thru ... Utterly ridiculous. 2 entrances for 1 order terminal/speaker box (right of way madness). Not to mention the horseshoe turn where it's near likely you'll hit some idiot passing through the drive-thru to get inside the McD's...not worth a visit.

The food was also not fresh I stopped there since its the closest to my work but I will drive an extra mile and go to the one on Sunset and Eastern WAY more professional and fresh!! Who ever owns this McDonald's has no clue on the behavior of their employees!

A nice central McDonald's with ample fountain drink dispensers for the visitors. Be aware of your surroundings here, it attracts a few transient people.

If you stay at the Riviera Hotel across the street, you are probably going to stop into this McDonald's for it's Wifi. ...  ...

There will be a sparse amount of homeless, but they don't seem to bother anyone.

Approximately, only one register open with 20 drunk people in line. The "pick up here" takes about 15 mins to get your food. The slowest McDonalds I been to. The dinning area isn't as clean.

Breakfast with a view! ...  ... There really is only one reason for you to go to a McD's on the strip... you're hungry and/or drunk. ...  ... As far as McD's go, this is a pretty nice one! Clean and modern with a lot of staff working all the time. ...  ... This place has one major perk though, you get to watch people misbehaving while they're drunk or on drugs! Seriously, I had a blast!! It started with me arriving while the cops were handcuffing a junkie on the parking lot. The guy was talking to himself and shouting insanely funny random words at people (purple melons anyone?) And that wasn't all! There was a sweet old lady inside (who was definitely schizophrenic) having a lovely conversation with her other selves. And the guy cleaning the mensroom was asleep inside a cubicle with the door open!  ... Loved it!

Ok ok ok, I know it's only a McDonald's, BUT this one is completely different in decor. It's big, clean, bright and pretty. With tons of flat screens all over the place.  ...  ... Another big plus to this McDonald's is that they've got free Wi-Fi (while most hotels charge ridiculous fees), so if and when you have your laptop you can deal with business while munching on some fries. ...  ... Even though it's smack dab on the strip, there's plenty of parking too!

Sometimes, you HAVE to have your McDonald's.  Even when you're in the middle of a culinary Mecca. ...  ... Apparently I'm a sucker for grand openings and press releases blown way out of proportion, because after reading about this new McD's location I made a point to come here during my vacation. ...  ... Probably the nicest McDonald's I've been to, considering there was an employee constantly cleaning and offering to clear customers' trays.  Educational excerpts from the Discovery, Science, and Travel Channels on various flat screen TVs were a nice touch. ...  ... We sat in the middle of the restaurant, on bar stools (surprise, surprise...see my Blueberry Hill review) attached to a huge counter...with fresh flowers!  We were surrounded by the typical plastic booths but I did notice that seating areas near the restrooms offered both club chairs (not sure if they were leather or pleather) and a more private booth section. ...  ... Not much to say about the food since a McNugget here is a McNugget anywhere.  But at least I got my quarterly McD's craving out of the way...

They towed my car. It happened just in 15 minutes. There's a sign saying, "30 minutes parking for McDonald's customers"  I didn't do anything wrong. ...  ...

Like all other McDonald's, the service quality is going down the tubes.  My son was getting a drink at the drink station when an older guy in his 60's was moping the floor and told me son to "move it" in a very mean and rude voice. ...  ... I went to use the restroom and there was two toilets.  One had a sign on the door that read "Out of service."  The other stall's door would not make a close connection.  I really had to go, but I did not care to have someone walk in on me when I am on the pot.  I tried slamming the door shut, but it would not make a connection.

You place your order at one end of the counter and pick up at the end of the counter. ...  ... I ordered a Quarter pounder with cheese combo and asked to make it large.  My wife simply ordered a small drink and a McFlurry.  We specifically told the girl we were eating in.   ...  ... When our number was called, our food was in a to go bag.  I was also only given one small cup.  When I asked where my large drink cup was, I was informed that the combo which I paid extra for did not include a drink???? ...  ... The lady was wearing a white shirt and spoke very poor English.  When I showed her my receipt where it said I had paid for a large Combo, she told me I was mistaken.  I then proceeded to go back to the cashier who had rung up my order and ask her what had happened.  She informed me that I should have got a Large cup as well as small cup but the lady in the white was her Manager.  I then asked to speak to another manager.  The cashier then waited until the female manager went in the back and a male manager came up, apologized, and gave me my Large cup.  ?????  He agreed that I was correct and that the cashier had rung up our order correctly but could not give me a reason as to why the female manager would not give me a Large cup.

REVIEW #14:  1 stars  (95 chars)
The only reason I came back is because they gave me free food after the fiasco from last night.

They are making this the worst Vegas experience  ... towing   ... $300 dollars for 15 minutes  ... Why instead they don't have someone giving information  ... They're making money attacking travelers

So what do you get when you are hungry...its 9AM....you only have had 3 hours sleep and you are looking for a homie who was last heard from 3 hours ago....McD's of course!!! ...  ... The sausage egg McMuffin tastes like heaven when you are a bit drunk still, driving down and around the strip. At the OJ and water.....pure re-hydrating goodness!!! The take ATM/Credit at the drive thru and are speedy and attentive when taking your order. ...  ... Oh BTW...the friend I was looking for...he was still in our hotel at the same craps table I left him at!!!!! I actually left the hotel cause I didn't think he would still be down there!! Gotta love Vegas!!

This is the most fucked up McDonald's you are gonna see.  Of course I didn't buy anything in here but really like going in there to use their bathroom because it's like negative McMoney for the big McCorporationBucks.com.  They have a shitty parking lot, people reading racing papers in the back, and a depressed Korean woman eating a chicken sandwich in the front.  There's a big old Golden Arches out there with lights all over it, like just regular light bulb lights.  The sign says "new building coming soon" and there are shitty renderings of a new fancy Dallas-style McD's with vegas lights all over it.  I can certainly wait for the new sign and building because I like the old one.  I went in here when I was buzzing on a Full Throttle slurpee which I highly recommend.

REVIEW #3:  1 stars  (374 chars)
I was walking down the Strip with relatives from out of town when they commented they were thirsty. At their behest we went into this McDonald's. ...  ... The line was long and ill-managed. Only one register was open despite the 30 or so people in line. ...  ... Most of my companions got their soda right away. One person ordered a coffee, which took 20 minutes to receive.

REVIEW #4:  1 stars  (339 chars)
John the manager at this mcdonalds was rude and did not want to provide customer service. In the middle of ordering drive through he refused to accept order. I guess he thinks because he has flashy lights he can do as he likes.  I do not recommend this Mcdonalds.  Take it for what its worth.  Hope you have a better experience than I did.

REVIEW #5:  1 stars  (856 chars)
Just having come from a trip at the hotel across the street from this little wonder, I got to speak. ...  ... Night one: About midnight I go in. There are about 5 people waiting in line. Fewer are behind the counter. The lights are on. ... Mister Manager announces "We close for 30 minutes! Order later!".  ... Curious. Rude. Dismissive. ...  ... Night two: The layout of the place makes for poor line control. From S. Las Vegas Blvd. won walks into a box type eating area, then for no good reason the ordering counters swing to an angle. One is challenged as to were the line is, and which line they are in. ...  ... The management staff was rough with staff, and the staff seemingly part of the Clinton Welfare reform failure. ...  ... People working in a McDy's on "The Strip" need a certain group of skills. ... The one's at this McDy's, lacked skills.

REVIEW #6:  1 stars  (1078 chars)
One star because McDonald's is not food... it's engineered matter that just happens to be edible. But I thought I'd review this McDonald's in particular. It's the last McDonald's I ever ate at. The year was 2004 and in the dark of night, in the cool spring air, my friends and I stumbled out of a casino, drunk from free beer and poor from expensive gambling. It was 5:00 AM and although our appetites were ginormous, our options were limited. We happened upon this McDonald's where they were offering double cheeseburgers for $0.99. I ordered three. My companions followed suit. We sat down among the other customers: three older men sparsely seated and desperate to stay awake lest they be thrown out in the street amongst the crumpled pornographic business cards. One man chewed with his eyes closed. Another bobbed his head up and down. Either he was falling in and out of sleep or agreeing with everything. The last man was not so far gone but was the dirtiest of them all. Once our burgers were consumed, we headed out. I was glad to leave... only sleep lay before me now.

REVIEW #7:  1 stars  (299 chars)
remember when i said I never eat at mcdonald's?  I think I did.  I vaguely remember a fried chicken sandwich sometime around 4am.  i think i might have slept in it, which wouldn't have been too bad, since i think it was soggy anyway.  drunk, vegas, and vacation are my excuses and i'm sticking to em

This Mcdonalds is not only in the business of making crappy food and providing even crappier service watch out for the racket they have in the parking lot . If your not careful reading the sign at the the front of the entrance it is going to cost you $195.00 in parking fees. went in to to ask the management they just blew me off. lucky they are in vegas where they dont count on repeat businesssss.

Yes, I went to a McDonald's while in Vegas.  I even went twice *gasp*  ...  ... The first time was because my friend and I felt that we had lost enough at the blackjack table, so we went to McD's to drown our sorrows in some milkshakes and McFlurries while practicing with a deck of card and some nickels. ...  ... The second time was because we hadn't eaten lunch, but we knew we wouldn't be able to make it until dinner :)  So we stopped really quickly for some fries...and more McFlurries ;) ...  ... The service isn't the quickest, but they are friendly and the food is good!  Stop in for a quick treat!

I know, really, I'm writing a review of McDonald's? Well, there is a good reason. I always pass this McDonald's when I work at a convention on the strip. It's just on my way. I do not eat a whole lot of McDonald's, but sometimes those Golden Arches just call to you. ...  ... Usually when I am on my way to work it is early morning and I have just run out of the door and I haven't eaten anything. I tend to swing through this McDonald's through the drive-thru. Usually I just get a coffee (I do have an affinity for their coffee btw), but sometimes I get the breakfast burritos. I won't lie, I'm addicted to these things. Um, I'm not even sure what is really in them, but I really don't care. ...  ... Anyway, my experience with their drive-thru staff is always awesome. When it is early in the morning and the McDonald's employees are still being really nice and happy I think that is a good thing. So props to this Mickey D's, you've earned my admiration even if you are a fast food establishment!

REVIEW #2:  3 stars  (1053 chars)
This location has always been a bit seedy. I guess they have problems with the homeless trashing their bathrooms because they make you ask to use tge bathroom & then buzz you in which is extremely inconvenient when you have toddlers who can open the door from the inside.  ...  ... The service was friendly enough, but the guy didnt have change, and though i ordered (and paid for) extra ranch, it didnt come with my meal.  ...  ... The kids area has been recently renovated. I cant say its an improvement. They took away the toddler slide area to add more seating. They didnt add that much more seating, and i miss the toddler slide for my kids.  ...  ... This location is also homeless central. There are always three or four ppl begging on the corner, and often asking for change when you walk in or out. While I dont mind giving to those less fortunate than myself, i dont like being accosted by an army of them like a zombie apocalypse.  ...  ... Three stars. Would be less except the play area looks like a big tree house , which thrilled my kids.

REVIEW #3:  2 stars  (593 chars)
This location is consistent with being inconsistent. ...  ... I frequent this location because it is close to my house. ONLY REASON. ...  ... I pretty much order the same thing every time: ...  ... 4 piece chicken nugget happy meal, ranch for my dip, for a boy and a apple juice.  ... Absolutely nothing special. ...  ... Yet, every time they forget something. One day it is the fries, next it will be his toy, some days it is the sliced apples.  ...  ... So I have to make sure I check my order every time before I leave the drive thru window. ...  ... And the inside is always dirty. Always.

REVIEW #4:  1 stars  (427 chars)
Sucks! Seriously they take cc thru the drive thru but not inside! Wth!!! There is absolutely no logic in that so after I ordered and tried to pay I was refused (even though I go thru the drive thru all the time! So I pointed out there was no signs anywhere saying that and they still refused. So I took my crew down to the one on boulder highway (where we ordered the same thing and it was cheaper) and paid inside with a card!

Dear McDonalds Corporate. The franchisee running this McD location needs to be recalled to Hamburger University and retrained on how to run their franchise properly. This location fails on so many things. Start by teaching the staff to listen to a customer's order. Follow up by teaching them the importance of order accuracy over sheer speed. Train the staff to give the customer options if something is not available. And last but certainly not least spend some money to make sure your basic equipment works correctly. For example if you're a McCafe location and every time someone rolls up to your drive thru and they can't order anything, you're really not a McCafe location at all.  ...  ... In short most of the problems at this McDonalds can be traced back to MANAGEMENT FAILURE. Someone needs to extract their head from their derriere and run this location the way it's supposed to be run. 2 Stars and a complaint to McD Corporate in Illinois is the best I can give this place.

REVIEW #2:  1 stars  (1493 chars)
I am so sorry to have to do this, I do feel that if you can't say anything nice, ... well, you know ... so I don't.  But this restaurant is awful, despite the fact that they just remodeled.  I tried it a month ago because I wanted to try the 1/3 angus burger and see what that was all about.  The burger was "okay", but it was almost necessary to run a gauntlet to get it.  Right next to the front door, they had a full, full garbage can, and the stench was horrible - right next to the front door.  And then, I kid you not, I had to walk through a swarm of flies on my way to the front counter.  NOT appetizing.  I mentioned this to friends who said call the health dept., but I'm not going to do that to someone unless I see poisoned people in the aisles, let someone else do it if they want.  The reason I'm compelled to write is that I wanted to try another product (this is really close to my house), a chicken biscuit to compare to one I had in St. Louis to see if there were any decent biscuits here and McD's advertises this all the time - the biscuit was overcooked and horrible and the chicken was burnt.  I wasn't going in after the first experience, but I figured the drive through would be okay. The first window where they take the money was "womanned" by what seemed to be the manager, she was beyond rude.  The take out window girl was nicer, at least she smiled.  There are a lot of nice nice people at McDonalds, and a few have better food, but not this one!  Again, sorry...

REVIEW #3:  1 stars  (2161 chars)
I would give this place a 0-star review if I could! I swung by with my son (autistic ADHD/severe-anxiety), and my cousin while on our way home from job-hunting. ...  ... 1. First off the cashier serving us--I had to repeat parts of the order a few times, he repeated some way wrong, then he repeated the whole thing and I heard burger in part of the order (wow this place was noisy, too), so I thought he finally got it right and I was tired of how long it took to order a burger for my son who's very particular about what he gets (was ordering as a reward for being good), and get myself and my cousin a couple spicy chickens. ...  ... 2. The guy didn't give us our soda cups, IT TOOK COMPLAINING TO ANOTHER PERSON TO GET SOMEONE TO GIVE US THE CUPS FOR THE SODAS WE BOUGHT!! (Thank you, miss!) And we weren't the only customers he wasn't giving cups to, might I add! ...  ... 3. We walked to the table to get out of the way and I looked everything over to make sure it was right...Spicy Mc Chicken instead of a burger. So I thought, they're busy, I'd ask if my son wanted to try a chicken sammich, he was fine if I scraped everything off. Someone who was working here said its not necessary and she'd get what he ordered. (Another nice lady!) ...  ... 4. The cashier came to our table and started ARGUING WITH US, walked away and asked (a manager? I couldn't see), then came back and said "We'll have to charge you to get what you wanted", when all they had to do was replace the $1 Mc Chicken with a $1 burger with only ketchup on it. Other McD's have made the simple swap without hassle when they've messed up, although mess-ups have still been rare and except for this McD, those cashiers didn't try to pin the blame on the customer! ...  ... End of it: I simply told him that he can forget about that, that we weren't going to pay extra to buy another item because HE messed up, and none of us are ever eating here again. Some other McD's can get our money. ...  ... Putting smiles on kids' faces, huh? Yeah right. ...  ...  ... EDIT: Oh, and we didn't get our receipt back, so I can't exactly take it straight to the store manager. But we did get names.

Finally left early enough for work to allow me to get a McD's coffee. I don't like the fancy coffees, just regular coffee with cream. I decided to be quick, avoid the drive-thru and go inside. My luck there was one person ahead of me, while there were at least 5 cars waiting outside. I liked the counter displays. They were a variety of coffee cups and mugs presented in such a way as to look inviting. I thought it was a nice touch.  ...  Well, my turn came and I realized just how slow the cashier was. It was as if she had not a care Umbria world. After a few moments she finally took my order. Another woman actually made my coffee quickly, and I was headed to work. My disappointment came when I realized that the coffee tasted bitter. Burnt. Ugh. I will try another McD's closer to work next time. What a let down.

REVIEW #3:  2 stars  (297 chars)
While seeing my food sit at the drive through window, I watched as the lady preferred to attend the coffee maker and then after taking her time I finally got my food as she handed me the food waiting at the window.... I could have left way before that! My fries suck and the nuggets are rock hard!

REVIEW #4:  1 stars  (344 chars)
Second time I have gone through Drive-Thru and ordered Chicken Nuggets for my nephew.  They always forget the sauce.  Called to let them know it has happened twice.  The girl on the other end of the line said to check before I leave that it's in there.   I am paying for a product and checking to see that someone else has done their job.  Sad.

This "new" location is worse than the one that closed down, down the street. The other day I asked for a McCrib & the drive thru attendant went on and on about how they don't have it till next week & that it isn't real meat & it doesn't have real BBQ sauce & questioned me why I would want that sandwich to begin with! I came back the next day & a different drive thru attendant was equally rude! If I could, I would give them zero stars.

An "A-OK" McDonalds... if you're leaving the Strip and need to stop by McDonalds for some breakfast (or quick lunch/dinner), this is a decent place to stop by. The seating is a bit strange as they've replaced the normal tables and benches with what looks to be an attempt for a more modern look... but it makes the seating a bit uncomfortable. The food tastes like standard McDonald's food and the staff were generally nice.

Came here on a short re-feul from gambling all night/morning - breakfast never tasted so good (that I can remember). ...  ... Bottomline: it seemed pretty clean in here. It's a McDonald's.

REVIEW #3:  3 stars  (304 chars)
Typical McDonald's.  I like this location because it is an easy to get just off the strip location.  It is perfect for a quick inexpensive breakfast.  Drive-thru is on pair with most "quick drive-thru's".  Interior is Harley-Davidson themed for those that like to look at things while they wait for food.

McDonalds has not the best reputation but this has been the worst fast food experience of my lifetime. ...  ... Besides waiting 20 minutes for a Big Mac, I witnessed a customer treatening to hit a member of staff. I am not sure what happened as I only arrived when the customer said he would "hit him later" and then left. ...  ... Then staff members began shouting at each other about using each other's cashier machines.  ...  ... It was so obvious that the staff were untrained and completely unprofessional.

Ok, what in the world is going on with people giving this particular McDonald's up to 5 Stars, you may ask?? ...  ... I'm glad you asked that!     :-)) ...  ... There are several McDonald's on the Strip, & this one is across the street from Caesar's Palace, & adjacent to Harrah's.  It starts outside, on the second floor. ...  ... *  There's a nice patio area out in front of the doors. ...  ... *  Inside, it's nothing short of beautiful for a McDonalds!  The dining room is stylish, & comfortable, & if it's full, which is somewhat likely, there's a nice upstairs, inside balcony.  Don't fail to look up at the awesome ceiling, either.  The Sistine Chapel has nothing on THIS place!!  Ok, it's not quite THAT nice.     :-) ...  ... *  The prices are regular McDonald's prices, CHEAP! ...  ... *  The service is perky & friendly. ...  ... *  If the "people watching" is great in Vegas, it's STELLAR in this place!  ...& it doesn't have to be 3 in the morning either, although I believe the other reviewers that it's stellar on steroids at THAT time of night!!     :-) ...  ... *  Free Wi-Fi! ...  ... A couple of little negatives cost them a Star from me: ...  ... *  The escalator wasn't operative during my several visits here over 3 days. ...  ... *  The custom in here is to wait in one line for the next available counter person, but some people don't get it & take cuts.  Management should spell out specifically how you're supposed to wait, in this super busy restaurant. ...  ... World's best McDonald's?  Could be!     :-)) ...  ...

Up in early AM, and need a quick bite? I frequented this McD's for the $1 breakfast menu (gotta save the $ for gambling!) and there's always a ton of people since it's open 24 hours.

They have a number on receipts for customers so they know which order they are. The guy calling out customer's orders wasnt even calling out numbers he was saying the items on a customers order. The people waiting right next to me were confused because some of them also ordered the same thing I did. Most of the staff looked like they didnt really give a damn about their job. I wouldnt give a damn neither if I was working at a McDonalds at 3am in the morning.

REVIEW #8:  3 stars  (598 chars)
Being Vegas and all restaurants assuming you just hit the mega-millions jackpot, it's nice to see some lower priced food ON the Strip. There's definitely better food out there, but in a bind, not so bad. It was over 100 degrees today so I came in for a cone. Again, not a terrible place to take a load off... but I'd suggest hanging out in a shopping area (i.e. the Forum or Palazzo Shoppes) if you'd like to just sit to wait for someone. This McDonald's can get quite busy and crowded. ...  ... With that said, it's what you would expect. Fast food. Nothing special about this particular location.

I strongly recommend only eating here if your hotel is close enough for you to take the food back there to eat it. It's ridiculously loud inside, and the patio tables outside are covered with pigeon droppings (didn't stop anyone from eating out there, which blew my mind) Service and food is standard McD's of course, but consider it to-go only.

REVIEW #12:  3 stars  (863 chars)
It's a very unique and very conveniently located McDonald's. Almost seems as it is part of the same building as Harrah's. Although they are really open 24/7, their entire menu is not available at all times. In my opinion and I love their breakfast most of all, they switch way too early in the morning. A few nights it was 4:00 a.m. on other nights by 3:30 a.m they had already switched to breakfast. During weekdays you will have no problem finding a table for yourself and your family. On the weekends, however, good luck. There is seating upstairs, downstairs and outside. Still was difficult to find a table for just myself on the weekend. Primarily in the morning. Other than the cool arch, it's your typical McDonald's. If this location isn't close to your hotel, fret not my dear friend on a budget, there is literally a McDonald's everywhere on The Strip.

REVIEW #13:  3 stars  (325 chars)
Quick place to grab a cheap bite to eat no matter what time of day it is. The lines can get pretty long so bring your patience.

You would think that McDonald's on the Vegas strip would know what their customers want at 3AM in the morning. Unfortunately they do not. For some reason this McDonald's did not have a late night menu. They switch to a breakfast only menu way to early in the night!

This review is only for the strawberry milkshake.  ...  ... We stumbled into this mcdonalds because the girlfriend had a sudden craving for Mickey d strawberry milkshake.

They tried to steal money from me!  Coming right from an ATM, all I had was $20 bills. I ordered $8.90 worth of food and the casheer gave me $1.10 back. He claimed that I gave him $10. When I said no, he made a loud fuss, had someone come by and said that the manager was going to count the drawer and see if there was extra money. After about 15 minutes, someone came back and said that the drawer had the right amount of money in it. I said I wanted to speak to the manager and they said ok. The manager never came out, but a large black man (that had been talking previously to the cashier) told me about a story where someone made a "big deal out of nothing and one person went crazy on that person". I assumed that he was talking about me and my missing $10, so I asked him what he was here for and if he was going to buy anything. After another 15 minutes, the came out and told me that they had recounted and realized that they were $10 over. They then gave me my money. The cashier made a condescending remark to me and I left. I believe his name was Lorenzo.

This is a good McDonalds it is usually pretty busy though, inside is nice and well kept, it's actually one of the nicer interiors of a McDonalds that I have seen In the valley.  The drive through is usually pretty busy due to the layout but its usually quick.  The food I get is good and if you haven't tried it get a McDouble with Big Mac sauce, i highly recommend it, it's excellent!!!

REVIEW #2:  1 stars  (803 chars)
First of all let me say that this McDonalds doesn't have a sign in their drive thru stating that they charge for Ranch.  ... Second of all customer service sucks here. I know that you can't expect them to treat super great but at least have respect. The stupid cashier at the 2nd window was Rude about me asking for ranch then got her manager which wasn't that nice either. ... Third of all when I get home, my order is missing! I was missing one of our burgers.  ... Then I try to call them but no answer. Why do they have a phone if they won't answer? So guess what store#18966 I call the 800 number and did a complaint. Hope you learn to have respect, I'm not asking for u to all happy and jolly JUST RESPECT! ... Forgot to mention that my husband's fries where half way full! What's wrong with them!

REVIEW #3:  1 stars  (831 chars)
I've here tons of times per month for the last 6 mos.... took my business to this location after a nearby Mc D's kept screwing up and giving me the wrong order entirely every time, including giving me diet soda. ...  ... Today is like the third time in the last 2 weeks that I've ordered a DR PEPPER and got a DIET COKE, which I'm incredibly allergic to! Thanks for not taking the time to be careful of giving people something they didn't order! Maybe you guys need to be educated about artificial sweetener (which diet is worse for you than regular btw, readers) being a major 'food' allergy, before someone gets a lawyer. If it was my grandpa we were just getting a soda for, he'd be in the hospital right about now. ...  ... Thanks guys for making my insides burn for the next several hours!! I really (DON'T) appreciate it!!!!!

I agree with Douglas--this is one of the best McDonald's in Las Vegas.  I stopped here for a quick ice cream last night and I was immediately impressed with the newness and nice design of the place. ...  ... The staff took my order quickly, and I was on my way to a table very quickly.  The tables were clean and the restaurant was clean.  I was really impressed! ...  ... They have free wifi which is a nice bonus.  If I need at break some day and I'm in the area, I'll definitely stop again.

I am not a fan of fast food. But sometimes a girls gotta eat late! I came here after my LONG flight from Honolulu and I was pretty darn hungry.  ...  ... They were out of Southwest salads, but the bacon chicken wasn't bad. The salad was still fresh and the chicken was warm. I would go back if I ever had a late night McCraving!

I'LL HAVE ONE BREAKFAST MCMUFFIN, HOLD THE GUNFIRE ...  ... If you're in Vegas for an event at the Convention Center, you'll probably be up early enough for breakfast. If you're not there on work, you might just want to sleep through this part of the day. McDonald's breakfast is not sold nearly long enough. I never make it there on time! How hard would it be to serve eggs all day?!!  In any case, this McD's is convenient to the convention center. ...  ... We stopped here more than once on our last Vegas trip a couple months back. On one of the visits while dining in, we noticed a bullet hole in the window from the night before. Someone probably mad about breakfast not being served all day is my guess. ...  ... Service was good. Food was average. The coolest thing about this location was the deco. It was so modern inside. Clean and cool. I like that.

REVIEW #5:  4 stars  (850 chars)
So I love McDonald's breakfast and we were on our way to the convention center for the Heli-Expo and I ordered my usual of one bacon egg and cheese biscuit, and one bacon egg and cheese McGriddle and they were great as usual.  The service was also quick and good. I don't understand the people that complain about the service or food from McDonald's what do you really expect.  Go somewhere else if you want better service, or literally go anywhere else but don't complain you know what you are getting yourself into.   ...  ... After we sat down and got our food we noticed that one of the huge front windows was completely shattered.  It actually looked really neat and then we asked what happened they said that someone shot it the night before.    ...  ... The other nice thing about this McDonald's is it has free Wi-Fi for all of its customers.

REVIEW #6:  4 stars  (774 chars)
This McDonald's is located just a couple of blocks from the hotel I stayed at in Las Vegas - an Embassy Suites Hilton property - therefore it is within walking distance (There does not appear to be many businesses within walking distance of this hotel). ...  ... Had a late lunch here around 2:00 pm.  Ordered the #3 value meal: Quarter Pounder w/ cheese, medium fries and lemonade. ...  ... Meal came up promptly, was hot, not greasy, fries were crisp - all was good! ...  ... Interesting note: in order to use the restrooms - you have to let them know at the counter - and then they buzz you in - no physical key. Makes me wonder about the status of the surrounding neighborhood! ...  ... There is also a large red DVD rental machine in the dining area of this Mickey D's.

I'm a Mclover, and I had no problem ... with the workers. But I have a problem waiting more than 30 minutes for my cheeseburger. They weren't even busy! This was my first and last time at this location.

Please people if you are looking for a "fast food" to eat do not go to this place. 15 minute for a simple double cheese burger. Employees work slower then my grandma.

REVIEW #10:  1 stars  (330 chars)
The service here was terrible. They got my breakfast order wrong three times, each time with the same exact mistake. The morning  cashier there, dalia, didn't even attempt to move a muscle to get me the right order. Food is just like any other mcdonalds, service was the worst. There's 50 others you can go to within a mile anyway

It's Vegas. People are already walking outside. It's kinda crowded and it's only about 830AM. I was hesitant to see all the people standing inside but I needed to get something quick and simple for my boyfriend. ...  ... Let me tell you; I was in/out in maybe 5 minutes tops! I ordered two egg white breakfast sandwiches, two large orange juices, and a side order of pancakes. I ordered, walked off to go stand in a corner and my order was ready! I was blown away! ...  ... Staff are quick, efficient, and on-point. Kudos to all these employees for working so hard and fast to cater to everyone down here!

REVIEW #2:  4 stars  (191 chars)
Great place to stop in for a late night snack and escape the high prices of the strip.  It was very crowded when I went, but true to the fast food industry name, my order came out very quick.

REVIEW #3:  4 stars  (377 chars)
In the three days I was in Vegas I went to Mc Donalds five times. Four out of the five times was at this location. I told myself that I would not go to Mc Dinalds but I have to admit how handy this place was. Sometimes when your drunk and hungry a fifthteen dollar burger isnt going to cut it, sometimes you just need a dollar menu. Great location. Get filled up for less here.

REVIEW #4:  4 stars  (1252 chars)
The Las Vegas Strip is the adult Disney Land. And the majority of restaurants charge Disney Land prices for food. When I want to save money on the Strip, I will visit a fast food restaurant. Last night, I tried the newest McDonald's on the Strip. ...  ...    This McDonald's opened a few weeks after the Harmon Road pedestrian overpass. It is located at the lower right corner of the new mall that went up at the northeast corner of Las Vegas Boulevard and Harmon Road, below the new Harmon Road pedestrian bridge. It is a modern two-story McDonald's that would fit in at Midtown Manhattan. In contrast to the McDonald's about a block away the outside is more low key. Instead of giant arches there is only an "M." With the exception of somebody asking me for change (expected on the Strip) it felt like I was eating in a classy fast food restaurant. The interior is modernism and everything is new. ...  ...  Kudos to McDonald's for keeping that price relative to the off strip locations. in my opinion paying approximately $8 for a ranch BLT value meal large size is worth it.  ...  ...    With restaurants on the Las Vegas Strip charging Disney Land prices, sometimes McDonald's will do. I see myself returning to the newest McDonald's on the Strip.

REVIEW #5:  4 stars  (960 chars)
YES, the Strip needed another McDonalds, as the ones above this one (3475) & just below it (3755) are SO busy all the time!  This lovely new location is tucked around the corner from a very popular Walgreen's, on the corner of Las Vegas Bv. & Harmon, but isn't crowded, as the the throngs haven't discovered it yet.  What you get here is fast little or no line service in a stylish, up to the minute 2-story location with a friendly staff, out-of-the-way corner tables available to tuck yourself away in downstairs if you like, or your choice of stairs or an elevator to take you up to the second floor dining room. ...  ... The only drawback I could come up with for this new location is that if you're a guy using the urinal, your hardware is right out in public whenever anyone opens the door, as there's no partition between you & the hallway, & no lock on the door.  Whatever...  this is Vegas!     :-)) ...  ... 4 Stars for this nice brand new McDonalds!

REVIEW #6:  2 stars  (217 chars)

"Can't believe I'm rating a fast food joint..." ...  ... This review is for rating McDonalds only! ...  ... I'm not positive why California McDonalds cannot be like this one.  I'm not sure if it's like all of this throughout Las Vegas, but this is one sure delicious McDonalds.  This is because one item on there dollar menu.  I do not care this is fast food!  I live off this for the whole Halloween weekend.  This and cranberry and pomegranate juice. ...  ... No need for fancy buffets, when the Hot N Spicy comes as a luxury because it's not served in California.  Yes, they actually use the word spicy correct in a restaurant.  Because this sandwich did have a kick to it.  Here in the states, usually when it says spicy - the word spicy usually means American spicy.  American spicy is like a Asian person's mild.  This had an Asian kick of mild/spicy. ...  ... Now lets talk about the crisp.  The crisp of this sandwich was definitely there.  Every single bite, was a crunch, crunch, and crunch.  Hot steamy buns, tossed with some mayo and lettuce and I was set.  This was just goodness coming out of fast food. ...  ... If you like the McChicken, and you like spice... This is the perfect sandwich for you.  No need to go home and add saracha.  You will get the spice built into the batter. Just chomp chomp and chomp.  And be satisfied.

REVIEW #4:  5 stars  (457 chars)
FIVE STARS, THREE WORDS: ...  ... HOT N SPICY! ...  ... The only reason we came here was in search of the holy grail McChicken, the Hot N Spicy. We heard about it from some randoms, and we had never heard of it so went to check it out. It was tucked away in a corner, so it was never packed, always clean and had quick service. Why do they not have these in California? I'll never know, but I'll definitely hit this spot back up for late night drunken eats!

REVIEW #5:  5 stars  (395 chars)
Go to McDonalds to get what you expect. Cheapest meal on the strip. Split the 20 piece nuggets with my mom and got two double cheeseburgers (which we didn't even eat, hello breakfast!) for $7! wouldn't be so excited normally but paying upwards of $30 a person made me really appreciate what McDonalds has to offer. For $5 more, this one offers 2 complete meals. Go here for a cheap meal anytime.

The only two reasons I would review a fast food restaurant are good or bad service experiences. I had a great experience here. I ordered two Spicy McChickens (wish they had this in CA), 10 McNuggets, and fries. Since I had to wait a long time for my order, however, I received a bunch of freebies that I didn't even ask for: a large soft drink, 10 more McNuggets, and another Spicy McChicken. Hehe I love these victories.

REVIEW #9:  5 stars  (458 chars)
This is one of the best McDonalds I've been to. It has been remodeled in the past few years, so it looks nice and it is kept clean as well. This was a great place for my sister and I to sit and cool off and get ice cream while the adults were playing a game downstairs. I think it was more than the McDonald's in my area (I think...), but it was well worth it-I saw it as paying a couple of extra cents to sit in an air conditioned place on a hot summer day.

REVIEW #10:  5 stars  (502 chars)
This place was an oasis. A mirage that turned out to be real. We walked for what seemed like hours in the blistering Vegas wind. Trudging slowly, like two novice drinkers, deprived of water weight and nourishment.  ...  ... Once we arrived it felt just like McDonalds at home. +1 smelly bum that sat behind us. Hey, bums gotta sit too. But man he was smelly. ...  ... We got breakfast there and were able to gamble playing Monopoly at the same time. We won another breakfast sandwich. I love McDonalds.

REVIEW #11:  5 stars  (1318 chars)
You MUST try this place if you come to Vegas!  First, the burgers are awesome, whether you get the regular hamburger or the huge quarter pounder, they are juicy and delicious and prepared exactly as you want them. They cook them in advance so you don't have to wait very long.  ...  ... I ordered their specialty burger, which is called the Big Mac, boy does the name fit. It comes with two all beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, all on a sesame seed bun. Simply amazing.  ...  ... You should also get their fried potatoes, which are called French Fries. Not sure what is French about them, but they sure are delicious, especially with the tomato based dipping sauce.  ...  ... They have a fried fish sandwich which features a tender and moist fillet of locally caught cod. You can get it with or without cheese.  ...  ... I haven't tried everything on the menu yet, but I recommend ordering one of their creatively packaged combo deals. They all come with the main sandwich, French Fries, and a drink. You can get a soft drink or one of their delicious milk shakes.  I am pretty sure they are made with hand scooped ice cream.  ...  ... I will be sure to return to this restaurant next time I find myself on the Las Vegas strip and  want what is possibly the best dining experience around.

After a good night at the club me and my friends wanted to grab some grub before we knocked out for the next day. We went to club Pure that night so what did we see across the street? A huge ass M which meant food so we were there.  ...  ... So i guess it's a 24 hour McDonalds and i would honestly hate to work there because you are guaranteed to get drunk people every night. One of the employee's job was to make sure no one brought alcoholic drinks inside the restaurant which i have to say sucks.  ...  ... It was around 2:30am and the lines were pretty long. I guess everyone had the same idea as we did. It took kind of long since some of the drunk people in front of us could hardly function, but it was understandable. Annoying, but understandable. So i finally ordered my food and had a wait for a while because they were busy.  ...  ... Since we were staying at Treasure Island we figured we could just walk down that way and cross there. Apparently i was too drunk to realize and totally forgot that you can only cross at the Harrahs, or all the way down at the Encore. So we headed toward the Encore and we had to back track a couple of blocks. We could have just gone back to the Harrahs and crossed and save about 10-15 mins..but whatevs...  ...  ... Anyways, it was clean, legit, and you get to take an escalator to get to the restaurant. How fun when you are drunk!

REVIEW #13:  4 stars  (564 chars)
I definitely needed a snack because i was drunk and there would be no time for dinner. Since I'm already spending all my money on drinking and gambling, I decided to go cheap on the meal so dollar menu it is. We go to the McDonalds on the strip with the Big Golden Arches, can't miss it. We order and two seconds later my Hot and Spicy McChicken was ready. It was hot and right off the grill. They customer service is fast and friendly. ... We decided to walk around instead of sitting in the dining area, but it looked as if there was plenty of space to sit down.

REVIEW #14:  4 stars  (1139 chars)
I do not like McDonald's. However, I am must rate this life- and money-saving institution at the Strip highly because it has served me well, and will continue to do so in all of my future visits. ...  ... The place is clean. The line is short (but then again, I can only vouch for the line between the hours of 0400 and 0700). SERVICE IS SWIFT. And before you sober up, you're out the door with your breakfast in tow. ...  ... What must be commended the most here are the workers. These hardened fellows have seen the best and the very worst of the people of the Strip. These experiences have evolved them to be immune to blatant judgement of the victims and casualties of a good night in Vegas. So shame not my fellow Strip party goers - this is the place to order your 4am breakfast burrito. In Vegas for EDC? Make sure to stop by here to order something to eat to replenish your energy for the next night. I hear a smoothie goes down the easiest after a hard night of raving. The workers here will not judge your zombie gait and your wide-eyed gaze. ...  ... For these reasons, I thank you McDonald's for taking care of me and my peers.

REVIEW #15:  4 stars  (765 chars)
I just saw someone else review about 50 chicken nuggets for 9.99, I would've gotten that and split it with a bunch of drunk people if I knew. ...  ... I did come here when it was 109 degrees outside on a June day, I was baking in that hot ass sun.  I came here for some french fries, a few Snack Wraps (grilled and fried Ranch and Honey Mustard, thank you) and for a fucking Mocha Iced Coffee.  I was cheaper here than it was in NY, I was like I could drink this good ass tasting Mocha Iced Coffee every day, but no I didn't. ... Convenient location, I was staying right near here.  It sure did the job when I had a short walk back to Polo Towers on June 16th.  Great times, 24 hours too at this McDonalds, and only saw a few shady looking characters- NOT too many.

This is a great location right on the strip and not as run down as most others. ... Why eat McDonalds when there are millions of super exclusive only in Vegas options? ... Because the food is expensive as hell, because you gambled all your money away, cuz your drunk as shit and a dollar burger will hit the stop right about now? ... Whatever it is, they are there for you 24/7 and they sure hit the spot for me NEEDING an egg McMuffin after a long booze filled Vegas night. ... That and their new chocolate chip frappe. ... I was on my way to Coffee Bean and Tea leaf for an ultimate Mocha when i stopped to get the McMuffin here, my husband got  the chocolate chip frappe and it was so good that we got two more. ... Best damn thing McDonalds ever did and for that i am a fan!

REVIEW #20:  4 stars  (359 chars)
This McDonalds is like any other McDonalds...  however, this one gets 4 stars because it is a NEVADA McDonalds... which means it has the SPICY McCHICKEN!  ...  ... Every time I go to vegas, I stop in at a McDonalds just for the spicy mcchicken.... they don't have it on their Cali menus and its oh so much better hot and spicy! Perfect cheap drunk/sober food.

REVIEW #21:  4 stars  (353 chars)
This place threw me off... with their single yellow arch that stretched onto the street. Somehow in my second hand smoke induced state, I found the single arch humorous. Ended up satisfying my craving for fries at a normal decent price. Also, this location sells SPICY McChickens! Mmmm... I haven't seen that in California! Also carries Cherry Pies too!

REVIEW #22:  4 stars  (699 chars)
This place was such a big shock to us because of their 50 Chicken McNugget for $9.99 deal (which is sad now because the deal is now at ALL Mickey D's... so its not so special anymore). ...  ... Anyways we came back from clubbing at Tao and we got our 100 nuggets, between the 4 of us. I loved seeing the kinds of people at that time... we saw workers who just got off their shifts, professionals, college kids in clubbing clothes like we were, grandparents... we're all different but we got two things in common.. our love for McDonald's and that we're in VEGAS! ...  ... Oh yeah.. the food, you should already know what Mickey D's food is like. ...  ... One star off for having a shady parking lot!

Was excited Monte Carlo had a 24 hour McDonalds right by the lobby, and our first meal (*snack) was here. The only reason why I am writing this review is they have a $1 menu, and the mini meals. Also, they don't have the McChicken, but a hot and spicy McChicken, which I hadn't seen, and it is GOOD. and SPICY! I also saw they had the double cheeseburger still for $1, which it isnt in CA, or at least the one I go to. ...  ... Quick and fast!

After a crazy night in Vegas, this is the funniest place to end up at the end of your night. At around 3am, 100% of the patrons here are incredibly drunk and under the influence of something. Everyone in line is just squirming around. My gf and I stood behind a bunch of college kids making out. Hilarious? Yes. Delicious? No... ...  ... On to the food. It really is your average fare. Not much different than any other McDonalds. Like a fugly hook up in the morning, you wake up the next day wondering why you had Mickey D's in the first place. OH! That's right, you were drunk!

I am in line for a Sausage McMuffin with Egg.  There are two lines and they are  at least 20 people deep. I am at the end.  This will take at least a half an hour. I talk to a woman in line who is from Georgia.  This is her first time in Vegas.  She tells me the trip was relatively affordable because they are splitting the cost of the room with her boss and friend. I ask her how she likes Vegas so far and she says she loves the artwork and all of the sculptures. I think an elitist might snicker at that, laugh at the fact that someone thinks they are viewing culture in such a material saturated town. She thinks what she sees are cultural artifacts and she is correct. This is America and this is where America comes to let loose, lose money and gawk at the lifestyles of the more fortunate in regards to both wealth and looks.  ...  ... I take my tiny bag and Diet Coke and sit at the counter alone. I eat my sandwich and wish I would have ordered a hash brown. I look out the window and see mainly elderly people have coffee and breakfast. I see some girls sitting at a table and they are all looking at their phones the others go inside to order and one stays behind looking through her LV purse for reasons none other than the fact she is uncomfortable sitting alone even for a few minutes.  ...  ... I throw my bag in the trash, walk out the door and choose the stairs over the escalator and think about the gondolas in The Venetian, the clouds on the ceiling and how the lights and mural make you feel like your outside when in fact you are in a mall similar to the ones you'd find in your own home town minus the opera singing actors and hyper-sexualized ads at every turn.

I know, I know.  It's a fast food joint...what is there really to say?  It's not like the food here is going to taste all that different than a McDonald's just about anywhere else.  So, with all of the great restaurants and buffets in Vegas to eat at and Yelp about, why the hell am I reviewing a McDonald's you ask?  Well, I'll tell you why: ...  ... 50 nuggets for $9.99.  (edit:  how awesome would it be if FIDDY CENT was FIDDY NUGGET?  Okay, anyways...haha). ...  ... I know...crazy, right?  Now, you're probably thinking that's either (A) an amazing yet awesome deal, or (B) an amazing yet kinda disgusting one.  If you aren't really sure how you feel, figure it this way: if you're in line with your friends, riding a good buzz and feeling hungry in the middle of the night, you're probably thinking (A).  If you're pretty sober, waiting for your drunk friends to buy food and bring it to the table, you might find yourself leaning towards (B).  Now, if you're sitting there at the table, wondering how the hell you and your 11 friends ended up getting two orders, yet still find yourself having some because really, who is going to notice a few of the 100 or so missing, then...well, welcome to my world! ...  ... Kudos to them for staying open 24 hours and being there for my friends when we found out Pink's was closed.  And remember, sometimes it really is true that "what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas".  Just ask all those nuggets we left behind that we couldn't/refused to finish.

I've had a number of Spicy Chicken sandwiches before but I must admit that at this McDonalds, these sandwiches are spicy!!  ...  ... Fresh french fries? Not here... they were as cold as cold can be. Very disappointing. ...  ... Overall, it was a decent place to grab a cheap ice cream cone and a sandwich to try and not spoil being hungry for dinner time at Benihana!

REVIEW #29:  3 stars  (444 chars)
Not fair that the meal prices are bumped up because its located on the strip. (But i actually never went inside so Im getting this feedback from my cheap brother!) ... Thumbs up that its located on the strip though! ... Little scary as I sat in the parking lot and watched bums and the night crew doing the trash run. Looked dirty from the outside..but i was outside!  ...  ... Hey it was late..I ate the food. They served the purpose I needed.

REVIEW #30:  3 stars  (293 chars)
Pros: Spicy McChicken $1. Really good. A specialty late night snack on the strip. Fast service. ...  ... Cons: Very dirty. Tons of bums. Line can go down the stairs on some nights. They run out of certain foods. Machines break down. ...  ... What else do you expect in the middle of the strip?

REVIEW #31:  3 stars  (654 chars)
So a few cocktails may have inspired some "it's-midnight-and-I-NEEEEEED-some-McD's" munchies.   ...  ... However, this McD's was right next door to our hotel and it really hit the spot.  It's easy to stumble to....I mean, find...  And it was hot and fresh. ...  ... What I did not appreciate was the fact that when I checked the bag ( I am SO glad I always check the bag, and here's why), they were missing a medium fries AND a big mac.  Not cool. ...  ... Then when I brought it to their attention, there was no apology, no eye contact, there were actually no words whatsoever.  They just put the missing items in the bag and walked away.  Umm.  Thanks?

REVIEW #32:  2 stars  (507 chars)
A typical Las Vegas Strip dive. Full of drunks looking for greasy food at night. Filthy dirty inside. Soda machines are all out of carbonation. My wife had to wipe the seats and table herself before we sat. She even put down a layer of napkins before sitting. To top it all off something is dripping out of the ceiling. I gave it two stars because it's exactly as I imagined it from the outside view and it's cheap.  Plus the grease is a great remedy for a twisted tummy after a long hard night of drinking.

REVIEW #33:  2 stars  (647 chars)
It was okay customer service, and in a way I can;t believe I went here....Mc Donald's always somewhere where you can expect the usual prices, but the crowd was uncomforting to be around....felt like I was in a mix of a social security office in the poverty back when my family was struggling between advertising/dealing on the streets with flyers..but maybe I;m just being unkind, which I guess I am. At least the drinks were okay.....The thing hated most, the cheese! What the heck kind of cheese was this man? Government artificial cheese? Highly dissatisfied, made the whole burger unexceptional and sad on McDonald's management and Vegas part.

REVIEW #34:  1 stars  (677 chars)
Horrible, horrible service. The cashier who rung in me and my parents was Amanda, and she honestly acted like she was doing me and my family the biggest favor by taking our order. I'm asked her to make my egg mcmuffin without the egg yolk (which is something i have done whenever I order an egg mcmuffin) and she first asked me what an egg yolk was (i explained the yellow thing in the center) and then she said there was no way she could do that. That's a blatant lie. Everytime I order this I don't eat the egg yolk. I was extremely frustrated, and then she told me she asked her manager who also said that could be done. Needless to say we left, and we're never coming back.

HUUUUUUUMPH. ...  ... Boyfriend and I..... drunk....walked past by this branch and all of a sudden wanted a double quarter pounder with cheese and a 20pc nuggets. ... I also for some reason wanted a double cheeseburger with extra onions. ...  ... We had the bag and been munching on the fries on our long walk to Mandalay...only to find out...they didn't put my double cheeseburger in the bag..but charged me for it. HUUUUMPH! ...  ... Dont' do that to me when I'm drunk.

REVIEW #36:  1 stars  (1210 chars)
I used to despise McDonald's. The service was slow, the employees were rude, and worst of all, the food was greasy and incredibly unhealthy. Over time, McDonald's built up their image, introduced some healthy menu items, and slowly regained my interest. ...  ... Walking down the strip, I was craving some affordable food. (Whoever said Vegas had cheap food must have lost their mind.) The arch bursting forth onto the sidewalk not only grabbed my interest, but made me incredibly excited to get a salad. ...  ... When I walked in, the place was a lot of smaller than I would have expected, but there was only one person in front of me, so I figured it wouldn't matter since there wasn't a crowd.  ...  ... I placed my order and stood off to the side. The salads are usually made at the beginning of the day, and it takes less than a minute to grab the salad, the dressing, and plastic-ware. However it took over 20 minutes to get the damn thing. Not only that, but they tried giving me the wrong salad several times, then told me they were out of the dressing I requested, then blamed it on someone in the back kitchen.  ...  ... Really though, I'd rather overpay at one of the nicer casinos. Skip this place.

REVIEW #37:  1 stars  (597 chars)
I'm a fan of McDonald's... this particular one, however, not so much.  We waited in a long line around 9pm just to deal with not-so-friendly service.  I have to get honey with my chicken nuggets and according to the staff, they don't have it.  They were also "sold out" of milkshakes.  Have you ever heard of a McD's selling out of milkshakes?  Think not.  The soda/condiment area was dirty, so much that I almost skipped the ketchup.  We sat outside on the patio, even though it was a bit chilly, to avoid the odd stench inside.  This is the worst McD's I've ever been in.. and that's a big feat.

REVIEW #38:  1 stars  (151 chars)
just cause it's right here on the main strip, doesn't mean that the service is better. try getting your food in 10 minutes from the time of your order.

REVIEW #39:  1 stars  (118 chars)
Worst experience ever !!! They took over 20 ns to get me my food and that was the drive thru !!! Never coming again !!

REVIEW #40:  1 stars  (259 chars)
Worst McDonald's ever. Full of drunk people off the strip. Bums hang around inside and outside the restaurant. Hookers and pimps hang out there. The employees are loud and ghetto and very unprofessional. Go to the nicer McDonald's by Planet Hollywood instead.

REVIEW #41:  1 stars  (333 chars)
Yes, we stopped here to grab a late-night burger.  The group didn't feel like shelling out tons of dough for a proper restaurant meal when we just wanted a snack.  It just wasn't the cleanest and most pleasant of places to sit and eat.  You have been forewarned:  all sorts of odd-looking customers run in and out of this McDonald's.

It's your typical McDonald's, the difference here is that it's open 24 hours! ...  ... A ton of seating. Fast service even in the early morning hours. ...  ... Perfect if you're staying at the MGM Grand.

REVIEW #2:  4 stars  (313 chars)
This is your typical McDonald's fare in a food court setting. It was definitely the least expensive meal of the weekend and I was happy to see that they have normal McDonalds prices, including the dollar menu (a lot of touristy places do not).  The line moved quickly and my order was correct. No complaints here!

REVIEW #3:  3 stars  (418 chars)
Biggest collective lines of anything at MGM Grand as far as I can tell. The food is fine here. My only issue that is, apparently, they decided to pull some customer unfriendly design stuff by having people wait for their food at the counter at the same register that they ordered from, so it looks like it's moving really slowly at times. Still, it's cheaper than everywhere else, so it's "A-OK" as Yelp calls 3 stars.

REVIEW #6:  3 stars  (1075 chars)
Went to this in late January when returning from a late night walking out on the strip (probably between 12 and 1 in the morning), trying to find something to eat in the giant MGM.  Seemed like we had to walk forever to find this place, which we weren't actually looking for, but rather were just trying to find something to eat, period.  The other places at this food court were closed and the only other signs of life were the blasting music coming from the clubs before and after it. ...  ... A typical McDonalds which I guess is opened late, if not all the time?  They did have something I never saw before, which was being able to order 40 nuggets (I think?) at a time, which is no doubt popular for the cheap party crowd?    ...  ... Anyways we had quarter pounders and fries which weren't anything special and really nothing more than a way of taking care of a late night hunger.  Service was ordinary, and the tables in the food court were in decent repair with a sleeping bum (I'm assuming by his clothing and appearance) and some young college aged kids as patrons.

REVIEW #7:  2 stars  (371 chars)
Surprisingly, you'll end up going to McDonald's more often than not in Vegas for the following reasons (1) it's a cheap option; (2) it's a convenient option; (3) it's probably one of the few options late at night.  Lines tend to be long here at the MGM Food Court and it's not a very luxurious experience.  Come here only by necessity.  [Original Visit: November 6, 2010]

REVIEW #8:  2 stars  (1073 chars)
The ABSOLUTE worst McDonald's on the planet! PERIOD! The only reason why I didn't give them a 1 star is because Mcdonald's food is great! ...  ... The service at this particular restaurant is by far the suckiest form of service known to man. My 4 year old niece delivers food to me in a more respectable way. After waiting in line for 45 mins to order, you have to wait another 45 mins to get your food. The only thing I can imagine playing in my head while watching how the workers go about their duties could be circus theme music.  ...  ... We were talking to people around us while we stood in amazement on how bad the service was. One lady waited 30 mins for coffee, not leaving just to see how long it would actually take for her coffee to come. After the second time she asked for her coffee, the manager herself had the audacity to give her attitude.  ...  ... As a continuing supportive customer to the Mcdonald's brand, I strongly suggest that you send people there to teach them how to run their lines. The people their obviously do not know what they are doing!

REVIEW #9:  1 stars  (450 chars)
So your probably wondering, why would anyone bother to yelp a McDonald's.  I'll tell you why! I love Mickey D chicken nuggets, and as often as I eat them, I have never been to a McDonald's before that told me they are out of Sweet & Sour sauce!!!  Seriously it's like WTF! How do you run out of Sweet & Sour sauce!!!  With the amount of preservatives in it, I don't think the stuff ever expires, so you should have a crate of it in back just in case!

This review is strictly for the wacker than wack McDonalds a.k.a McDONT ...  ... So me and my best girl partied hard one nite n Vegas and as u know all things must cum 2 an end. So after the club we go back to our hotel room which is at the MGM. We stop at the front desk to ask if anything was still open at 4 in da monin. They said yes if u walk to our farmers market (which is kinda far and even farther if u been on your feet all day & all nite in some hills) we have a pizza spot & a McDonalds that's 24hours. I so hat3 McD's so we said we would walk back there for the pizza.  ...  ... So needless to say we get there and both lines are long but McDONT'S is shorter. We both are tired azz h3ll & just want something in our system so we can soak up the liquor & go to bed. So we stand in line for I don't know how long for that nasty azz food get up to the freakin counter to hear we outta food all we have is 5 fishes and 2 chicken. EXCUSE ME !!  ...  ... 1st off ... what the h3ll language r u speakin ? I guess 5 fishes is supposed to be fillet of fish & the 2 chicken with no "s" is supposed to be some kind of chicken sandwich. So 2nd'ly...I get upset bcuz y u did not announce that to everyone standing in line. Were practically standing there 4 no freakin reason. So my girl orders the darn 2 chicken. 3rd...who in the h3ll is managing this place ? How r u gonna b open 24hrs and DON'T have any food ? Just freakin turn the lights off at 10pm y don't u !!! ...  ... So now were on the long walk back to the room. We get there kick our shoes off get comfy open up our 2 chicken and WOW... bread...mayo...chicken. WHERE THE H3LL IS MY LETTUCE ? WHERE IS MY TOMATOES ? So now I am forced to eat this dry azz sandwich no fries to go with it ( thats the only thing i eat at McDont's is there addictive french fries) and some left over water from the club cuz oh yes...these fools didnt have any beverages either. ...  ... Can some 1 help me understand how a fast food chain that claim they sold over a billion hamburgers and so forth run out of food...IN VEGAS...@ THE MGM GRAND who has bookoo money. ...  ... So the next nite U know we had to do it all over again but this time we went straight to the pizza spot. I told the pizza man what happened the night b4 and he said  "IT'S ALWAYS LIKE THAT, THEY SHUT DOWN IF THEY RUN OUT OF KETCHUP PACKAGES" ...  ... In an event of a late night... DO NOT GO 2 MCDONT'S !!!!! U will b HIGHLY upset ! ...  ... 0.0 stars...They deserve 100 rocks thrown @ em

You got lucky being right near the start line at 6:15am when it was 30 degrees out, the line at Starbucks was a mile long, and my friend and I have this tradition of getting your egg mcmuffins at each race since the San Diego Rock 'n' Roll marathon.   ...  ... We woke up extra early, braved the elements, and you were wonderfully warm.  We decided we would stay inside that blanket of heat until the start of the race.  It turns out everyone else had the same idea but the lines moved fast.  Wow!  How is that possible?  Oh, you anticipated this so you have egg mcmuffins all ready to go as well as coffee and juice.  You made them the night before?  How good can they possibly be?   ...  ... I order mine without sausage and your employee freaks out.  He tells me they're already made and if I could just take the sausage out.  I give him a look and say I want it made fresh.  He consults with another employee and ultimately the manager and they agree that I should get a fresh egg mcmuffin.  Gee, thanks.  Also, what's with the $7 price tag?  Did you raise the prices the night before the marathon?  I've never paid that much for a combo meal.  You're supposed to be the cheap breakfast option. ...  ... I get my supposed fresh egg mcmuffin and notice it's not so fresh.  The cheese is burnt as well as the muffin and there's sausage residue on my muffin.  How did that happen?  My juice is warm because you left it out in anticipation of a rush.   ...  ... Next marathon, I won't be coming back.  I'll buy muffins somewhere the night before and just make do.

I've been rather disappointed in the McD's I've been stopping in lately, and I remember this being a total dive years ago. Came in for sodas-the staff is nice, the place is clean; then my cousin and I were very impressed at how well the team was communicating with each other.

I really enjoy this location of the McDonalds. There are a few problems I have with it though. I have asked for water (this was twice within a fifteen minute period) and never received it. When I ordered three chocolate sundaes, they had no problem getting them to me! Just don't ask for something like water. There are also a lot of bums that hang out in there and it can become unsafe for kids. For the most part, John (the main manager) will drive them out of there after awhile. There are also a lot of teenagers which can become somewhat unruly. It is not in the greatest area, but it is actually a good location. The quality of the food seems great though...

The kid won't eat at Del Taco, so it's a two-stop lunch.  Fine.   ...  ... Ordered easily in the drive-thru, tended prompted to my a young woman with dual eyebrows (unusual, but not bad: the original set, and a second pair penciled about an inch higher; interesting look), and out the door again. ...  ... The girl toy in the kid's meal was a decorate-yourself little generic Hot Wheels car, but she's a tomboy and loves stickers, so no harm, no foul.

REVIEW #6:  4 stars  (436 chars)
Yesterday I was starving so I stopped by here for a Southwest salad. To my surprise, this salad was full of fresh romaine lettuce and warm moist strips of pretty tasty chicken. This salad has only 450 calories which is a huge plus. They have two other types of salad for even less calories, but I bet they aren't as tasty as this one. I highly recommend going to McDonald for a last minute salad instead of the Taco Bell's Cantina bowl.

We stopped by last night to check out the McRib so this review is for that. I can honestly say that the McRib is McGross. The sauce cloyingly sweet, the meat had the texture of a sponge and after a couple bites I threw it out. Im not quite sure that the big deal is about with this sandwich. I do remember having one as a kid but like Twinkies somethings just taste better when you're young.  ...  ... The staff here was really friendly and while the sandwich was gross, it was served hot and fresh.

Good morning, this morning before 730am myself and my fiance went to this mcdonalds drive-thru placed an order and left. We went to go wash when my fiance discovered a counterfiet $50 bill when he went back in his wallet with the receipt that was handed to us from the cashier that was working at this time. We made a first trip back to let the working manager there Chris told us"no this is real" we explained to him the money was to thick and it just didn't seem right. When he told us"oh no its real you see the face, its real" we went back to the laundrymat finished up our loads to wash made one more errund to a dollar general and then made a last stop at our local friendly speedeemart. I went into the store and try to purchase a few items. When I gave this same bill that we recived from this mcdonalds to the clerk as soon as she touched it she said to me"sweety this is not real" she advice me to put it in a slot machine if it spits it out its not real, I did this twice, only because I don't gamble and I was furious we made a third trip back spoke to another manager buy the name of John. He tried to tell us he can't verify what happened. Once we told him we were calling the police both the drivethru cashier and the manager chris who told us this bill was real left immediately together. I rarely I mean rarely eat out but I will not go to this location or any other location for this exact reason. My fiance is a porter and i am a Dental Assistant we are hard working honest people. I will be filing a report first thing Tuesday morning since it is a holiday tomorrow. Watch your currency please oh by the way the store number is#975 address 3815 south maryland prkway las vegas nevada 89109. Thank you and be aware of your ... transactions ...  Kelvin and Phaedra!

The new McDonald's carries on with the modern designs of their current restaurants in and out of Las Vegas. The drink refill stations are easily accessible. ...  ... Nice seating throughout including booths, round tables, leather chairs around circular tables, and pub style high stools. There are several LCD screen TV's inside to catch a sporting event or news. ...  ... Glass is used to separate areas of the restaurant while simultaneously allowing for a open feel. The overly sized and low hanging chandelier creates a center focus to this slightly smaller square footage restaurant. There is no play place for kids. ...  ... The LCD ordering screens are cool and add to the futuristic theme. I will be back because Blue Diamond Road is highly accessible from the I-15 freeway in both directions.

Food is what you expect from mcds. But the service is horrible. I had bought lots food. They handed me a handful of ketchup. But when I asked for another sauce, like ranch or sweet n sour. They only gave me one packet. Then they said they charge 25 cents for any extra packets. Mcds has become greedy. After spending like 15 dollars on food. They wanna charge for sauce. Screw them. Ill go to jacks where they give you any amount of sauce you want for free.

@McDonalds #34841 change over #disaster arrive at 10:32 to order breakfast #NO, lunch order placed at 10:38 got order at 10:54. HORRIBLE!!! ...  ... Try to get breakfast at 10:31am on a Sunday. Good luck.  ...  ... They will not give you your drink cup while you are waiting. They tell you it will come out with the order.  ...  ... Service staff ignore customers at the counter. One disgruntled family was so frustrated on their order not getting delivered that they wanted a refund. The cashier ignored them which infuriated them more. When the cashier finally acknowledged them it got worse. They had two receipts (around $27 worth of food) and the cashier kept trying to total them both to give them their money back and she could not get the right number which upset the guest more. Advice to the cashier: Refund one receipt at a time. (No Math Involved) ...  ... This is a beautiful McDonalds but the staff is NOT FRIENDLY, POLITE or COURTEOUS. How about the friendly greeting that other McDonalds do and a wave or Thank You when you leave. Recommend that you dismantle this team and start from scratch because they obviously were never taught or forgot the core values of McDonalds corporation.

Day and time of incident: Sunday, April 6, 2014 - 10:40am. ...  ... I'll make it brief.. ordered food, 20 minutes later, still no food. Hungry, want to get on the road asap. Decided instead of arguing for food to get refund and head across the street to In N Out. (Should of been first choice, shot my own foot!) *sigh* ...  ... Not exactly sure who is at fault here, whether management or employee. ...  ...   Apparently this female employee did not have the competence to add up my order and refund my money.. maybe if she was a teenager, that would of been excusable. ...   As she was pushing buttons on the monitor and looking back and forth at my receipt, she started twitching and looked liked the monitor was a ticking time bomb from how fast she was going trying to disable it from blowing her into smithereens. After a few unfortunate attempts and still unable to add up the order to the equivalent price for refund, she jumped, panicked, starting speaking gibberish and then turned around and left to the back of the kitchen. ...  ... Extremely disrespectful leaving us there and would say unprofessional of her but then again, not sure if her (just assuming) G.E.D or high school diploma even covered that term. Which then points to management and the kind of training they provide to their employees. ... Poor lady, sure do feel sorry for her. Supervisor gave me my refund, ate a delicious burger from In N Out, drove back to California. ...  ... Customer Service = ZERO stars. ...  ...

I stayed in the Luxor and it was very convenient to stop by this McDonald's and grab something. Sometimes the lines looked long but they went by quickly...I never waited longer than 3 or 4 minutes. They never asked to see my receipt for a refill...so maybe that rule that is mentioned in other reviews has changed. My only quarrel is that there isn't a refill machine as there are in other food courts.

This McDonalds was a freaking life saver when my girlfriend and I arrived and checked-in to Luxor at 1 AM! ...  ... Service at night was suuuper slow... not sure if its all the drunk people ordering that made it slow or they were understaffed, but that 10 minute wait seemed like 30.  ...  ... Came back 8 hours later for breakfast and I swear everything changed and my order was literally done within 20 seconds of me actually placing my order! Un-freaking-believable.  ...  ... Anyway, for the price... you get what you pay for. Inside your Luxor coupon booklet, you will find savings you can use for a few items... so use them wisely.

If I was writing this review a couple of weeks previous, I'd be saying that eating in this Mcdonalds is kind of like eating in a Disneyfied Egypt. In Vegas, things change fast within a couple of weeks. As I write this, the Luxor food court and it's McDonalds are being remodeled. Gone is the Disneyfied Egypt environment, and the unique environment of this Mcdonalds and food court. When I looked at the diagram of the remodel (there is a picture I took of it for the review), it shows a design looks more like the Aria than Egypt. Hopefully this not going to be a further de-theming of the Luxor. It is still a special Mcdonalds, being that it is the one and only McDonalds in a pyramid. As far as seating, the beginning stages of the remodel seem to have added more. ...    Focusing on the McDonalds, it is usually busy. But the lines move fast. A couple of months previous, I would write that the prices are inflated. Nowadays it seems that the majority of McDonalds have raised their prices. However this location does not offer the $1 deal on all size cold beverages. ...   An interesting fact is that both this and the Excalibur McDonalds serve Pepsi beverages in lieu of Coke beverages. ...   There is a high chance of me returning here. It is convenient when I hang out on the South Strip. I am also curious what it will look like after the remodel.

Only one refill is offered and the receipt is needed. Usually, there is a line for ordering but getting the order is somewhat quick. Typically, if it is a busy, the ordering process takes a while. Plenty of seating around inside of the Luxor food court area. No WiFi offered from this location.

REVIEW #6:  2 stars  (289 chars)
After 2am the wait was horrible! Roughly about 20 minutes waiting to order, then another 10 minutes waiting for food that you would expect to be hot and fresh with the wait...nope! Light heated floppy fries, and almost stale chicken nuggets. Even the McDouble was warm (not fresh and hot).

REVIEW #7:  2 stars  (2498 chars)
Although I am not a huge fan of chain fast food places, I do have to admit that I am addicted to McDonald's fries.  This place is your typical cheap fast food / food court eatery inside of a casino, so don't expect much.  Actually, it's a little worse than usual ...  ... Food:  Typical menu for McDonalds with your burger and fries combo meals.  I typically get a #2 (two cheese burgers) with a large order of fries and a Coke.  Burgers were what to be expected; really skinny, sloppily put together, a little bit on the salty side and lukewarm. Fries were about the same, not very fresh and lukewarm in temperature.  The worst part of the meal was the drink.  McDonalds from around the world have always carried Coke products, so I was hugely disappointed when the cashier told me "we don't have Coke, is Pepsi ok?"  I was in shock, and almost offended by this.  I'm not one of those "love Coke, hate Pepsi" crazy type of people.  I actually never drink soda, but when I splurge for fast food and get McDonalds I always get a Coke to drink.  Pepsi just does not taste the same with my fries.  I got a Dr. Pepper instead to drink and it just tasted wrong.  ...  ... Price:  Although the prices are a dollar or 2 higher than non-casino locations, McDonalds is still a cheap option for a quick bite to eat.  Their dollar menu is more like a "$2" menu, and their combo meals are still a good price considering that the food will fill you up. ...  ... Atmosphere:  This McDonalds is on the second story food court of the Excalibur casino.  There are a lot of other fast food choices there, and a lot of available seating all over the place.  You go up to the order counter, place you order, pay, and wait for your number to be called.  Drinks are self-service.  The seating area within the designated McDonalds area was a bit direct and crowded, but if you don't mind walking your tray around you can find much cleaning seating in the middle of the food court area. ...  ... Staff / Service:  Typical fast food cashiers.  Not much of a smile from them.  They punch in your order and hand you area receipt.  The food staff were running around and yelling at each other in the back, but again this is typical for McDonalds. ...   ... Overall, this place isn't really good, but it's not extraordinarily bad either.  Food could be warmer, staff could be friendlier, but it is a fast food chain so you can't expect too much.  They only have Pepsi drinks, so if you go in prepared for that you should be ok.

dont call my order number if you still haven't bagged my food yet, make eye contact with me, then let me stand there literally for a few minutes while you continue to prep and call out other orders.  ...  ... all i wanted was a 20 pc w/o the 15 minute wait and the attitude after i asked for sauce.

REVIEW #9:  2 stars  (161 chars)
McDonalds inside the Luxor food court. All the food was over priced vs typical McDonalds. The fries were soggy and limp instead of their usual golden cripsyness.

REVIEW #10:  1 stars  (427 chars)
Horrible service- people that work here look like they hate their Job and their customers. Pick-up system is very disorganized.  ... The first time I went they forgot my drink. My boyfriend asked for it and the manager  looked offended and took a while to give us my drink. Didn't even apologize.  The second time they forgot my yogurt parfait. I didn't realize it until we got back to our hotel room.  ... Awful, awful, awful.

REVIEW #11:  1 stars  (848 chars)
I don't usually review fast food 'restaurants' but I had to say something about this McDonald's. We came here twice, based upon convenience alone, and it was a train wreck.  ...  ... First of all, what is up with the ordering/pickup organization? When I have to squeeze into the same window as customers ordering, when I'm attempting to pick up a burger, this is a problem. Also, it seemed like the person 'shouting' out order numbers couldn't muster up the enthusiasm to actually call the numbers loud enough for customers to hear, which caused some confusion. ...  ... And to top things off, I was put down for asking for napkins. Apparently, I was s'posed to know that napkins are in the fartherst corner of the food court. Shame on me for not knowing. I deserved the condescending attitude and to be treated like a moron.  ...  ... Never again.

REVIEW #13:  1 stars  (735 chars)
The food was McDonalds, nuff said... My issue was with my cashier. She spoke little English and then she didn't give me the 6.00 portion of my 6.68.  She gave me the change, but no cash.  I looked at her and asked for the rest of my change and she said she gave it to me?!? Uh, no ya didn't...  I told her to look at my purse there is no cash in there... She acted like I was in the wrong.. She calls her manager who comes over and she takes her drawer and counts it in the back office.  Okay, so my food is sitting on the counter getting cold.  After about 10 mins the manger comes over and hands me $6.00 no I am sorry, thank you...nothing! The manger said to the cashier, it was $6 over... Thanks for the cold fries and aggravation!

REVIEW #14:  1 stars  (1241 chars)
This McDonalds is located inside of the Luxor food court. We visited at around 2:45am after a night on the town. Seemed convenient enough. We were so wrong. It took an hour for us to get our food! We didn't eat until 3:45!  ...  ... The ordering line moves relatively fast. Then you wait for the short handed staff to take their sweet time making your food incorrectly (like my bacon quarter pounder with no freaking bacon!), only to have it ready after the five people behind you already got their food. Then you get to pick it up with the soda that they filled up for you at the time of your order. Warm, flat, iced down soda just goes so well with every meal, doesn't it? ...  ... Everyone waiting looked super frustrated. They really need to beef up their night team... no joke. I know most of the clientele at that time of night are stumbling drunks, but we are still paying customers and probably the MOST eager to get our food and run back to our hotels. Better service is deserved!  ...  ... Unfortunately the guy who passed out at the table while waiting for his food probably never even got his meal. He will only leave with memories of waking up in a random food court. Tears. ...  ... Ronald, for real, get it together over here!

Fast service & food. They have quick daytime drive through staff. Have been coming here for about a year and a half. Sometimes the WiFi works, which is always nice, if you're inside. The free drink refills are good, as some places inside of casinos, charge the entire price for a refill. It is conveniently located across the street from Mandalay Bay and is frequented by people who work on the strip, so you know it's easy to deal with.

The cashier wearing the name tag Michaelangelo was an outstanding employee. I went in with the intention of buying a BigMac meal large size and the smallest size order of chicken nuggets. He SOLD me and said that the smallest mcnugget (4 piece) was approx 2.99 and that for a few more bucks I could get a 20 piece. Point taken and I got both the meal and 20 mcnuggets. The drink area was in a disarray but he went out of his way to make sure everything was back up to standards. (I was observing this while I was eating my food order). Overall great experience

Funny, Las Vegas has a few ChicDonald's haha! They have nice furnishings inside - unlike most McDonald's in Los Angeles. Does the food taste better? No, but I have heard that they tried to sell pizza at Vegas McDonald's.... Unsuccessfully of course, but still - very interesting! ...  ... We were here very, very early in the morning and there was no one manning the registers but the manager was walking by checking them. She looked around when she saw us to see if she could get someone to at least greet us but there was no one so she had to do it herself haha! When one of her drones heard her greeting we finally got our order taken. ...  ... The food was as "good" as at any McD's and they did not mess up our order. ...  ... It was very early in the morning granted, but still, many tables were dirty - no excuses!  ...  ... It may be a ChicDonald's but it merits only three stars anyway.

Convenient. Hit this place up on our way outta town for the standard hang over breakfast faire. ...  ... The lady at the drive through window gave us the stink eye and then yelled at us after she took off her headset for dumping about an ounce of water out of a cup we had in the cup holder from a few days before. ...  ... Really lady? Got your panties all in a super twist over an ounce of water that evaporated off the hot black top. Get over it.

I work in the area so have eaten at this location numerous times. ...  ... The location is right across from the Mandalay Bay. ...  ... The staff at this location changes constantly. But no matter how often the staff changes you can always count on them being inept.  ...  ... If you have to eat here I'd suggest walking inside. The drive through is always a long wait. ...  ... The food is typical McDonalds except for their french fries. At most McDonalds I love their fries...not at this place. They're always old and it taste as if they never change the oil in their fryer.  I've never had a good french fry at this place. ...  ... If you're really craving McDonalds I'd suggest you try another one.

I get that there can be miscommunication over the drive thru window but come on now.. We're ASKING a question, stop assuming we're ordering, especially when we preface our question with "I have a question."  We asked if they had the meal that comes with 2 mcmuffins. She put in an order for 2 sandwiches only.  We say no that's not what we want to order we want to know if you have the meal. She takes it off and adds milk instead. Frustrated, we just ordered two number 2s with orange juice. ... No apologies for the miscommunication she just gives a total and stops talking.  We had to wait til we got to her to find out of she got the order correct (no milk or any other random items).  All was fine but her attitude was not. we could not wait to move on to the next window.  But alas, the car in front was waiting for their order for forever!   ...  ... We finally make it to the food window and I tell my bf to ask for ketchup.  Window opens  and lady serving us our bags was nice and at least days good morning.  But then she hands us our bag and our drinks and says no straws (for our orange juices) and closes the window.  We could barely say "ketchup please!"  Thank god she heard as the window was closing.   ...  ... WTF store #22506.  McDonald's, this is UNSATISFACTORY.  No straws (and heard the cashier tell another customer that there were no frappes), bad attitude and horrible service! From all the reviews I've read for this location your management needs to step it up.  I know I will take my business elsewhere than this establishment.. Next time I'll just hit up Winchells next door.

This is seriously the worst drive thru in las vegas. I live nearby and go here often, out of convenience. They forget everything and mess up even the simplest tasks. The other day, they gave me a burger without a burger in it. It was just a bun with onions and cheese. I brought it back and the guy doesn't even apologize, just throws me another one and laughs. I get that it's kind of a funny mistake, but these stoner kids working there don't give a shit that you had to drive all the way back to get a new one.  ...  ... The lady who takes orders on most days is a total b*tch, too. Everything she says just comes off as super aggressive and rude.

I've been coming to this McDonalds for awhile now, though I don't go at 130 due to the obnoxious high school kids. But now there is a new owner and it seems as if he doesn't tolerate the loitering which I am so thankful for. I can actually bring in my toddler and not worry about what she's going to hear or see! This location is also extremely clean

Not sure why this McDonald's is showing as closed. It is connected to the Terrible's gas station and still in business. They have a 24 hour drive-thru as well. ...  ... I have never been inside, only ordered at the drive-thru. The employees are pretty friendly, they have fast service, and no problems with my orders so far.  I love the $1 large sweet teas!! ...  ... I moved to the area a few weeks ago and have driven by here before, but could not remember if I saw a sign saying that they had a 24 hour drive-thru. So the first time I came here, I asked the cashier at the first window: ...  ... Me: Is your drive-thru 24 hours? ... Employee: Ummm...... I think so? But I'm not sure. Do you want me to ask?  ... Me: That's okay, I'll ask at the next window. ...  ... LOL he works there and didn't know what their drive-thru hours were?!?! Come on!! Well, as I drove up to the second window to get my food, I saw the 24 hour sign.  ...  ... But still, as an employee, you should at least know what the restaurant's hours are right??

I stopped here to use the Redbox machine.  I then went inside and got a McDonald's McCaf frapp, chocolate chip variety. ...  ... Service was prompt with a nice smile from the young lady at the counter.  She made the drink quickly and it was very good.  I've been here a few times in the past and it's a convenient stop on Flamingo.

My mom needed to meet a client to pick up documents and I was her chauffeur for the day. The lobby is really nice, as is all their locations in the Southwest that I've been to, due to recent renovations. Very modern, classy, and extremely clean. This location featured an opaque black and white rendition of the Las Vegas Strip on the glass separating the restaurant from Terrible's convenience store. The new digital menus are really nice as well and easy to read.  ...  ... I don't really eat at McDonald's, so I can't say much about the food. What I do usually order and enjoy was their Vanilla Cone. Delicious non-fat vanilla soft serve in a light and crispy cone. The best part of this location is the fact that it is one of the very few corporate stores in the valley and offers the Vanilla Cone at just $0.49 ($0.53 after sales tax)!! What an awesome deal! Especially when franchised locations charge $1 and up. ...  ... So, based on the nice, welcoming lobby and consistently delicious Cone, I have no complaints.  ...  ... BONUS: Free Wi-Fi and the lobby and drive-thru are open 24 hours!

REVIEW #5:  1 stars  (378 chars)
9 times out of 10 the service or food or both are horrible.  After getting my entire order wrong I waited while they made the correct meals.  At home 1 block away my meals were cold, hamburger looked and tasted like yesterdays.  The fries limp and loaded with oil.  If you can not get fresh fries at lunch time, when can you get it.  We will skip this McDonald it never improves

Came here this morning around 2:30-3am with my friends through the drive thru, the guy refused to do two separate orders, was rude about it too, no one was behind us.

I came here to order a big Mac, (hadn't had one in years) and when I got it I kinda noticed it looked like crap so I decided to inspect it. When I did, and I took off the top bun I found that someone took a bite off of my fucking meat Patty!! I mean seriously I always tolerate the crappy service, and the stupid and careless Mexican lady that always takes my orders wrong ( I'm also a Mexican I promise I'm not racist or prejudice) in the mornings at the drive-thru, but c'mon seriously someone took a bite off of my fucking meat Patty!! I took it back to the register, and informed the cashier of my surprise, and he was kind enough to replace it for another Big Mac. I brought it back to my table, and I took it out of it's box, and guess what? It looked like shit! Seriously this thing looked so bad I wouldn't be surprised if it fucking winked at me! It looked as if an elephant had sat on it after it had finished taking a slim dump between two hamburger buns. Okay, now I know McDonalds isn't a five star restaurant, and I definitely know it isn't even a quality restaurant, but can't the customer at least expect some service quality? I mean seriously I couldn't even expect to receive a semi-attractive decent tasting burger or a Big Mac with its Patty as a whole. Ugh.. what can you do right?  GOD BLESS AMERICA

I normally wouldn't write up a chain restaurant, but I have to say my dining experience was very much enhanced by the recent renovation.  They went from a classic drive-in setup where you place your order at the window and dine in your car or in their outdoor seating to a true "McCafe" complete with faux blue chandelier, ultra-modern bathroom doors and interior decor, and bright high definition animated menus which would make Marty McFly (see what I did there?) wonder if he set the wrong year on his Delorean going from his mother Lorraine's time in 1956 to 2016.  There's a service monitor that displays the order number brightly and service was prompt and courteous.  I ordered Le McRib with a side of pomme frites and sweet tea (or as I may one day learn to call it, liquid diabetes) and in a simultaneously comforting and disturbing way, all items tasted identical to how I always remembered them.  Drive-through is very accessible off of Flamingo but if you need to get back heading toward the strip, U-turn is now mandatory off of Eastern.

REVIEW #3:  2 stars  (429 chars)
I'm not sure if it was just a bad day or if it's always been like this, but the service needed some work. Only one register open Witham long line of customers. Orders took really long and many were wrong. One customer returned get order 3 times until they got it right. Those with small orders had to wait am excess amount of time. Seemed as though drive-thru customers were top priority, while customers inside were unimportant.

REVIEW #4:  2 stars  (1951 chars)
It's about time they re-did this place. I mean, how many McDonald's that are out there that are just straight up drive thrus that are wildly popular and successful? None if any.  ...  ... So why this review for a chain? Well, since it's new I wanted to check it out and get my McRib grub on since it only comes around every so often. You would think the service would be nice just like the building but here's where the needle on the record scratches off the vinyl. ...  ... First thing, I get in line behind one person that is waiting to order their food. A couple minutes go by and finally after the just the one counter person calls out somebody's order, he takes the person's order that is in front of me. So after that order, he leaves to go get it ready while I'm standing there waiting to get my order in. Btw, this was lunchtime around 11:30 so there is a line already forming. You would think that there would be at least 2 to 3 people at the counter for the lunch rush but no. This one guy was doing the same thing over and over again. ...  ... So I finish meal and throw away my mess. I go to the bathroom to wash my hands. I come back out to get a refill on my coke. This employee refilling the soda lids asks me if I have my receipt so I can get my refill. I reply saying that I just got done eating and just came from the bathroom. The receipt is in the garbage. He says I can't get a refill. EXCUSE ME? DID YOU NOT JUST SEE ME SITTING AT THE VERY TABLE YOU JUST CLEANED? So I got my refill after the guy says he was gonna report me to his manager. I said go ahead so I can complain about the bad customer service. He just stood there and continued to refill the lids for the soda. I should of said, "Do you know who I am? I am Roger T and I'm a Yelp Elite damnit! You better recognize!" Lol. ...  ... Anyways, just because it's a new building does not equal to great or better service. Next time, just give me my damn McRib and I'm out!

If you're looking for a classy restaurant to take a date; this is the place!  There is ample seating available and the hosts are pleasant.  They even assign numbers to the menu in case you can't pronounce the exotic food names.  I had this dish called a "Big Mac" - thank god for the numbering system because I couldn't pronounce that.   ...  ... My "Big Mac" was served in some sort of box - almost like a broke down Japanese Bento Box. There were two beef patties and a bunch of accoutrements.  It was amazing!  The beef patties had the texture of a bunch of crumpled newspapers - yummy!  The sauce?  Don't get me started on the sauce!  There are no adjectives to accurately describe the deliciousness. ...  ... The best thing about McDonalds?  The fact that I was hungry again three hours later!  It's like you can eat a mountain of food and your body just digests it instantaneously - almost like there's 0 nutritional value.  I would totally recommend this place to a friend!

By far one of the fanciest McDonald's I have ever been in. They had two flat screen TVs, fancy booths and chairs, and an art piece made out of glass.  ...  ... I decided to stop by here for a quick bite to eat. I ordered the McBites...the McBites are not that great, they are way too breaded. I guess I'll just stick to my McNuggets next time.  ...  ... The staff was very friendly and the service was fast.

I stopped here today to get a salad and a shake.  They have a setup for the drive through I've never seen before.  Because of the limited driveway space, the entrance splits into two drives, both of which have ordering areas.  This allows the cars to get into the drive through section quicker and not block traffic in the shopping center. ...  ... Service was fast and polite, and the wait for the food was minimal.  They have free wifi at this location and I saw a sign about two nights of jazz by a live singer in their McCaf on two nights in December.  I wish I could make one of the nights just to try it out.  Sounds like fun! ...  ... Since this is a new McDonald's that opened within the past few months and it's only about 2 miles from home, I'll be stopping at this location more often.  Way to go, McDonald's staff!

I'm a HUGE fan of McDonald's period, (yea I know it's sad, lol) but I very much enjoy coming to this location because it's clean and modern. Love the decor. Came a few days ago to order a happy meal for my daughter and OMG! I loved the Wizard of Oz toys, sooo adorable. Anyways, all I ordered was the pumpkin pie which I was not to fond of, the apple pie is way better and the PSL. The PSL was way too sweet even with the nonfat milk but my biggest thing was that they couldn't even fill it to the top!!. Either way, I know I'll be back, may not be for their PSL but definitely for the food.  :-)

So I felt like being naughty and getting a cheese burger, however, once I looked at the menu I saw they had a wrap and thought to myself "humm a wrap sounds good."  ... So that is exactly what I got. I remember years ago they had those snack wraps and that is what I was expecting size wise.  ...  ... They have 3 different kinds chicken bacon ranch, chicken ranch, and a sweet chili one. I opted for the ranch grilled chicken, it had lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, giant pieces of chicken, wrapped in a soft pillowy flour tortilla.  ...  ... FIRST let me say not was I wrong about the size. This thing was MASIVE. I also got the combo so medium fries and a drink. Of course I ate my fries first then dug into the wrap and it wasn't bad, I actually liked it. I could only eat about half of it though because of those stinking fries I was full.  ...  ... I went about a week later and tried the sweet chili one with grilled chicken and like it even more. This time I just got the wrap since there was no need for a combo, I knew it would fill me up. I also really liked the way they boxed up the wrap its in a cool container that  makes it easy to eat.

This is a McCafe location. One of the nicest Mc Donald's I've ever seen. ...  ... I visit this location frequently. I've never been disappointed. ...  ... The Ambiance is awesome! The decor is very modern and artistic. The dining room is always clean, and well stocked with utensils, napkins, ketchup, plastic lids and straws. ...  ... The service has always been good when I've visited. My wife had an issue once, and it was resolved. ...  ... It's in a great location with very easy entrance and exit access. It's near the 215 freeway. ...  ... It's the location I visit the most.

This McDonald's is located at the food side entrance of the Nellis at Craig Walmart Super Center.  ...  At the time that I stopped in Walmart on the way to Utah, I ate breakfast here. This McDonald's exceeded my expectations. I expected a shoddy McDonald's in one of the Las Vegas valley' s older super centers. Instead, I was eating in a clean and surprisingly cozy McDonald's. I am under the impression that it was recently refurbished. The interior shows off McDonald's history through portraits of the first McDonald's. The booths are extraordinary comfortable for  a McDonald's. Disparate from a few Las Vegas Valley Walmart McDonald's, this location offers more breakfast items. Including the egg McMuffin. ...   On my visit, they served me the egg McMahon meal in a short period of time. The coffee was hot. And I left satisfied. ...   Keep in mind that I ate here around 9:45 AM, before the Saturday morning rush. So, I have not seen how this McDonald's is when there is a rush of people.

REVIEW #3:  1 stars  (408 chars)
No, just no. I understand that the food I order will never ever come out like it looks in the picture, but gadaam, don't mean you gotta give me burnt buns on both my mcdoubles. Women, I told you no pickles.. and what did I get?? Probably the largest slices in the bunch. Now I get it's  morning... your tired.. well I'm tired too! When I say good morning at the window I expect some kinda of acknowledgement.

This is a large, relatively modern-looking mcds. Its a bit grimy, which in mho, kind of defeats the purpose of the remodel. Why bother making it all pretty & modern if youre not going to wipe it down regularly? ...  ... The service here is ok. Food is standard mcds fare.  ...  ... The one reason we come here is for the HUGE four-story play area. The kids enjoy exploring it, and i enjoy getting a half hour of sanity.  theres a small space underneath for littler guys to play in, but this playplace is realistically more for older kids who can climb well.  ...  ... The kids room is completely closed off from the rest of the restaurant, which works great at keeping my boys from running off, and theres a separate bathroom in here just for aparents.  No changing table, which for some strange reason seems to be the way las vegas restaurants roll. I really hate that.  ...  ... Therefore they shouldnt be surprised when i change a poopy diaper on one of their posh bench seats since theres nowhere else to do it. ... Maybe then they'll wipe it down afterwards... But dont count on it.

Alright, so the service here is sometimes good or bad just like any other place. It's pretty clean and has nice air conditioning. What bothers me about this location are some of the employees. They really need to learn proper etiquette... not only for others, but for themselves too. You won't get far ahead in life if you treat people rudely... They're so lucky to have employed that one lady.. She's a new face there and she has such good manners. Also this other employee was super nice too. I went to get some coffee in the morning and it was pretty crowded. The lady was calm and so friendly, idk how she was able to keep a big smile on her face on such a busy day. But overall, most of the employees there just need to learn proper etiquette and not fake it. AND ALSO, I forgot to mention this major thing.. Always check if your order is all good and you have everything. They tend to mess up your orders and forget things.. And they don't even apologize. Rude. ...  ... Like this one time they messed up my order and I was the only customer there....

REVIEW #3:  2 stars  (1056 chars)
This place is terrible. It's a 50/50 chance that they will get your order right. Maybe if they could hire people who spoke a word of English, they would get your orders right. ...  ... I was JUST there. I wanted a coffee with no whip cream and extra caramel. Super easy, right? Apparently not. They put extra whip cream, barely any caramel. I paid extra for it, so I asked them to remake it. The girl did, but tried to give it to me with, again, barely any caramel. I explained that I asked for extra and even paid extra. She got an attitude with me, then walked away. Another girl asked her what she was going and said, "MORE f***ing caramel!?"  ...  ... So sure as shit, the girl had to be a smart ass and put as much caramel as she could. Literally, the entire bottom was filled half an inch up of caramel. I couldn't help but laugh. What an immature and ignorant staff. I will never go here again. This place is a complete dump. I will definitely be contacting the district manager, because the manager here is a joke and doesn't take anything serious.

I can't believe no one has mentioned the African decor in this McDonald's.  It's different and wacky and I kind of love it.  Star! ...  ...

Other than that, it's McDonald's, so what do you expect? ...  ... I haven't eaten at a McDonald's in a long time, so I was kind of surprised how hard it is to read the menu.  What with all the new menu options and having to show calories and pictures, there is too much info to fit on the board.  I felt like I needed to sit down with a paper menu to take it all in.

yuck.......Is it me or has McDonalds food gotten smaller & grosser? ... I saw they had the McRib making a limited time comeback so I was feeling all nostalgic and thought I'd give it a go. ...  ... Big mistake..worse than any school lunch pork patty-by the 3rd bite I was already nauseous. How does McDonalds stay open the food is sooo terrible and its not even cheap anymore. ...  ... Do quality food establishment have to have a drive-thru because people have gotten so lazy they will eat any damn thing as long as they don't have to get off their asses to do it.

REVIEW #3:  1 stars  (5040 chars)
It's 2 for 1 review day!  I can't review the Walmart without reviewing the McDonald's that resides inside.  And boy is it some tantalizing stuff. ...  ... I try not to give too many 1-star reviews but this McDonald's so deserves it.  I hardly frequent a McDonald's at all (although this is my second McDonald's review in less than a week) but I need to let the peeps in on this one.  No Yelper should go unwarned.   ...  ... Of course I came to McDonald's since I have those coupons for their new contraption, the McWrap.  Which when I pronounce very fast and in my Scottish accent sounds much like 'McCrap'.  After my second go round with this thing, I have made up my mind it is decidedly so.  I need to write McDonald's execs to change the name on this thing immediately. ...  ... My coupon for the day was buy a medium fries and a medium drink, get a McWrap of your choice for FREE.  I have a hard time resisting free.  I'm here to tell you...WORST ALMOST FREE MEAL OF MY LIFE!!!  Seriously. ...  ... It was the tail end of lunchtime so the line was still a bit busy.  I patiently waited for almost 10 minutes...which is like forever in McDonald's time.  At least two folks left the line while I was there.  I know it's not McDonald's fault, but the couple in front of me took up majority of the line space because they were in motorized wheelchairs.  And they were very loud.  This doesn't bother me much.  But...they were also very stinky.  Yes, stinky.  I have no problem with stinky in most cases (I occasionally help the homeless so I know) but the guy in front of me hadn't washed in DAYS if I were to guess.  To each his own, and I know it's almost summer so I know we all want to save water...but DAMN.  If I get a whiff and I have to take a step back?  You might be S-T-I-N-K-Y.  But who am I to judge?  I took a big step back and waited my turn.  Free is the motivation here.  I finally get up there to the McDonald's cashier and present my coupon to the guy.  He takes a look at it and says 'We don't usually take the promo coupons at this location but we'll let you use it."  Then he proceeds to put the coupon onto a stack of...more coupons!  Mind boggling to say the least.  He takes my order of a medium fries and medium drink, asks me what type of McWrap I want (Grilled Chicken & Bacon) and rings me up.  $2.91 later I'm given my receipt and asked to wait for my number to be called. ...  ... I wait.  And wait.  #1!  #2!  #3!  #5!  #6!  #7!  #8!  Obviously I'm #4 and 10 minutes later I am still waiting.  Honestly, what the Hell are you guys doing back there?  Mixing the masa for my fresh pressed tortilla?  Feathering a chicken?  Perhaps ripening a tomato?  I ask the McDonald's runner and he tells me, "We're waiting for your McWrap."  Of course. ...  ... At this point I'm almost running late to be back at work, so the minute I get my order I bolt back to the office and have lunch at my desk.  Thankfully I'm only three minutes away.  I really, really should have just gone to the vending machine or eaten my stash of Reese's chocolate peanut butter eggs from last Easter.  Talk about disappointment!  I take out my McWrap from my bag and lay down the box of fries on my desk.  I continue working while munching away on what is supposed to be McDonald's claim to fame.  Their golden fries.  I bite into one, eh a bit stale.  I bit into another one, eh not enough salt.  I bite into yet another one, eh cold??  I look down, and whaddaya know?  My damn fry is not even barely cooked!  White like Olivia Wilde in the winter.  I look through the entire box and find at least half a dozen fries not cooked properly!  Not golden brown!  Not delicious!  Barely out of their frozen state, and just limp.  Not acceptable!  Please check my pic for proof of this travesty.  McDonald's not doing their fries right is like IKEA not serving their Swedish Meatballs with gravy.  NO BUENO. ...  ... After getting over this somewhat I finally hit my stride to go on to my Grilled Chicken & Bacon McWrap.  Wow, talk about lightning striking twice.  This thing was lifeless!  After unwrapping this beast (the box is still the best part about this McWrap), I could just tell something was off.  Tortilla was already showing signs of being soggy way too long.  The chicken peeking out of the top was not looking tip top shape either.  After some hesitation, I took a bite.  UGH I say, UGH!  Freshness was not part of the gameplan for this McDonald's today.  All cold and soggy!  And upon all, my McWrap wasn't built correctly!  Instead of having Spring Mix like it's supposed to, there was plain old shredded iceberg lettuce!  And my bacon was missing!  In the words of our Lord Darth Vader....NOOOOOOOO!  It was McCrap through & through.  Totally upset over this one.  I have picture proof of this travesty of gourmet eats as well.   ...  ... McDonald's you have pissed off the wrong fatty.  I will definitely be calling your hotline to complain about this one for sure.  Knowing my luck I'll get a coupon for a free McWrap.  CRAP.

REVIEW #3:  4 stars  (1201 chars)
I know you are probably wondering how a McDonald's can get a four star rating and to be quite honest I'm thinking the same thing. However, I will explain. I've been here numerous times, as it is convenient and an easy way to grab a quick meal or pretty good iced coffee. Usually there is a lenghty line at the drive through, but it always seems to go quick. Our lastest visit was no exception. After getting a sample of the Mighty Wings earlier in the day, I had made up my mind early to grab some for dinner. I was simply amazed, as they were much better than I could ever have imagined. A three piece will cost you three bucks, but they get less expensive as you buy in bigger quantity. When we got to the window, we were asked to pull off to the side, as the wings were not done yet. We waited only a short time before our wings came out hot and fresh. We were given a coupon for a free order of fries on our next visit, as a result of having to wait. They have offered a coupon every time we have had to wait, which cannot be said for other establishments. I would highly recommend the Mighty Wings and give high praise to my local Mickey D's for the fast, friendly service during the dinner rush.

This location is close to the local University and has sliding glass entrance doors. This is a highly frequented location, but for some reason it doesn't get the location service love. ...  ...

It's a Mc Donalds in a theorhetically good location, but getting into the driveway is awkward. The food isn't exceptional in the realm of MCDs and the two speed mountains when leaving the drive through are minor foibles. But what bums me out is the fries. This location never seems to have (and/or give me) fresh fries. Its amazing how the degredation of a McDonalds french fry goes so quickly from delicious wonder,  to cake candle garbage in minutes. Meh.

REVIEW #5:  1 stars  (727 chars)
I gave it 1 star for their service. I was there around 6 a.m. and not very busy at all. I ordered 2 breakfast sandwiches at the intercom and by the time I got to the window I decided I wanted to add drinks as well. The guy at the window gave off an attitude and said for future reference place your complete order back there. I said I'm sorry, I didn't want drinks originally but decided on it when I got to the window, besides I'm paying for them. He repeated himself again, for future reference place your order back there. What would you do? Would you have stuck around? 'Cuz I didn't. Good thing I didn't give him my money. I wonder what the owner would think if he knew he lost a sale and maybe more since I'm telling you?

REVIEW #6:  1 stars  (653 chars)
Ordered at the drive through, heard the lady take my order correctly and even say out loud to the food preparers the order. Got my order and it was incorrect. Went inside and asked for my order to be fixed. As I waited there was a guy standing next to me also waiting for an order to be fixed. He got his and walked away shaking his head. I then heard the cashier tell the manager, "man, customers today..." That's when I then decided to say i just wanted my money back. Very unprofessional. As I walked away from it all I realized he didn't even give me the correct change back. He shorted me $0.65. Never going back and will be calling the higher ups.

REVIEW #7:  1 stars  (442 chars)
The manager during the shift this morning seemed rather rude to one of his employees, an older man who looked like he was still learning, and the manager had little to no patience, constantly snapped at him and was also rushing ME to the point where I felt uncomfortable even asking for ketchup. And I was only given ONE napkin inside my utensil packet. Only came here because it's right beside the school, otherwise, I'd have gone elsewhere.

This McDonald's is super clean and cozy since they did a complete renovation inside and out. Normally I would not take the time out to complete a Yelp review for this establishment however this location is really nice! It has that College lounge relaxing atmosphere that is welcoming for students and all who want some chill time. Nice comfy cushy black pleather chairs and small intimate tables, colorful art on the walls, easy to relax, eat, study, or use their wi-fi for Internet access. ...  ... All you can drink serve yourself fountain drinks are always a plus at McDonald's! The only thing is they do not keep the fresh brewed iced tea or sweet tea out like other locations do so you will have to ask for refills on that.  ...  ... The food is good and the staff is fast and ready to go with your order!

it's a toss up for this location and the one on the strip across from four seasons for worst McDonald's. every time I come to this location no matter what I order a large order for three or just a ice cream cone the wait time is horrible. sometimes you'll pull up to the speaker and it takes forever for someone to say anything and start taking your order. there's prob one or two workers in drive thru that do a ok job. I've had my order messed up here multiple times also

REVIEW #7:  2 stars  (791 chars)
Mediocre at best. Quality of service is so mundane and unprofessional. I always come in to study since this McDonald's  seems like a nice and quiet place to study after-hours, but the associates here are loud, and sometimes get out of hand. You tend to overhear all the at-work drama and complaints of the workers.  ...  ... It's barely midnight and they apparently shut off their ice cream machine and don't tell you until you're ready to pay. Seriously, what McDonald's has their ice cream machine shut off? Oh and my apple pie was cold AF from sitting too long and previously over-browned from baking too long. How do they manage to do that?! ...  ... Two stars for having guests feel awkward during their dine-in and two stars for their inadequate system of delivering less than ok food.

There was 1 lady wearing a blue shirt who seemed to be doing EVERYTHING even though there were other employees working, she was the ONLY one with a sense of urgency to help guests!   English in here is a foreign language even in front of guests, they don't care.  The only bright spot to this place in the morning is the lady wearing blue and other times a very nice black man who came in at 6am, he is always pleasant and courteous.   NOBODY ELSE SEEMS TO GIVE A DAMN!!!

Wow never in a million years o would think I'll review a McDonald's BUT I had such a horrible experience at this very particular location literally few hours ago (07/28 12:10am-12:50am) when trying to order through the drive-thru, it fckn took them almost a fckn hour! I left before I even had a chance to order, I got so fed up and even 2 cars behind us left as well. What's even more frustrating is the idiot at the very last window (where u were supposed to make an order) was just casually talking to the first car in front of us for nearly 45 min, NOT even bothering to tell us whether there was something wrong because the wait was just too fckn long! Fck ur terrible service!!!

When I am not near a Starbucks I like to come here sometimes for their iced coffee, they have never got my order right and never been compelled to fix my order or give me a refund . One day me and hubby were in a rush in the morning and grabbed " breakfast " when we got Into the car we look inside of our bag and we have all lunch items. We go back inside to correct our order and we are informed that breakfast is over and there is nothing they can do. They proceeded to take our name down and told us we could grab free breakfast the next day. Next morning comes around and we go to get our breakfast. We are told that our names are not in the book and again there's nothing they can do !? I mean it's mcdonalds but please have some pride in what you do!?

The worst service ever. And I'm not a rude person, at all. I said "please" and "thank you." And I absolutely was not greeted whatsoever. Whoever that dumbass lady was, that was working needs to take that stick out of her. Don't be mad at me 'cause you hate YOUR job, bitch. Let's not forget that everyone is REPLACEABLE, including your miserable self. It took every bit of me not to cuss her out. I'd write a letter to corporate but she did not give me a receipt. Go figure right. I'm not one to talk down on people that works fast food because it's not in my character to knock someone's hustle. But she really needs to get it together. And for that, I will NOT ever return to this McDonald's ever again. Some bullshit. Oh. And. Not only did I not get a receipt... I didn't get a straw. And instead of 10 piece chicken nuggets, I got 9. What in the fucking fuck..... Fuck that McDonalds.

Everybody knows whats what when it comes to McDonalds, i would've thought it worthless to write a review for a fast food chain but i particularly had to do this one for a reason. This McDonalds in particular had a customer appreciation thing going on that was great, i can positively say that i hadn't seen it in any other McDonalds. They had daily specials and some of them were pretty good, like 2 Big Macs for five dollars. Unfortunately they aren't having these anymore but i thought it was ver worthy of mentioning. Also, the drive thru for this location is kinda wierd.

I come here unfortunately about 2 times a week. My son has autism and has to have McDonald fries and apple juice. The staff is usually over the top nice or the complete opposite, I prefer the staff that have all their teeth .. really gotta wean my child off fries haha because I seriously hate Mcdonalds

SUPER slow drive-thru (even at 10PM!) but the guy at the window made up for it by hooking me up with a couple free frozen lemonade coupons!! No purchase necessary? I'm there!

REVIEW #3:  2 stars  (882 chars)
I'm not a McDonald's eater. Blame Fast Food Nation, blame their rash of bad publicity, or blame common sense, but the "food" here isn't really good and we all know it. That being said, their double cheese burger tastes like childhood and you can't deny that, either. ...  ... I usually stop here to hit up the Redbox machine, but occasionally I'll pop in to grab a treat for my BF or a friend. Somehow, in the handful of times I've gone in, they've always been out of chocolate shakes. And half the time their coffee is lukewarm despite being fresh-made.  ...  ... Without fail, this place is always kind of messy, and their parking lot layout is a disaster waiting to happen- it's small and seems like half the spots are handicap-only, but luckily the lot itself connects on either side to the car wash and the Walmart plaza. Because you can't go to one without going to the other.

McDonalds food served by English language challenged people. Enough said.

REVIEW #5:  2 stars  (479 chars)
This has got to be one of the slowest drive-thrus I have ever had the pleasure of waiting in line for! I only ordered medium sized french fries and a hot chocolate, and it took at least 20 minutes to finally get my order!  And to top that off, when it was finally my turn at the window, it took them 5 minutes to open the window to tell me that my order will be ready shortly! You may think I am exaggerating, but I am not! Hopefully my next time there will not be as horrendous!

I am not a normal patron of McDonald's. I make it a goal in life never to step foot in these nasty soulless establishments, but AMEX was offering 5$ off of 5$, so I went into this place (looks as good as a McD can look from the outside) and as soon as I step foot I notice there are napkins all over the floor like if it was a part of the new tiling scheme or something.  ...  ... I grasp my Chipotle bag a bit closer. Get in queue. ...  ... There is this guy in one of the front-row stools facing the action at the registers that is praying over his poor, chemical/GMO laboratory-concocted excuse for 'food'. I thought I entered one of those live art installations I learned about in Art Appreciation and on World's Dumbest (which my girlfriend watches, not me!). Try to ignore him.  ...  ... Finally, after what seems like fifteen minutes (how is it that Chipotle next door not only took my order immediately, but had my food bagged and charged in less amount of time and it is REAL FUCKING FOOD?), I reach a really short Latina lady that seems like she has zero happiness left in her life and she wishes she was in whichever state in whatever country she is originally from instead of here.  ...  ... "Good afternoon." ... ::weird look:: from the cashier ... "Five dollar gift card, please." ... "Fif dolla." ... "Yes, ma'am." ... I try to hand her my CC in an awkward misunderstanding on procedure at McDonald's in 2012.  ... She points at the self-serve CC machine aggressively angry.    ... Seconds later, I am about to slide my card and she updates me on breaking development: no cards for gift card; cash only. ... "Uh, really. Cancel that then."  ... I walk out in defeat.  ...  ... I have asked around regarding this seemingly concocted policy rule and was told to go to a nicer McDonald's. Well, it's really relative, because there is no such thing as a 'nice' McDonald's, simply varying levels of shittiness accompanying your shit faux-food. - E

I wish i had the chance to choose which cashier to help me. I always end up with that rude disrespectful Af-Am lady. Too bad i only had few minutes for my break, and it's close to school. I swear i've tried all the fast food chains around CSN. ...  ... Okay, let's get straight to the point. I always get the worst customer service EVERYTIME she's the cashier. She shouldn't be there. No smiles, no greet, she just takes orders, tell you how much is the damage and would give you a weird look if you give her exact change. ...  ... Recently, i went there again to grab a quick lunch. Same thing did happen! Lol i ordered Mcbites and she forgot to put the sauce in my bag. As i was going through inside my bag, not even knowing something was missing, take note i was holding my bag in my arms, she shoots the sauce inside my bag like a basketball pro and then stares at me like "there's your sauce bitch, you can leave now." Lol it was sorta funny but come on! Say atleast excuse me? ...  ... Never heard any word from her besides, "medium or large?" ...  ... She needs to go back to training or stay in kitchen.

Something is fishy about this McDonalds. That is all the fishes swimming in the awesome aquarium in the heart of the dining area. This is no ordinary aquarium. It is an aquatic garden. McDonalds made what would've been an ordinary McDonalds attached to a Chevron into a fun restaurant to dine in. Children seemed amazed by the fish. There are seats arranged around the aquarium, that offer closeup views. For guests who are drinking a beverage, there are more comfortable lounge seats that overlook the aquarium. ...    I was happy with the service, food, and overall experience. ...   BTW, I uploaded two pictures of the aquarium this businesses Yelp page.

What a crappy slow drive thru in the mornings! Because there's 2 order screens, your order can easily get mixed up if stupid drivers cut in front of you.  Bad call McDonald's.   ...  ... Food was slapped on.  But hey, that's why it's fast food.

Yeah, I eat at McDonald's. What of it? I am hooked on breakfast sandwiches, okay?  Leave me alone. I don't care if it's a $20 breakfast sandwich from room service or a $3 sandwich from McDonald's. Addicted. ...  ... This particular McDonald's is in a gas station, which is pretty dope. And this is a good stop if you're headed to Lee Canyon for skiing. ...  ... Fish tank!  There is one at this McDonald's. Say again, fish tank!

Been to this location repeatedly.  Almost always a good experience.  Nothing to write home about, but the drive thru is fast and my order is almost always right.

I stop by this MCD's drive thru often when I'm on my way to/from the Clark County Shooting Park. This one is fast and my order has never been messed up. I pull up, order, pay and am off with my food. Never have to wait around much, which is exactly the point of going to a fast food joint.

The woman over the drive-through mic was pleasant and had a good sense of humor. She informed me of the coffee special and $1 coffee makes me very happy. ...  ... That was it. I wanted fast, in & out coffee and got great service and a good product at a good price.  ...  ... I don't really eat fast food, but if I was going to, I would go back to this McDonalds.

I use to work at the Costco in front of this McDonalds so it was pretty much my sole food option for lunch at work. I am worn out on this food for a decade or two, but the service was always pretty good, and the drive thru was always really fast, so ther's not much to complain about here.

On my way home after ending my work day late on the eve of my Christmas vacation I decided to celebrate (and fill my empty stomach) with a quick snack.  I wasn't to excited to go to a McDonalds in between a Costco and WalMart especially on Christmas week, but I was pleasantly surprised the place was not over crowded.  I went through the drive through because I was anxious to get home and relax.  Although there was 3 cars in front of me I made it through quickly.  Had something to do with both Drive-thru windows open and the dude taking the order was competent and friendly. ...  ... I ordered a Mint Mocha with my fries (strange combination I know) and it was delightful.  Could have been a little bit hotter, but other than that it was enjoyable. ...  ... Overall I have a pleasant experience at this MD's.  A rare occurrence these days.

Was Starvin' like Marvin yesterday morning and went to the drive thru to grab something on the way to an early morning meeting.  While I don't eat at McDonald's too often, this one in particular was impressive....why?  Well, for starters they open both drive thru windows, which makes it go 2x faster.....many fast food places no longer open the second window and it takes forever to get through. ...  ... I ordered 2 Sausage McMuffin Sandwiches and a Bottle of Water.  The service was quick, the food was hot and fresh.  What more could I ask for? ...  ... Will I return?  Next time I'm in a pinch for breakfast, you bet!

I recognize that after midnight might appear to be late, but c'mon, guys, this is Las Vegas!  After having dinner on the Las Vegas Strip and catching Jubilee at the Flamingo, my wife and I decided to cap off date night with an ice cream cone and hot apple pie from McDonalds on the way home. ...  ... No dice.  Despite the long line at the drive thru, we were informed that the ice cream machine was down.  No problem, we thought, just give us our hot apple pies and we'll take a latte to share. ...  ... Now, the fact that the package the apple came in read "Caution: HOT!" led me to believe that the apple pie would actually be, you know, hot.  My handy dandy insta-read thermometer informs me that the actual temperature of my "HOT!" apple pie is actually 70 degrees Fahrenheit.  If I convert this temperature to Kelvin, THEN  it seems to be hot, but on both the Fahrenheit and Celsius scales this seems to be sorely lacking. ...  ... C'mon guys.  It doesn't seem to much to ask that the "HOT!" apples pies at least be warmer than body temperature.  Given the fact that the line for the drive-thru was at least 10 cars long when we arrived, I assume that there was enough turn-over in your food inventory to ensure that the products you were selling were fresh and hot.  I am disappointed with this experience!

I stopped by this McDonalds yesterday to pick up breakfast for my wife and son. To find when I get home that they had not given me half my order. Being in a time crunch I decided to call, The manager acknowledge that they knew they had left things out on accident and so i tried to tell them to refund my card but I was told they could not do that and that if I wanted to I could come in the next morning and they would give me what they had forgot to give me. I was not happy about having to go back but I did. Now I'm even more unhappy after going there this morning and trying to get what they forgot to give me. The manager was rude and acted like I was wasting her time to get my food that they had forgot to give me. So after giving me some cold mcmuffins, no apology  and could not even offer me a free cup of coffee for my major inconvenience. I left and will never go back to this McDonald's. I know people make mistakes but it's how you correct those mistakes and the customer service you give when you make a mistake that matters. Corporate needs to help this McDonald's get it together!

REVIEW #10:  1 stars  (2187 chars)
I understand that this is a McDonald's, so what did I expect? I used to work in this shopping center so I ended up at it a shameful amount. They have always, always been a hot mess.  ...  ... Still, I always seem to forget and give it another chance, but I had the worst fast food experience of my life here a few weeks ago.  ...  ... It was about 11:30 p.m. when I pulled into the drive-thru, with 4 cars ahead of me. I place my order and pull up a little bit. That was the last time I moved for the next 20 minutes. It is not an exaggeration. The drive-thru is set up so that there is absolutely no way you can get out of it once you're in it. I was trapped in this stupid drive-thru for what felt like an eternity, and I hadn't even paid. ...  ... When I finally get to the first window, there is nobody there. After about a minute the girl came scurrying in and had to ask me what I had ordered. Holy. Crap. (As a side note, cashier girl, if you ever read this, I'm sorry I was kind of rude to you. I felt pretty bad about it. It wasn't your fault.) ...  ... Anyway, after finally paying, we're stuck again. While I'm waiting, I can see the food window handing bags and taking them back from the car that's there currently. Great, they're messing up orders. The next car has the same situation. ...  ... I get up to the window and the guy hands me a bag that is very clearly not my food based on the size, but I checked anyway. Nope. I wait for him to come back and tell him, and he grabs the other bag that had been sitting there since before I even got to the window and hands me that one instead. No apology, nothing. He didn't even look inside either of the bags. ...  ... The worst part of all of it is that after this 30-minute journey, my fries were so cold. So, so cold. Hot McDonald's fries are the only reason to go to McDonald's! At that point, I just wanted to get as far away as possible from this place.  ...  ... It should never be so hard to get terrible food. I always go to McDonald's with hardly any expectation, but somehow this one always seems to surprise me. Wait through the light at 215 and go to Burger King instead if you've got a hankering for $1 burgers.

After being opened only a couple of days, this is the newest McDonald's to open in the Las Vegas valley. In a few days there will be another McDonald's opening a few miles west at Blue Diamond and Durango. ...  ...   I just happened to have caught this McDonald's act on the way back from hiking. The Blue Diamond Road landscape seems to change every week. New to the landscape is the old familiar Golden Arches sign. After hiking for six hours I was exhausted and needed a snack. ...  ...   Lately my opinion of McDonald's is that it does a better job of filling the void for a light meal, snack, Frape Mocha, or coffee if a coffee shop is not around. To temporarily hold over my appetite and enjoy a beverage besides water that I had been drinking all the day on the hike, I ordered the $1 large Coke and $1 hot & spicy. ...  ...   Being a new McDonalds this location is modern and for now immacuately clean. First off it is a nice first impression when a McDonald's is not part of a gas station, like the one down the road at Blue Diamond and Rainbow. I entered through modern electric sliding doors. There were two managers, and I got a nice greeting. The workers were on top of their game. There were plenty of booths to choose from. The interior is more contemporary than McDonald Land. The McDonald Playland is nonexistent. What does exist is a chandelier and a more elegant lobby. They did not go modern to the point of some restaurants that feature the super Coke machines with a 100 plus flavors. The typical Coke flavors they had were not flat. ...  ...  McDonald's may not be 4 star dining. However, when I just want a snack to fill me up or a Frape Caramel; McDonald's gets the job done.  ...  ... The Daniel. S Yelp 100 Challenge. Review 88.

The Drive Thru sucks. I mean the food comes out quickly. And Whether ordering inside or in your car you get it fast. A plus being you can hit the convenience store and get gas or snacks. But literally the drive thru dumps you at the entrance and exit on Rainbow blvd and its hard to get out. And if you come in the wrong way, you have to flip a u turn to get into the drive thru. To late for them to redo it now. I guess when im on that side of town, ill venture inside from now on.

This is a prime location for residents of Mountains Edge sitting on such a busy corner.  The fries here are always tasteless and soggy, they are slow to move the drive through along and parking is difficult based on the building configuration.  If I feel like grabbing a #2 value meal I much rather travel to the McDonalds 4 miles North on Rainbow.

A shiny, bronzed group of Chicken McNuggets with formed pretend-tatoes in a 4-color box served by a high-school student or college intern and a toy to boot?? From the drive-thru even? Where can I  pay money?? I  want to pay real money for this! And afterward, I  want to gas up my car, yup! Then I  want to play bad vintage top 40 music blasting on my factory car radio system "I  wanna be a cowboy. And you can be my cowgirl." ...  ... I  showed up at 430am looking for a quarter pounder and they were only serving breakfast, even though the sign says differently. Another time I  showed up at 1030am and tried to order breakfast and they stopped serving breakfast. ...  ... I  really think this Mickey D's is cray cray adorbs. 4 r e al z.

I have to tell you it's been 2 years since I've been at a McDonalds and all I got was a Coffee Frap, it was gross, felt greasy in my mouth...like their food. Which I haven't eaten in probably 4 years and regretted it then. It's so gross! ... Haven't had a Shamrock Shake in years...it's that time of year and wanted to give it a shot. Used the drive thru, there was hardly a wait. Staff was pleasant but the stench of moth balls was unbearable when they opened the drive up window. Yuk! Thankfully the shake didn't taste like the smell of the store. Not really minty, it was okay, nothing special. I'm over the Shamrock shake.  ... Lets see how long it'll be this time till I make it to another McDonalds.

Its a McDonald's attached to a gas station so you cant expect much. Food was ok as you cant screw that up to bad at a franchise restaurant.  ...  ... You do have to put up with the horrible parking lot/ gas station traffic if you park and go in the dinning room is loud/small with tons of little kids running around (no playground for the kids and the parents seem to let them run wild) ...  ... Napkins are by the register not by the the straws or the soda machine so make sure you grab a few when you pay for your meal or you will have to push your way to the front to get them afterwards.  ...  ... There are other McDonalds near by and you are better off visiting one of them.

OK. so.  When we first moved here..... We had a bunch of friends visit and come stay at our brand new house back in 2008?  I don't remember... a while back.  But this joint was still fairly new.  We came here on the way to the airport to drop off our weekend guests at the McCarran for a quick bite to eat.   ...  ... [Keep in mind that this is during the summertime] ...  ... So we go in.. and there are flies.  FLIES.  all over the place.  I'm weirded out and the employees are acting like nothings wrong.  I'm not sure what to do at this point and I've suddenly lost my appetite.  So I approach the counter and I ask... what's going on?  And the young man at the counter was at a loss and kinda giving me the "get out of here" look.  So, I made a judgement call and decided that we needed to get out of there.   ...  ... I'm not talking about 1 or 2 flies that the auto door can bring in.  It was like walking through a wall.  ...  ... O_O   ...  ...  ... Next.... I should say that I have been back.  BUT. . .  years later and not after I put in a call to let the proper people know that there was a HUGE problem. ...  ... ... it's not always the cleanest either.  ...  ... I haven't encountered that problem since.... but, still not the first one I'd go to though it IS RIGHT there.

This isn't even a legitimate McDonald's... It's a gas station McDonald's! ...  ... I've been to this location twice. Once to meet up a stranger off Craigslist and once to try and redeem my Big Mac LivingSocial coupon. The place is clean, but the location attracts some of the local bums in the area. The smell of urine is simply unappealing. I also tried to redeem my LivingSocial coupon. They wouldn't accept it, because they couldn't find a button on the menu for it. Lame.  ...  ...  A little about my credentials: ... I first got into cooking & food when I was in college. After being rejected by numerous girls and getting zero action, I decided it was time for a change. I needed a new makeover to boost my geeky image. I applied for a cooking position at a Mediterranean-Italian Restaurant near my home and learned to cook all sorts of dishes. I never became a professional chef, but I continue to enjoy & love food. 9 years later and 55 lbs heavier, I have a new passion for traveling and trying different foods around the world.

This location is part of a gas station and has not been updated in years. The food is alright but there are always flies flying around in the dinning room which is pretty unappetizing to say the least. You would think someone there would have noticed by now as I have seen the flies on several occasions.

This McDonald's is connected to the Terrible's convenience store/gas station and not particularly one of my favorites. ...  ... It's convenient when you're driving down Blue Diamond from the west, but I think the staff could use some training in the customer service end from the other McDonald's nearby. ...  ... The last time we ate there, we watched (and listened) as one of the staff members hollered from the dining area to the kitchen.  Apparently she was on break (and eating) and still wanted to maintain her conversation with her colleagues, so she continued it by screaming across the dining room and they, in turn, hollered back.  Very professional group here. ...  ... I'm sure all the other customers enjoyed the show as well.

This review is only for the one in Rainbow and Blue Diamond of SouthWest Vegas.  I go here because it's one of the few Mcdees thats open 24hrs.  Menu and taste is the same as the other Mcdees around town.  Would have gotten one more star if they served breakfast before 5am because I went at 4:40am and they were just doing the lunch menu still. They denied me of a good warm hearty breakfast and had to settle for an unhealthy BIG MAC combo with a coke.

A first for the gf and I - a visit to McDonald's !  Surprisingly, out of the blue, the gf was recovering from the flu and said she was craving McDonald's french fries.  Before i could get out the door to make a Mickie-D run the gf yells out asking for a filet of fish, " anything else ? " , she calls out for a chocolate shake, too.  Yep, I guess she's feeling better ! ...  ... So i order: ...  ... Large Fries - $2.09 ... Chocolate Shake - $2.79 ... Filet of Fish - $3.79 ... 20 piece chicken nuggets - $4.99 ... Diet coke - $1.00 ...  ... My first thought - dang, Mickie d's ain't all that cheap, $3.79 for a filet of fish ?!  Seems high to me. ...  ... The taste ?  Holy cow - some of the worst food we've had in a very long time !  My guess is the nuggets were sitting out for several hours - we ate 4 of them and stopped.  The fries were limpy, wimpy, limpy.  The filet of fish was ok at best.  Shake was ok.   ...  ... This is a reminder why the only reason i hit McDonald's is for a soda - best value and basically a safe bet !

ahhhhh just got home after getting drive thru at this location. i really considered turning around and going back but gave up on the thought. I ordered a spicy chicken sandwich with no mayo and a medium fry with a side of BBQ sauce.  ...  ... heres what i got ...  ... a spicy chicken sandwich with tons of mayo and a broken bun because of all the disgusting white shit everywhere.  ... a medium fry that was literally half full, honestly me saying it was half full was exaggerating, it was about a third full.  ... and guess what no BBQ sauce BUT an open ketchup packet that got everywhere.  ...  ... BRAVO... BRAVO. and this is why i rarely eat fast food.

The moment I pull up and walk inside I'm thinking...Is this really Mcdonald's?!  It sure doesn't look like the typical Mcdonald's.

The only McD's I will eat at. Not only is the decor bright and fun and totally unlike any other McD's I've ever seen, but the food is always 100% picture perfect. Everything is always hot, fresh and literally looks like the food they show in the commercials. My burger never appears stepped on or flattened or half wrapped like the other fast food places. I see many other people have already commented on the unique interior and it is very charming and way cooler than any fast food place. I give this location an A+ in every catergory!

Thinking too myself why the hell would I ever write review about golden arches because seen one seen them all. SO NOT true about this location. The food need not say anything because its  McDonald classic been around forever still have the best french fries.  ...  ... The main reason for this review is all about the atmosphere and for SURE the interior design. We all think fast food go plastic chairs, maybe run down, no tv, and nothing special or gets ones attention. Not the case with this one! The exterior design who the hell sees water fountain in front of McD. Once get inside they have all these separate areas almost stand out by themselves. Walk in left have wide screen tv area chill out, the one area they have chandelier hanging and nice big widescreen watch with lounge chairs/basically going too starbucks or coffee shop area, even the kids play area nothing like normal ones with the plastic balls or the kids climbing around (it couple turtles kids play around and even mini play house) and walk around lot cleaner kids area then normal ones, and even the soda fountain area two separate ones lots of choices all really clean, and just everything about the place is different. I been too many McD in my lifetime so far and swear never in life imagine McD this nice or really feels more like restaurant then fast food joint. If ever want enjoy the finer McD in life check this one out. Lol!!!

This is THE McDonald's that everyone wishes were in their neighborhood.  Probably the newest one in Las Vegas, it definitely sets the bar of what you hope all McDonald's could be like! ...  ... Located on S. Rainbow with its major cross streets being Warm Springs and the 215, it has generated quite a buzz! ...  ... With a flowing fountain to welcome you, the inside feels more like a coffee lounge.  Cool color tones welcomes you to take advantage of their free WiFi and the large TV has you hanging out longer than you normally would.   ...  ... Instead of the typical outdoor play area for kids with those plastic balls (an area rarely ever cleaned), this location has an indoor area that looks like it could be cleaned and inspected on a regular basis.  There's also a few larger tables set aside for what could be private parties - birthday parties at Mickey D's are coming back perhaps? ...  ... Nonetheless, this fast food joint and design are a welcome addition to the neighborhood, even if there's another McDonald's less than a mile away in the Arroyo Crossing shopping center.

This location has been renovated with current colors and decor.  Inside you will be surprised to find purple, black and grey as the theme, a small play area for kids and equally kind-to-parents sitting area where those kids can be watched over and still have a conversation.  I can see they are going for a cafe experience and they might have nailed it.   ...  ... Most impressive is the staff at this particular location.  They are clean, polite and look like they are going somewhere in life, not like they could not make it.   ...  ... The food is still poison, and we still crave and submit to it because they have been pumping it into our brains and bodies for decades.  They created an addiction by processing and mutilating food.  But at least you can enjoy it in a new atmosphere.  I'm no stronger than the next person, but I limit my intake.   ...  ... Chow Chow~

We are truly blessed to have one of the nicest mcdonalds in town, and only a few minutes away from my home. I don't eat here much anymore, but this mcdonalds is always first on my list whenever I need some food.  ...  ... Thank the foodie gods for this beautiful and CLEAN McDonalds.

Didn't think I'd be reviewing a McDonald's like most people have been saying on here, but I'm finally annoyed enough to write. First off, I walk in and there's a guy texting on his phone behind the front counter and behind the shift lead. If this Corporate location is attempting to make McDonald's look more upscale and professional, then the employees should be the part as well. Texting in front of customers is unacceptable, whether on break or not. If you're on break, you should be using your cell phone in a non-public area, out of view of guests. Second, the shift lead that took my order rang up the wrong special order on my Crispy Chicken Classic because she was distracted by engaging in conversation with co-workers... which should stop completely when a guest is present. I think this location lacks accountability of its employees, and soon, it will become a free-for-all if a stop isn't put to it.

I stopped by here to grab a quick lunch on my way back to work and when I got to my work I noticed something under my drink lid. Open it and to my surprise it was a dead bug stuck to the lid! GROSS  ...  ... I tried calling to let them know but it just rings and rings and no one answers! Will not be coming back!

REVIEW #16:  1 stars  (1140 chars)
Never thought in a million years I be writing a review on McDonald's but I thought this visit warranted one.  I have to preface this with the only reason I actually went inside to eat was I was with a friend who has a toddler and the only thing that was going to make him happy was the play land area. Ok here goes, when we first walked in I noticed all the fake plants everywhere, and the fountain, and the bench. Am I at McDonald's or an old ladies house? By far the strangest mcds I've ever been to. Then it gets more interesting, the inside is a poor attempt at making this a hip lounge. With damask wallpaper and a small sitting type lounge area with a cheap chandelier, I couldn't help but laugh. Oh and did I mention the guy passed out sleeping in this "lounge" area? Random men were walking in and out of the restrooms, I truly felt like I was in the twilight zone.  ...  ... Now onto the service, we had a fairly simple order, and not only did they get it wrong not once, but 3 times, and gave us an attitude with it. This isn't rocket science people. Learn to speak English. ...  ... I know why I never go to fast food places now.

If I told you that McDonald's was a big factor in my weight loss of 20 lbs last year, you probably wouldn't believe me. Not unless you are one of my coworkers that see me at work every morning eating my Sausage McMuffin and have witnessed my slimmer physique.  ...  ... Well, it's true. Breakfast really is the most important meal of the day and I found that skipping breakfast is not a good idea if you're trying to lose weight/get fit. Even though its not the most wholesome breakfast option, this is the quickest, cheapest way for me to get my morning meal. ...  ... I am not writing anything about McDonald's that you might already know. I'm writing about this particular location. They are always super fast and efficient at the drive thru and every employee I've encountered over the past few years here are very friendly. I come here so often that I should just write a review and give kudos to the Mon-Fri morning crew for always getting my order out fast, quick and in a hurry before heading to work. Even when the drive thru lane is packed, they move it pretty quickly so I've never found myself sitting in my car for more than a few minutes. ...  ... So just in case you're wondering what I order every morning here it is: a sausage Egg White Delight and a medium sugar-free vanilla iced coffee. I automatically throw away one piece of the muffin to save on carbs. I know it sounds crazy but it works. For me, a carb conscious way of life works best. And this keeps me satiated enough until I have to nuke my Lean Cuisine around noon time.

Like I have said before, having children makes it nearly a necessary thing to be at McDonalds about once a week. This isn't always for Happy Meals (we prefer home cooked food to fast food always - especially for our kids), but I don't mind treating him with a soft serve cone or a Sprite on the way home from the park, or maybe when he's been really good at the grocery store. They also tend to be a good caffeine fix for me when I don't feel like the Bux.  ...  ... This McDonalds is on the way to "Grandma's House" so we make stops here more frequently than any other on this side of the valley. We've never encountered any problems more than the occassional broken straw here. Employees are generally pleasant. How much better could a Mickey D's get?

REVIEW #3:  4 stars  (229 chars)
My son loves to go to the play place, usually the kids are nice, the parents are nice too. Employees are polite for the most part, bathrooms are clean. Sadly this area has more crime each time I come here so I just stopped going.

This McDonalds is so close to my place that it's become a task to try not to stop by here on my way home.  So far I have not encountered any problems with either the staff or the food here and the service is still quick.  That's about all I can ask for in a McDonalds.  Keep up the good work.

REVIEW #5:  3 stars  (1041 chars)
This is a nice McDonald's.  The place is always clean, the staff is friendly, and it usually isn't too crowded, except for the drive thru, which always has a long line any time of day it seems.  The inside seating area is always clean and well stocked. ...  ... I come here with my daughter so she can play in their play area.  She is 18 months and loves all of the climbing this McDs has.  This play area is always nice and clean as well.  In fact when we are there, someone is always cleaning it or just finishing up cleaning the area.  They even go through the tunnels and all.  It is a nice place, especially on those blistering summer days when it is too hot to go to the park. ...  ... My only complaint would be that they hide the sweet tea behind the counter.  I am a sweet tea addicted and it is a little annoying to have to go up to the counter to get a refill, especially when you have to wait in line with everyone ordering.  I need my sweet tea fix and waiting just doesn't count it.   ...  ... Overall, it is a nice McDonald's.

REVIEW #6:  3 stars  (3207 chars)
Yes, I often indulge myself with the fine cuisine that is found at my local McDonald's.  OK, OK really I try not to go there that often unless it's the only thing to eat or I'm hankerin' for a damn McNugget (which by the way I still HAVE NOT found which part on the chicken the nugget is on).  Addictive with Hot Mustard. ...  ... I went here exclusively this day because of the current coupons that came in the mail.  There were a bunch of decent ones, particularly the ones that are promoting you try the new McCrap...oi...I mean McWrap.  This is almost as catchy as that 'Fishay, Fishay' song from the previous McDonald's food campaign for Fish McBites over the Easter season.  I swear if I see a wall of fish singing this tune to me at any location I will make like Grizzly Adams and run for the hills.   ...  ... I took my McWrap coupon and waltz into my closest McDonald's.  The visit's coupon was for a free McWrap of my choice with the purchase of any menu item (including the $1 Value Menu).  I got me a $1 Sweet Tea (1/2 & 1/2 to avoid extra sugar) to go with my McWrap.  I chose the Chicken & Bacon McWrap, grilled.  Oi, why McDonald's thought this thing could compete with a $5 footlong from Subway I don't know. ...  ... My Chicken & Bacon McWrap was really MEH.  The chicken was ok but was on the cold side, and my bacon?  Damn stuff is the same thing they put on your typical McDonald's breakfast fare.  Skinny and not much flavor.  The chicken was warm enough that it completely wilted the Spring Mix type lettuce in my McWrap.  Either that...or the Spring Mix was not cold to begin with!  I hate that.  Overly soggy lettuce.  Bleech.  The tomatoes that came in my McWrap were warm as well.  Not to mention, I have a feeling my McWrap was made prior to my ordering because the tortilla it came in was showing signs of sogginess too.  Not made fresh me thinks!  These guys and their speed over quality sometimes. ...  ... Taste?  I rather have a wrap somewhere else and pay a bit more.  The flavors just weren't that great to justify a regular price of $4 per McWrap.  If I didn't have this coupon I wouldn't have bothered trying it.  The best part about the McWrap was the damn box it came in!  It was cool & hip, and I felt like I was unwrapping a present when I tore through that seal.  But other than that, nothing.  I would have much rather used the coupon for a free Happy Meal with purchase.  I love those things!  But only when they come in the actual Happy Meal box with the Golden Arches handles, not in a friggin' paper bag.  Grrrrr....I hate it when my Happy Meal comes in a regular bag.  Makes me NOT happy. ...  ... Anyway, this trip to McDonald's was a bit of a bust.  Was hoping to give them a chance with this new fandangled McCrap...darn it there I go again...McWrap, but it just didn't impress me.  If they were made upon ordering and with much fresher ingredients, and not sitting by a heat lamp then maybe it would have been a better experience.  Maybe I should hit up another McDonald's and give this thing another shot.  Well, at least I had a coupon for buy one Dipped Cone, get one free!  I double fisted that sucker all the way home!  Ok, I actually shared for once.

Mcdonalds is mcdonalds as far as good goes. What separates them from each other is service. This mcdonalds has nooooo idea what that means. The emergency door was beeping like a smoke detector with a bad battery. Other people were complaining about the same beep, and some got up and left the playroom. Notified the manager of the issue and she acted uninterested and gave me a look of disgust because I bothered her during social hour. I wish I was kidding or exaggerating about her face. The look almost turned me to stone. Bad manager!!

C'mon now, who hasn't grown up with Mickey D's? Yeah, we all loved them growing up, but slowly got more health conscious as we grew older....Still can't deny the addicting fries though, gotta have 'em once in the blue moon, and the Mc Rib has a cult following that can't wait until they serve it up again! ...  ... Me? I like their food toys.  The Minions are the coolest things lately, and they just crack me up! I just had to add them to my other cool collectibles, the "transforming" Mickey D's food toys...remember those? ...  ... I just wish they brought back the OG Apple Pie...I miss that deep fried goodness!!! ...  ... ALOHA!!!

2 stars bcuz I like McDonald's no matter what but dang-- fast food does not equal bad customer service. We ordered big so naturally, you would think a big bag would be in order but no. carrying the bag into the house, it ripped. I ordered the #11 (Fish Filet) and it never fails that the fish is never centered on the bun. We asked for sweet & sour sauce n grabbing it out of the bag, my girlfriend found it to be open already! ick! :( bad experiences = less customers. Make sure everything is in order before you leave.

REVIEW #5:  1 stars  (822 chars)
Normally I would not go to a fast food restaurant and I have different tastes however I decided to try McDonald's on Ann Road. The gentleman who took my order was very polite and got the order 100% correct. When I got to my worksite I had determined that the chicken nuggets that I ordered were cold. My work site with less than a quarter of a mile from this McDonald's and there is no reason for the nuggets to be that cold that quick. I did try several of them and all of them tasted as it had been sitting out for a while and were not fresh. I ended up throwing out all of the food that I lost my appetite due to the taste of the nugget. I am relatively sure that this is because it's the graveyard shift and is only two employees inside that McDonald's. I will not be going back to that Restaurants in the near future.

REVIEW #6:  1 stars  (958 chars)
This McDonalds is right next to my house, while I like the convenience, I have had numerous bad experiences with wait time during the late night drive thru only hours. This last time the guy in front of me waited  10+ minutes for whatever her ordered, then when I pulled up I had to wait 10+ minutes for my 2 Egg McMuffins. I knocked on the window and asked for a refund as I was tired of waiting, the girl who was doodling got rude with me and told me its late night and they just started there late night breakfast at 12am...It was 2am. Another girl heard the convo and brought over my "warm" egg McMuffins and I left. ...   ... This is actually the only place I have EVER written a corporation about for bad service.  I won't ever be going back there. Rather drive down to Jack n the Box on Craig. ...  ... To McDonalds credit, they called me and apologized and said they would look into it. So I shall just find other McDonalds to go to when in the mood.

Don't be fooled.  The address isn't to the McDonald's in the photo.  This McDonalds is actually located in the Wal*Mart across the street. ...  ... They used to have workers there that were really unprofessional, but they shaped up their workers recently, I think.  The food is pretty good, can't complain.  Being in a Wal*Mart, they bring out the food pretty fast because it gets pretty busy at certain hours.  I do like this McDonald's and it's good because they're pretty much 24-hours.  Except for that one hour they close at 1am.  ^_^

REVIEW #2:  4 stars  (787 chars)
This location exclusively has 8pm-4am midnight snack of 6 piece nugget + small fries for $1.99!  ...  ... This location is inside the Walmart at Arroyo Crossing. It is probably very convenient and I always fall for the fact that it is in Walmart when I shop here. The staff are very nice and quick about taking the customer's orders and food are always pretty quick. There usually is a line of 1-2 when I visit but that could probably just be the time I get there. ...  ... I never had any 'problems' with the food that they 'served' me. ... I think the unique thing was the midnight snack advertisement they have. If you are here between 8PM - 4AM, they have a special of 6 piece chicken nugget + a small fry for 1.99 which is something I never seen advertised at other McDonald places.

REVIEW #3:  4 stars  (926 chars)
This McDonald's is located inside the Walmart at the Arroyo Crossing shopping center.  Since it's our local Walmart, we pass by this Mickey D's all the time.  More often than not, the Husband convinces me that he's hungry and wants to grab a snack while we're there.  Usually it's something easy like their Hot N Spicy Chicken Sandwich, but other times we've sat down for a full meal. ...  ... My most recent find discovery was during Halloween.  They were selling these Halloween Treat books for $1 each!  Inside were coupons for free apple dippers, free small cones, and free apple juice or milk jugs.  You get a total of 12 coupons for $1!  What a deal!  And what makes this location cooler than others is that they even offered it!  (I tried purchasing more at another location and they didn't offer it!) ...  ... Overall, they are pretty efficient and professional than some of the other McDonald's I've been to in Vegas.

REVIEW #4:  4 stars  (380 chars)
Very cool inside, Vegas' newest McDonald's with free WiFi like most other locations. What McDonald's has a chandelier? Cool blue, purple and black color palate used. The seating area inside of the restaurant has a newer designer. The giant Las Vegas Sign in the main sitting area with the rather larger TV is a nice touch. This location has a 24 hour drive-thru as of this review.

REVIEW #5:  3 stars  (286 chars)
Inside of Walmart so no drive thru. Gets crowded easily, especially with carts in the way. Sticky counters. You don't wanna bump into the trashcans cause they're covered in ketchup. Never have to wait long though and employees are usually pretty nice. Same stuff you'd get at any McD's.

It was a McDonald's ... no just a McDonald's, but a McDonald's in a Walmart - it don't get better than this!   We had very good service. Food made "fresh" - but the people after us were ignored at the counter.  As for McDonald's, I think this one is not bad - just do not go and expect to feel good later.

This place is connected to a Chevron gas station and is open 24/7. The inside is sometime messy but, the staff that works the drive thru is usually always nice and gets your order correct the first time. I also like the fact that the drinks come in plastic cups and not the Styrofoam ones that some are using. The plastic one make the ice last longer and so the drink stays colder. This is an American staple and will always be back.

REVIEW #4:  3 stars  (487 chars)
I don't use the drive thru much but I was in a hurry to drop off my rental car and parking was non existent.  ...  ... My order a Angus burger combo and a apple pie. The burger was good, only exception there was excess mayo.. The fries were cooked perfectly - crisp and yummy. I've always been a fan of the apple pies at two for .99 or the same for one. Ended up getting only one. ...  ... Can't go wrong with McDonald's if you're in a hurry for fast food and they offer healthy options.

REVIEW #5:  3 stars  (406 chars)
The sliding door to the Vegas Summer heat was open & broken during my entire visit. The fries were sub par, but I powered through them because I was so hungry. I should have asked for new fries which has been a good idea in the past. ...  ... Did you know you can order fries sans salt? The chicken wrap was ok, but I've had better from other McD's before. ...  ... The staff was nice when taking my order.

Typical. ...  ... Late night.....drive-thru kinda sucks!  You order at the first window (not through the speaker) but the window...so by the time you get to the second window ( if there aren't any cars in front of you) then you're just waiting for them to make your food. ... So you can be sitting there from 10 minutes (minimum) to about 20 minutes. ... Not really fast-food if you ask me but sometimes MCD's just fills the craving...especially after drunk and partying on the strip all night long and its time to just head back and unwind.!

REVIEW #7:  2 stars  (1994 chars)
Stopped in for a quick bite to eat, as I was running very late to meet friends. I normally avoid places like this, but when you are in a hurry and your options are limited ya do what ya gotta do.  ...   ... The drive thru line was too long, so I went inside. I figured I'd get the two Cheeseburger deal, since they looked small and easy to eat while driving. The customer service was ok and the food came out pretty quick, almost too quick.  Place seemed clean. I don't really feel it's fair to remove stars based on me not liking fast food. This is definitely as good as I expected it to be, which isn't much. ...  ... The first issue that I thought was a little weird. While I was waiting for my food, a father and son came up to order more food. The father asked if she had a side of fruit for his son. She replied no. When she walked away I told him, that it looked like they had apple slices in the kids menu. When she came back he asked her and she said that they did have those. Last I checked apples slices were still fruit, but whatever. He asked how much and she said something like 50 cents or a dollar, then he asked how many came in that serving and she said 2. We both assumed she meant 2 slices... so he ordered like 3-4. When she gave him the 3-4 bags they easily had 4-6 slices in each bag. So I wasn't overly impressed with her knowledge of the menu, and felt that she didn't really seem to be invested in ensuring that she was giving out the correct information. This guy didn't really look like he was on a budget, but still he definitely didn't seem to need all of those apples for one small child.   ... My second issue is that I asked for my cheeseburgers without onions, and when I got in the car and opened up the wrapper, both burgers were covered in chopped onions that were basically impossible to easily remove. Boo!! ... I'm assuming I won't be back until the next time I'm desperate for a quick food fix.  Why can't Five Guys have a drive thru window... sad face.

WORST McDonald's i've ever been to. they put my strawberry shake on the counter and didn't call me for it, even though i was sitting at the stool right by the counter.  they put whipped cream and a cherry on my shake without asking me, so they had to do it over.  ...  ... when i finally got it, my strawberry shake was barely pink in color with what looked like a squirt of vanilla shake on top of it. and as for the taste, there wasn't any. my first job was at McDonalds (one of the best jobs i'ver ever had). our shakes were dark pink and yummy - they didn't SUCK. ...  ... also, they had two managers back there talking about anything but running the restaurant. the floors were dirty and the clientele isn't the best. just another noisy, busy, gas-station stop, impersonal, hole-in-the-wall McDonald's. yuck. will never go back.

Worst McDonalds!!!  ... After waiting at the drive thru for about 5 minutes I had ordered an iced coffee with cream only, when I got it I could tell the coffee wasn't fresh, it had a sour/ bitter taste. I went back through the drive thru, this time waiting about 10 min. to ask for a refund and the lady rudely told me "you said no sugar so of coarse it's going to taste bad!"  ... Really?!? No!! That's how I like my coffee!!  ... Way to start my morning! I will never go back to this location.

I currently view McDonald's as more of a restaurant serving inexpensive snacks than meals. In my opinion, McDonald's is a level or few below the fast food powerhouses starring In N Out, Raising Cane's, and Panda Express. When dinner is far in the horizon and I want to calm my appetite, I order off the McDonald's $1 menu as I look forward to a better meal. The $1 menu features large fountain Coke beverages, a sausage buritto, a hot & spicy chicken sandwich, a double cheeseburger,  small coffee, and other foods. ...  ...    Both my check-ins here were when I hiked on the Angel Park Trail system. This McDonald's is convenient to the Angel Park Trail system; which includes the Bonanza Trail, Kellogg Sport's Complex, and Lone Mountain Trail. The restaurant is a convenient respite from outdoor activities. To reach this McDonald's from the Angel Park Trail system; from Bonanza Trail which is really the east spur of Angel Park Trail to you'd walk past the Kellogg Sport's Complex, walk under the Buffalo Drive tunnel and after the K-Mart turn left on Lone Mountain Trail. After Crossing Washington Avenue with a pedestrian signal, you'd turn left and McDonald's is on the right. ...  ...   As far as location,  I am curious why McDonald's passed over building the restaurant at the corner of Buffalo at Washington. The existing restaurant a few thousand feet east of Buffalo Drive on Washington Avenue is out of sight lines for motorists driving on Buffalo Drive one traffic signal north of Summerlin Parkway. Then again being McDonald's there is another location a couple of traffic lights north at Buffalo and Lake Mead Boulevard.   ...  ...   This is an older McDonald's. This is not surprising considering it is near Kmart. There is no theme. Just a basic McDonald's with a dining and indoor playground area. ...  ...   The two check-ins in this basic McDonald's were for a snack. On my first check-in,  I quaffed down the limited time Chocolate strawberry Frape. It was a yummy caffeine boost at a cost of $4 and 600-plus calories. Fortunately this was the halfway point of my hike and I'd burn some of it off. On my follow-up check-in,  I snacked on a Hot & Spicy Chicken with a large Coke. The Coke was flat. That is a no no! If the service wasn't decent and there wasn't a manager presence, this review would fall flat of 3 stars and sink to 2 stars.  ...  ...   I try to review places when I am a regular. Now that I am a Duke that will probably see that status fade at this location, it is time to emphasize that this is a decent restaurant for a snack or light meal off the Angel Park Trail system and in the vicinity of Washington at Buffalo.

Stopped in for breakfast while attending the Best of the West Lacrosse tournament at Kellogg Zaher Sports Complex. This place was packed with lacrosse people from all over. The long lines inside almost made me turn around and go elsewhere. I'm glad we stayed. The staff behind the counter did a good job of getting through the rush in timely fashion. We were soon chowing down on our McGriddle and sausage burritos. The coffee was actually pretty good for fast food java as was the Chocolate Chip Frappe.  I would not hestitate to visit again, if I am in the area.

Not only did they not have Iced Latte's ready this morning, they also got my order wrong. The dollar menu hash browns include TWO, not ONE. But I guess that's a little difficult for the employees to understand, considering none of them appear to speak any english.

I went to this McDonald's today to redeem a buy 1 get 1 free coupon for their new smoothie. I printed this coupon off from McDonalds.com. When I got to the window to pay, after a 5 minute delay, I was told my coupon would not be accepted since they don't accept corporate coupons. Pretty ridiculous when I get the coupon from their own web site. I hate McDonald's and this just furthers my hate for them. They did not get my business today and they will not get my business in the future. Thanks for SPECTACULAR customer service. What did I expect?

REVIEW #9:  1 stars  (326 chars)
Slowest service ever! And I don't have high expectations for mcdonalds but geez when there's a line with 15+ people you would expect they would put two people on register. They're so understaffed too! The cashier took an order and then went to prepare the food. AGH. ...  ... TLDR; The people here like to work in slow motion.

Worst service EVER!!!!! Not only did they mess up my order but the manager was a jerk. He did not say sorry for messing up my order and gave me a dirty look. Ill NEVER go there again

12:30pm:  The woman who took my order was pleasant enough.  The manager-type who put out my order seemed harried.  Not sure who was responsible but I had to ask for my drinks.  It was the rush hour so I'll give them a break, although I did notice the pick-up counter was getting backed up with people waiting for corrections. ...  ... 2:00pm:  I ordered a sundae for me and a shake for my son.  The man who took my order was very pleasant.  Although  it was not busy at this point, the manager-type still seemed harried and flustered.  I saw her make the shake and then disappear.  The young man who brought out the sundae had to go looking for the shake and found it at the drive-thru window. ...  ... The good parts:  the Playland space was clean and the wifi worked.  Oh yeah, and it was cheap.  The ice cream was very good. ...  ... It just bums me out that I could have gone to In-N-Out, where they always get my order right and they are friendly and efficient.  If it wasn't for Playland, I wouldn't go here.

Slow as a slug, and they usually eff up my order but its ok. ...  ... I continue to go here for sweet teas with lemon, and when I order food they usually forget something Im ok with that. This place has a horribly small through lane if you dont wanna go through th drive thru, SO BEWARE!! We also go here bc they have my sons Mcdonalds night so we go and eat out little ice cream with fries and enjoy the AC. ...  ... The drive through is SOOO SLOW and the workers are usually rude but what do you expect? They hate their job, but please dont forget my lemon in my sweet tea! ...  ... Cheap fatty food, but if youre in a semi rush or dont wanna cook go for it bro!

This place was convenient to me because I planned on doing a little grocery shopping afterwards and it's literally inside of the Walmart at Centennial Center. For a morning I'm usually used to McDonald's being unnecessarily busy, whether it's the drive through or in-store. I guess since this one is located in the Walmart it's not frequented as much as the other ones in town. I walked in and was able to order immediately. ...  ... I've been to countless McDonalds' where they pre-cook the sausage burritos and let them sit for hours, then the tortilla gets hard and it's just not enjoyable. Here, I forgot to ask them not to, but was VERY happy when we got the burritos and they were hot and fresh with soft tortillas. Everything else was pretty standard. I had a sausage egg & cheese mcmuffin that was surprisingly well assembled (but I'm sure this can vary by cook instead of store location) and a coffee that was made how I like it. ...  ... Everyone here was friendly and the dining area was spotless. There isn't much more you could ask for in a McDonalds.

Good service, food orders are always spot-on, and it's quick to boot.  For McDonald's, that seems to be extraordinary! ...  ... But seriously, their Drive-Thru is 24/7 and since it's down the street from my house that's fabulous if I come home in the wee hours.  Or, if I need to grab a quick bite before I drink spirits.  ;) ...  ... There's one guy there that's always extra-friendly and actually checks my ID -- on the back of my card it says "See ID."  A+ to you, dude. ...  ... P.S. Fries have always been crazy fresh (and we all know that's the best thing about McD's!)

REVIEW #3:  3 stars  (653 chars)
Another national chain spot that has no reviews. And with good reason. It's pretty pointless to review a McDonald's. That is, unless you want the FTR! ...  ... McDonald's to me is good for one thing--their dollar menu. I'm a sucker for the $1 McDouble and maybe some fries. On road trips, the $1 one-price-fits-all-sizes fountain drink is priceless. Unfortunately, not all McDonald's locations stick to this pricing structure, but this location certainly does. ...  ... I've never actually been inside, but their drive-thru has the nice face-to-face three-window system. I'm not sure you need that third window just for ordering, but whatever. It works.

I go here so much that I'm starting to never want to go again. It's the closest and cheapest food place to my house.  It's cheap which I love and it's pretty good. It's McDonald's nothing special. Just cheap decent food when I need it. It's really fast too.

Another rippoff but then what are the options for breakfast at 4am. As much as they charge for a Bacon, Egg & Cheese Biscuit and 1 lityle 2-inch piece of Bacon. REALLY? This place sucks and I should have stsyed away.  ... Make sure to count your change too!

REVIEW #8:  1 stars  (580 chars)
I don't understand why an intelligent human being would go to this place and consume the stuff that this place sells. It is of less quality than the stuff they feed inmates at that tent prison in Arizona...literally. What McDonalds does is take some low quality beef, add soy and other mixtures for filler, and then flavor it with addictive chemical flavorings that they make in a lab. Look into it if you don't believe me.  ...  ... I cringe when my kids want to go there. It's so foul and not to mention freaking expensive. It's totally unbelievable to me that people eat there!

Ran through the drive thru today on the way to work for the much advertised "Egg White Delight McMuffin".  250 calories & 7 grams of fat! (versus the regular Egg McMuffin-300 calories and 12 grams of fat)  Oh hells yes!   I am a HUGE fan of the Egg McMuffin and was excited to try this one.  If only McDonalds would serve these breakfast sandwiches all the time and not just the morning my whole darn world would be brighter!  Sigh!  I think I need to start a petition! ...  ... Anyways, back to my sandwich.  The egg was fluffy, light and airy.  Totally not what I expected but hugely amazed at how good it was.  It wasn't dry like I had thought it would be.  The cheese was a white cheese versus the American cheese on the Egg McMuffin.  I didn't notice much different.  Overall the Egg White Delight is probably better than the Egg McMuffin.  Ooops shhhhh did I just say that?   ...  ... The service was alright.  Nothing too crazy but it WAS in the drive thru.  As long as everything comes out as ordered all is good right?  My only complaint which is always my complaint with Micky D's is they never put very much ice in their drinks.  Why is that?  SMH

Swung by here on my way back to work. I wanted something fast and easy and fast is what I got. By the time I got to the second window my food was there. I got a double bacons cheeseburger which was pretty tasty and some french fries. The only down fall was that my food wasn't as hot as I would of liked. I think it was sitting under a heat lamp for some time.

I am giving this place 1 star for a very good reason.  I've been to this place twice now approx 2-3 weeks apart, on my way to work very early in the morning. Once inside, and once in the drive thru.  I think I had the same person take my order both times.  Well BOTH times my order was messed up.  How do you screw up breakfast????? ...  ... First time I was there I told him I wanted the new egg white mcmuffin with the white cheese ( I even POINTED to the huge pictures they have displayed on the wall)  and i want sausage.  When I opened it up, there was american cheese on it.   ...  ... When I went the 2nd time in the drive thru, I ordered a sausage egg biscuit and a sausage egg white muffin with the white cheese, and a hashbrown. I had a buy one get one coupon and my total was only $2.40 I knew right then he messed it up.  Sure enough, I pay and open my bag and there was canadian bacon on my sandwich instead of sausage and no egg on my sausage egg biscuit.   ...  ... Both times I was the only person there. I'd hate to see what kind of mistakes they make when their busy.   ...  ... GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER!!!! Making a breakfast sandwich isn't rocket science. !!!!

REVIEW #7:  1 stars  (326 chars)
I usually stop by here between the hours of 1am-3am due to my work schedule & the guy who I always see will not only take my order at the speaker, but will also repeat it to me at the window, but wrong so don't bother even ordering at the speaker.  Also they conveniently only take cash during the hours I visit. Pretty weird.

There is a lot to be said about this McDonald's. The chicken is great. I love the fresh fruit in the yogurt parfait and if you ever give me hot fries you will see me do my odd but strange happy dance. And this McDonald's has seen the dance of I'm so happy I just have no shame dance about a million times. Oh and the ice creme cones are only a dollar bill. Sure they are extra busy at this location but that's a Plus can u say hot and ready food.

REVIEW #2:  5 stars  (3188 chars)
We just celebrated my sons 2nd birthday at this particular location and the party was AMAZING!!  ...  ... I know when you think of McDonald's, no big deal right? Well, this one is special! Since we have a very rambunctious 2 year old we have tested almost every McDonald's Playland in the city - this one passes the test with him! We were looking for a location to hold his 2nd birthday and we were running short on ideas since many of the things to do in Las Vegas/Henderson are geared toward older children. In my search for a birthday location I found this McDonalds on a website that lists all the great playgrounds/playlands in the city and it had many great reviews so I called to ask if they did birthday parties and unfortunately (at the time I called) they said that they did not. I was seriously bummed - and continued on with my search. One day we decided to take our son to this McDonalds just to burn some energy. I swear once we walked through the sliding glass doors and my son saw the playland, it was like the heavens opened up and his eyes got HUGE!! So much to do, so little time! This McDonalds was perfect for him, it is equally split between a toddler area (4 years and under) and their normal ginormous playland for older kids (4-99.) The playland is immaculate and obviously very well cared for. I decided to ask again if they hosted birthday parties and the manger said yes they did! I was ecstatic, we had found our perfect party location! It turns out they were doing birthdays and had stopped for a while and JUST started doing them again around my sons birthday...lucky us! All that was required of us at the time was a small deposit of $40 and a guesstimated count of how many children will be attending.  ...  ... The day of my sons birthday was flawless, not a hitch and and not an issue that might be expected of a fast food restaurant. I got to the location early to decorate and to my (totally pleasant) surprise it was already decorated and I had my own "hostess" to help me with whatever I needed help with. Our party had separate seating with balloons, party hats and a banner. Our hostess went around and took individual orders and took care of EVERYTHING which allowed me to really socialize with the parents and spend precious birthday time with my son. We had an equal amount of toddlers and older kids and they were equally having fun. After we all ate (the norm Micky D's selection of food) the hostess brought out a cake large enough for all of us and ice cream too. It was time for the bill and I was so surprised to find that I was only asked to pay for the individual meals we ordered and anything beyond that was just a part of having the party there. All in all it was a fabulous day, my son had a wonderful time and so did his guests. I am so glad I decided to ask if they did birthday parties again!!  ...  ... **On a side note, we took our son to this same location to meet Ronald McDonald a few weeks before his party and we were able to meet the franchise owner of this particular location. She was very hospitable and cared very much about the children there. It is very clear why this particular McDonalds is so well taken care of.

I have passed through this restaurant over 10x on my way to appointments and I finally stopped to have a meal. The staff is very pleasant and friendly. The location is small and I feel they could utilize the space more effectively to seat more people. The restaurant has a children's play area which I think is great cause kids hate to wait. The food storage area is right near the children's play area so I don't think that's to safe. The tables are very nicely set and simple except very small so if yore ordering a lot you may find yourself crowded. Our food took half an hour to be served after ordering. I only seen 1chef on the griddle so that was the hold up.  ... The Crpe: we ha the Canada and Switzerland an it was so delicious. The expresso coffee was on point! I recommend everyone stop in and try it, it's worth the wait. The prices are reasonable and affordable. They make to go bags also!! I live in Blue Diamond NV so you know it's worth it if I drive that far on non appointment days. By the way upstairs of the restaurant has tons of Boutiques and shops. My personal favorite is BOX Human landscapers. Check them out !!

This location is a really nice McDs.  What a pleasant surprise! ...  ... I was in the area running some errands when my daughter wanted lunch.  I always cave in due to my ridiculous love of McNuggets, so we popped in for lunch.  The place was busy, but everything seemed to be flowing at a nice pace.  We didn't have to wait too long to order or for our food, which is always nice with a hungry toddler.  When we did get our food, it was piping hot and super yummy!  And I do know it is bad for me, but those gosh darn McNuggets, I tell you they have cast a spell on me! ...  ... Now the real reason we go to McDs is so my daughter can play and interact with other little ones since she is an only child...So I really gauge my writing on how nice the play area is at each McDs, in all honesty.   ...  ... First off, the play area was really clean.  I wasn't afraid to let my daughter go play.  I didn't feel the need to put her in a biohazard suit, so that is a big plus. This McDs has a huge play area with 2 sections for extra fun.  They have your regular climbing tubes and slides for your bigger kids.  If your toddlers are climbers, like my little monkey, they can handle these tubes fine as well.  The have a mini slide for extra little ones as well, which is nice because they don't have to be around all of the big kids, if they are on  the timid side.  They also had a whole separate climbing section that toddlers or big kids could play on.  It is nice for the kiddos to have so many play options.   ...  ... There was also a lot of seating, so we didn't have to fight for a seat.  It isn't fun to have to stand and wait for someone to leave just so you can sit down. ...  ... Overall, this is a nice fast food place.  Go check it out, if you need a quick bite to eat or have kids you need to wear out for their nap.

I brought my son here to grab a quick bite to eat one very hot afternoon. It was nice that they have the air conditioned indoor play ground that seemed pretty clean. The food of course, isn't the healthiest but they do have better choices now. I got my son the apple slices instead of frys, and juice instead of soda. Of course he preferred to play then eat so he just ate when we got back home. ...  ... I had the honey mustard grilled chicken mini meal, which was just average.

The drive thur here can be nuts depending on the time of day. Watch out for the jerks that think they can come in from the back side of the drive thru when it's busy too! And if you're one of the jerks that lets them in when people have been waiting in line, I will yell at you or flip my hands up at you, it's not a zipper people ( you know how a zipper works)  ...  ... The play area is a favorite for my kids.  ...  ... Here is the trick for super hot fries: Order them with no salt. This way they have to drop a whole new basket, because the other fries are all salted! Then you get the hottest fries ever! You can add the salt yourself!  ... Just don't do this in the drive thru because it holds up the line, and yes, you guessed it, I will yell at you!!!!

REVIEW #10:  2 stars  (2918 chars)
I used to spend a lot of time eating drive thru. We are talking 3 times a day, 7 days a week. During that three years, I ate here at least 4 times a week, between breakfast, lunch and dinner. About 10 months ago I stopped eating fast-food all together, including McDonald's. At that time, the level of service that this particular McDonald's provided was on a slow decline. ... It started when I made the shift from double quarter pounders to grilled chicken salads. frequently, hell almost every time, I would not get utensils in my bag. So, I started asking at the speaker and at each window for utensils. Every time, I would get down the road, be rummaging through my bag, only to find that again I had no fork. ... My troubles did not stop there. Twice I got a salad, only to find that I could not eat it because the chicken was under cooked. If you know anything about working at McDonald's like I do (I worked my first job for 4 years at a McDonald's in KY), then you know it is hard to under cook grilled chicken. It is almost something you have to do deliberately. None the less, I am patient, so I did not complain. ... Periodically towards the end of my fast-food stent, the service level was going in the you know whatter. They had hired some 'new recruits' who were obviously to young and cool to care about the customers that they serve. I got full flavor of the chips on their shoulders every time i drove through. I knew that I was coming to the end of my fast food stage, so I just let it go and stopped eating fast food. ... Now, three days ago my brothers (who i live with), wanted to get McDonald's for dinner. I wound up getting it for them, though I was not getting any myself, cause I'm just that kinda guy. I go through drive thru, like always, and I can't believe it. Not only did I wait at the speaker for almost 3 minutes before anyone picked up, while there were no cars in front of me, but when I got around to pay, there was nobody at EITHER window. I waited, and waited, and waited some more. Finally after another 4 minutes, someone came to the second window scolding me for not stopping at the first window (which for the record I did stop for about 2 minutes). They were obviously having a bad day, and for whatever reason decided to take it out on yours truly. But that is not all. I finally get the food, make the short 2 minute trip home, get in the house, give my brothers the food, start telling them the horror story of our once favorite burger joint, and they stop me. They stop me to tell me that the food was so cold that they could not eat it. We wound up having spaghetti because it was just not eatable. Fail. ... I waited, hoping that I would just get over it, like I always to, but my voice has to be heard. This is simply outrageous. To think that in 10 short months, a restaurant can go from a family favorite to the worst place in the area is just unsatisfactory. Fail

This McDonald's is in my neighborhood, so I wind up going there on a fairly regular basis to grab food for the family. It's usually busy, but my main issues have been with the drive-through service. Two out of the last three times I have gone through, I have had to go into the restaurant to get items that I had paid for but were omitted from my order. For some reason it usually seems to be a Happy Meal (which I order for my grandson). On one occasion they left it out but gave me the milk I ordered with it. The second time they gave me a small iced tea with it (which I didn't order), charged me $1.29 for the milk that was supposed to come with the Happy Meal at no cost, and left out the Happy Meal itself.

Great job, guys.   You just lost a rave, 5 star review and a loyal customer. ...  ... My husband goes twice a week at least after working out to get a soda and a cup of water.  Cup of water is always free EVERYWHERE, until now...now you have to pay $1 for the cup (which is extra dumb, because a cup of soda there is $1...I guess soda's free and we're just paying for cups at McDonalds). ...  ... I'd understand if he just walked in and asked for free water, but he was a paying customer, and they know him there as he's a regular. ...  ... Also, very convenient that they suddenly start charging for tap water right when the hot summer weather hits.  Shameful.

I used to love this McDonald's and it's actually a few cents cheaper then the one on cenntenial. After yesterday though I will no longer support this store.  ...  ... My wife stopped by hear yesterday to get myself and a few of my troops lunch then bring it out to us at work. Placing the order went fine and she got the food. Since it was a large order and she had to drive it out to us 20 minutes away she didn't stop to check it.  ...  ... When she delivered the food we found that a double quarter pounder was missing. No big deal I've been missing food from McDonald's before and gone back to get it. No not today when my wife gets to McDonald's and shows them the receipt and explains what happens they refuse to do anything about it. The manager tells my wife it's her fault for not checking the order for leaving. Isn't it your employees jobs to make sure the prder is completely filled out before you hand it to the customer?  ...  ... Now I'm out $5 because the manager refused to refund or give my wife another burger. Well we called the complaint line about it and complained thinking maybe we will be able to get them to send us a gift card for $5 or something, nope that's not happening either. So now we are out $5 for food we didn't even get. I know $5 isn't much but it's the fact that the store did nothing to right the wrong.

Out of all carbonated drinks and it's not the firs time. And when I asked for a lemonade they wants to charge me extra. I told them that was not fair and over 59 cents they refused. Add to that they are always on a long wait and don't have a great track record for getting food orders correctly, why go there. I went at 7:30 on a Sunday  March 6th 2014 so hopefully someone reads this and has a talk with the brainiac manager working that doesn't realize all their customers r regulars and u should be better to them. I guess because the name is McDonalds they don't have to take care of us. Oh if u want to call because of anything including wrong orders, no answer.

They just can't follow direction in getting an order right. If these kids are our future...we're in trouble.

Not a lot I can say because I seriously visit McDonald's locations for one thing only: the Vanilla Reduced Fat Ice Cream Cone! It is very delicious, just one dollar (range between 99 cents to $1.29, not including sales tax), and just 170 calories! I cannot complain. We went through the Drive-Thru for our first visit and it went smoothly. Short wait with just 3-4 cars ahead of us. Clear speaker, the associate asked us to verify our order on the screen (great!), and there were separate windows for paying and receiving your food. Everyone was very cordial as well. I'll be back!

Pretty new McDonald's, used to be a KFC. It's nicely renovated and designed but tables are often not wiped and cleaned and last time I was there, they had no more ketchup next to the soda. This place is run by mostly by teenagers. Menu is displayed on techy monitors which I love. Management could be better. Room for improvement. Nothing amazing but not bad.

REVIEW #3:  2 stars  (976 chars)
Knowing how bad the drive through service has been I went inside and placed an order for a burger. The lobby wasn't trashed but in a need of a sweep and a wipe down.  ...  ... I ordered my Habanero Quarter Pounder and sat at one of the only clean tables in the store. The register guy did come out to sweep and while he did try his best I have to wonder why he choose to move the chairs at my table and sweep below my feet (remember that it was the only clean table in the store) and ignore what I'm only guessing was a hunk of apple on the floor at the table across from me or the fry and salt residue on the seats of the same table? He even went so far as to pick up a stack of napkins from the floor and put them onto the table top.  ...  ... I know I know young kid working his first job trying so hard but he/they desperately need to go back to the McDonald University and get some remedial training or this store is going to fail to earn repeat business from its locals.

REVIEW #4:  1 stars  (425 chars)
By far the WORST McDonald's I've ever been to!!!  If I could give it less then one star I would.  I live right down the street so this is the easiest McDonald's to get to, but ever time I go the wait is ridiculous, the serve is horrible, and the food is thrown together!  I suggest everybody go to the McDonald's off rainbow instead because it going to take just as long either way.   And their staff is a lot more friendly!!

REVIEW #5:  1 stars  (1044 chars)
Do I have to give them 1 star you all should consider this a negative star.Absolutely the worst fast food service I've ever experienced.Every order I've gotten has been in some way or the other wrong.i check every order but I'm not opening boxes n unwrapping sandwiches.Today I ordered an egg n cheese Mc muffin got em home n they put ham on em.the worst one was couple of months back they had those wings n I ordered them n sat at window for 7 min been in line for 10 then Mgr asks me to pull up to wait in s designated space .I'm just sitting there before I realize I've been there another 10 min and there are no cars in line. I drove over to front door went in an there's the Mgr sitting at a dinning room table eating.i asked her where my food was that I've been waiting for 15 minutes outside.i was so mad I just took my food n left.2 months later stupid me went back for another screw up.Buy the way this Mgr is on duty 90 percent of time I go there.I was a Mgr for 20 years in fast food n sit down I wouldn't hire this lady as a cashier

REVIEW #6:  1 stars  (2886 chars)
I was so excited for this McDonalds to open, it's about time we get a food place in that location. So you can imagine my disappointment with their terrible service and bad quality food making!! ...  ...  Worst. Worst. Worst. I get they are new. I do, so the first few times I went, I kept my cool, didn't complain, smiled, etc.  ...  ... I like to go mid-morning on my way to work for either just coffee and a Sausage McMuffin with no egg... How complicated of an order can it be??!! Sometimes I will mix it up and get a combo meal, this is usually where they royally screw it up.  ...  ... I'm irritated just thinking about the visits Ive had and how 4 out of 5 visits they screwed something up.  ...  ... To make this brief, here are my major issues.  ...  ... I order Splenda to be added to my drink. I'm in my work clothes, and I don't want to pull over and carefully add it myself and spill on my clothes since they A) they always fill it too high, and B) I don't want to make any more stops!  ...  ... Cheese: hardly ever melted on the Quarter Pounder, or Big Mac and I've tried about 3 or 4 times. Cheese not melted, or the tiniest blob of sauce! I wanted the new habanero ranch, couldn't even taste the sauce except for one bite! Plus it was luke-warm at least twice! The hot & spicy with a tiny splash of mayo? I mean, really!  ...  ... I ordered an iced Caramel Mocha, get to the window, she hands me the latte, it had no caramel on the whip, so I ask, is this the Caramel Mocha? She stares at me blankly and says yes, I say, I'm used to it having caramel on top, she says its a caramel mocha, so off to work I go, I'm already late because they are super SLOW, and sure enough take a sip after I'm gone and it's a regular mocha. Pathetic service! ...  ... I did write in to corporate after my 8th or 10th attempt to do business there.. And the manager called me and apologized. Told me to come in and get a free combo on him. So not happening. Go in so they can remember me as the Girl who called them out for their shit slow service, always messing up my orders,  and crap food making? No thanks. I would have rather had some coups sent so I could remain anonymous.  ...  ... Oh well. I just drive a few more blocks down to Rainbow and Blue Diamond location if i have the extra time, they are great!  ...  ... As for this place? Shame on you for STILL not being able to get your shit together!  ...  ... One positive note I will say is there are two very friendly employees there. They work the drive thru taking orders/$$ I wish I had their names!  ...  ... Will I be back? Sadly probably yes, it's very convenient for me on my way to work when I don't have time to go to rainbow location.. But I limit what I get, try to keep it simple and always hope for the best... Maybe someday they will be a great location... As for now? The McDonald's Corporation would be ashamed!!!

REVIEW #7:  1 stars  (450 chars)
ok so yes they are new and yes it looks nice inside,but every time i go there my food is always i mean always wrong,and to make it ever worse is when you ask them to fix it and they still get it wrong, Thats pretty bad. And there are a few mangers there that just need to quit or be fired,they are rude ,they interrupt you when your tring to explain what was wrong.How does a sausage egg mcmuffin with no cheese turn into a ham egg and cheese biscut.

REVIEW #8:  1 stars  (1148 chars)
This is got to be one of the worse McDonald's ever, even surpassing the McDonalds In Hawthorn Nevada! ...  ... Stopped there two times in two days, I was sick and didn't want to cook or get out of the car. Plus, as a child when I got sick my mother would buy me a Big Mac. ...  ... Anyway, we stopped and went thru the drive thru, it was pretty quick both times. Our larger truck fit through, so that is a good thing. ...  ... The first trip, my husband, also sick, drove off as soon as the food was handed to us. I'm all like what are doing? I haven't tried the fries yet! Anyway, the fries were either over cooked,( I don't think so), or cooked twice. The amount of salt was unreal and the fries were cooked beyond crispy. ...  ... Second trip, the fries looked like McDonalds fries just not very warm, and yes he drove off before I tried one. We get back to the R.V. resort we're staying at and I try my Big Mac, almost no sauce and very bland. The patties also look like they have gotten smaller. ...  ... The two ladies at the window were not overly friendly but not rude either. If you want a burger just stop at In and Out across the street.

Heading home, I made a quick stop here to pick up a McFlurry for dessert.  Service was prompt, the restaurant was clean, and about the only thing to diminish my enjoyment of the McFlurry was the woman talking on her cell phone at about 120 decibels.  After a few strategic glares from me, she took it outside. ...  ... I generally don't stop at thisMcDonald's, but given the circumstances and the fact I was heading home, it made a good place to get dessert! ...  ... And, there's free wifi.

I watched this place as well as everything along durango by the park go up. i remember when it used to be a dirt lot.  ...  ... Great location. SUPER convenient when need a fast and quick bite. Chevron is right there attached as well.  ...  ... Out of the many years its been open, i've only had 1 issue and it was so long ago, i dont remember what happened. I just remember they gave me more food as an apology.. Haha.  ...  ... Drive thru usually pretty fast.

The employees here totally love their jobs; I can tell. They are just so enthusiastic about working at McDonalds and they just can't contain it. If they were in a Disney movie, there would be one heck of a musical number about it. ...  ... Alright, not really. But they work at McDonalds. Can you really blame them for being blas about it? ...  ... The wait in the drive thru is almost always pretty long. The food is standard McDonalds food. I haven't had any issues with my order being incorrect.

REVIEW #6:  2 stars  (324 chars)
So when I checked in here, there was a wait at the drive thru and I was looking over reviews and I couldn't imagine a McDonald's being THAT bad. Well.. It was. No pickles on my burger, my drink had no ice and wasn't full, and the fries were lukewarm at best. Next time I'll be headed to the location on buffalo and flamingo.

REVIEW #7:  2 stars  (671 chars)
They are getting better instead of everytime messing my order its almost everytime I go inside everytime now because if you go through the drive through theywil mess your order up....this lady a few days ago was so confident she got my order right she watched me go through my bag (like i did somethin wrong) and praised herself on gettin the order right but  YOU DIDNT!!! my onions were still wrong after "ya ya i got this" but you didnt cuz you were to busy with something else and not listening....I really believe everyone in this location severly puffs the ganga b4 work  cuz they can never get it! Not that i blame them BUT i still pay for it so GET IT TOGETHER!!!!

Came here with my husband and my daughter. While giving my order (with my family next to me), the MANAGER named Ricardo, kept WINKING at me. Yes, the manager. Not once but many times.  ...  ... it took everything in me to calm my husband down and not let him deck the guy. I told my husband that I would report it.  ...  ... Getting home, I called and reported the situation to corporate. they said I would receive a call from someone immediately. ...  ... Tori, the district manager called me the next day and gave me the lamest excuse Ive ever heard. Her exact words were, "Well, he does that to everyone, its just who he is. I mean, he even winks at me all the time and I'm not eve a pretty woman." Um, okay?! How does this make it right. i was furious and told her so. She continued to defend his actions saying he does it all the time. Excuse me, but I was a manager at a restaurant once upon a time and 1. winking is considered sexual harassment. 2. Its not appropriate for him to do that to a customer and definitely not his boss, the district manager. If he is allowed to do that and get a way with it, I can't imagine what he does to the female workers under him. ...  ... Called corporate again and yet, again nothing done. Not even an apology. ...  ... Used to come here all the time for a happy meal for my little girl but now i will NEVER come back to this mcdonalds and maybe never give another mcdonalds a chance. This situation made me sick and uncomfortable.

I don't like giving bad reviews, but this is the WORST McDonalds EVER. This isn't a one time thing either, constant mistakes, wrong orders (and I'm not altering my order in any way)...seriously? How hard is it to just get it right?!!!

REVIEW #10:  1 stars  (448 chars)
I went into this Mc Donalds bec there was 12 cars in the drive thru and when I got inside.. it was complete chaos !! It took 4 people to fig out how to work the register, while the fry machine was beeping beeping beeping .... One girl was texting on her cell phone and with 5 people in line, the young inexperienced manager went and sat down in the rest. and got on phone.  They were rude and it was unacceptable !! Horrible service and products !!

Pulled in. Said my order. The guy completely butchered it and treated me like I was a stupid idiot for ordering an iced latte! Screen showed wrong so I tried to correct him. No answer for a solid 4 min of sitting there. Then he rudely says are you going to pull up? From there... Didn't charge the right amount and was more concerned with talking about a party with this guy behind him. From there... I pull up (wrong order).... Ask for what I ordered and got the wrong thing again. Props to the girl at the second window apologizing and so on but still c'mon 1 freAking iced latte!!!

REVIEW #12:  1 stars  (365 chars)
These people want us to raise min wage to 15 an hour when they can't get a simple order right and then argue about it ? You can't even do the basic essentials of a simple task. You put in the order and give the customer what they paid for. Not argue with them. This is why they won't raise your pay because you can't do your job right. You get paid what you put in.

I know I'm going to lose any credibility I've built for this review but I don't care. Why a 5 stars?  Because I can't give six stars for my beloved 99c soft serve ice cream. It's the best desert I can think of after any meal. If I could purchase their machine and recipe for the ice cream, It would be sitting in my kitchen this minute.  ...  ... 99c for 99 calories of perfect treat. I know there are tons of soft serve ice cream out there but Micky D makes it just right to my taste. Packed at least 6 inches high on a tiny cone. It's not to watery, not too creamy. Not too soft and not too hard. Not too sweet. It takes me 10 minutes to get through the whole cone and I do savor those 10 minutes. How many deserts can you think of that takes more than 3 minutes to devour. Pies, cakes, puddings, cookies nope! Ah..If only I can have a cone now... ...  ... (Note: That's why I befriended Mike P.

I work in this area, and so sometimes I'll stop by here to get food when I haven't brought anything from home. Gotta say, they have gotten a lot of new staff and it's really nice now! Clean, fast, and satisfying. ...  ... I usually do large orders because I order for myself and some of my co-workers. The employees are patient and usually try to tweek my order so that I can get the best price for my food. Everyone's pretty nice, too. ...  ... Their drive-thru is really busy around noon, and totally not worth using. But in the mornings and late at night, it's super fast and no one has ever forgotten my straws, napkins, or ketchup. ...  ... I'm lovin' it!

I stopped in to pick up a side salad to take home rather than make a salad from scratch.  The line at the drive through went very slowly.  I should have parked and walked in. ...  ... The salad was fresh and with my own dressing it made a great addition to my meal. ...  ... The only problem I have with this McDonald's is the ease of getting in and out.  It isn't easy.  because of the way it sits in Boca Park, the drive through is in the back and you need to watch traffic going to other stores in the next section.  It's not the most easy space.

McDonald's is my go to breakfast joint when I go golfing in the morning.  I grab a couple of Sausage McMuffin's with Cheese so I can fill up before a round of golf.  Since I was golfing at the Badland's Golf Course nearby, I dropped by this location.  I went through the drive thru and it was very fast and efficient and they got my order correct. ...  ... Overall, A-OK for a fast food joint. ...  ... Return Factor - 50%

REVIEW #10:  2 stars  (361 chars)
Disappointed. Again, another Summerlin McD's just doesn't cut it. The burgers were tasty (and at least not dry) but not hot. They were just a bit over room temperature. Granted, business was slow when we arrived, with only two other guests. Not sure if we will come back here again. If we do, maybe we should take our food home and microwave it just a bit. Ugh.

REVIEW #11:  2 stars  (330 chars)
exactly what the stars say. MEH. i realize that it is just mcdonalds, but i have definitely experienced better. everytime i come through here the employees are very monotonous and the fries are cold. seriously, the fries are the best part of mcdonalds; the least you could do is give me a decent order of hot, salty deliciousness!

REVIEW #12:  2 stars  (640 chars)
I payed a visit to this location's drive thru today and really wasn't impressed. ...  ... When I arrived at the window to pay for the order I placed the guy opened the window and just stared at me. I had to ask him how much I owed so that I could pay for my order. I guess he just assumed I could understand anything he might have uttered through their high quality drive thru speakers. ...  ... The drive through service was extremely slow. This is one of those places that make you wish you would have parked and walked in because you probably would have gotten your food faster. ...  ... The food was typical McDonalds...nothing special.

This one was attached to the gas station here at my corner and I've never been inside, and even though I like McDonalds. I rarely eat here except for bkfst once a week, on my way to work.  But I had to stop in and get my filling of McRib (YEA BABY) :-)  When I walked inside, it was actually VERY nice looking.  It didn't look like the typical McDonalds dining room.  It had beautiful cushion benches/booths and it was quiet too. You would've thought you were in a nice coffee house.   ...  ... The price for my McRib was $1.99 each (which seemed like a fair price) I had that and a medium fry and an order of chocolate chip cookies (I love their cookies).   ...  ... I got home, the sandwiches were hot and yummmmmmmmyyy. Fries were just ok, and the cookies were really good too.   ...  ... If I just wanted to get out sometime and go for a coffee or a small treat or bkfst. I would definitely go and relax in their dining room.

Drive through is pretty fast.  ... I came with my friends, just wanting a few sodas. Drove up, ordered 2 diet pepsis and an unsweetened ice tea with extra ice. They didn't repeat the order, so I was kinda unsure if they got my order right. Sure enough, they gave me a sweetened tea (lacking ice). Of course I didn't notice until we had left the area so, there was no point in going back. Kinda disappointed that they can't get an order of 3 soft drinks correct.

I actually visited the McDonads inside the Walmart across the street from this place. I couldn't check in because it was attached to the Walmart..? ...  ... Anyway, Walmart McDonalds are the stingiest. Extra price for everything. ...  ... They have this cool deal though. 20 nuggets, 2 large fries, 2 large drinks for $10. Not bad if you're in the mood for nuggets. ...  ... Other than that, go to a different Mickey D's.

Anyways...I never eat at McDonald's but had a hankerin' one morning for hot cakes.  I was a little perplexed walking in, however, because the decor was really modern and...tasteful.  Not what you expect from a McDonald's.  A+ franchisee, A+. ...  ... Also, I learned a great thing, the greatest thing I learned in all of August 2012.  McDonald's now serves dipped cones!

This place absolutely sucks. Every time I come here, Every Time, they screw up my order. My worst experience here was when I stopped by for a late night snack and they forgot an order of nuggets that they charged me for. i drive back around and they just closed and wouldn't even open the window to listen to me. I understand its a safety thing but they still took my money and didn't give me my food. Management was apologetic but never offered me either my money back or to give me my food. I was over it and didn't want to waste anymore time on this place.

This McDonald's is located in the Midway section of Circus Circus where the circus acts are performed and kids games played. ...  ... I believe the prices are the same as regular McDonald's locations.  They are not priced higher just because they are located inside a Hotel Casino in Vegas.  So that's a good thing. ...  ... There are plenty of tables for seating.  Nice spot to getaway from some of the craziness in the casino and/or children's games.

HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE SERVICE!!! They gave me half my order and told me I would be called again when the rest of my order was ready.  Well I was never called so when I went up to the counter to inquire about my order, the employee was very rude and claimed I was called several times which is a lie because I was waiting at the counter. I had to go back to the counter when I realized those idiots forgot to give me my drink cups and I was scolded that I should've asked for my drink cups when I picked up my food. As I was walking away they were loudly talking $ht about me. UNBELIEVABLE!

I would never usually review a McDonalds, but here's why this place rules: ... 1) $5 for a 20 pack of Chicken McNuggets at 3am. When everything else in the food court was closed, we had this trusty option which ended up being our "go to". I couldn't imagine how extra hungover I would've been each morning without this grease. ... 2) An alternative to overpriced breakfast at the buffet at the hotel. ... 3) A quick way of grabbing something for less than $5 when not needing a full meal during the day. ...  ... 5 stars for that!

This McD's wasn't too bad. Not too busy when we went to grab some late breakfast. You can't beat the dollar menu either. $1 salad from there is nutritionally equivalent to eating something from Quiznos (which my friend had in the food court and hated) at a fraction of the price.

This McDonald's is located inside the Excalibur hotel and was one of the worst experiences I've ever had at a Mickey D's. We wanted a quick breakfast at around 9:30 a.m., so my friend decided to grab some for us to bring back to the room before heading out for the day. He ended up waiting over 30 minutes in line to get 2 egg Mcmuffins and coffee, and I had to wander out of the room to see what the hold up was. There was also no dollar menu available when we were there, so we ended up paying the $3 for a greasy sandwich. By the time we got the food back to the room it was cold, but at least the coffee stayed warm.

Horrible service!! Not friendly at all. I asked for a couple of sauces, they told me I would have to pay 52 cents! What happened to customer service? Worst mcdonalds I have been too. Cheesy move on their part. Giving them one star is being generous

REVIEW #10:  1 stars  (924 chars)
Just an unpleasant experience. I live here in Las Vegas and will often take family to the Strip when they come to town. We were looking for a late night bite to eat and decided on McDonald's since it was right in the hotel. The servers were incredibly rude. My aunt had only asked if they were serving smoothies and the girl behind the register rolled her eyes and responded with an attitude. After receiving our food, I had asked another employee where I could find straws. She intentionally ignored me upon my first attempt to get her attention. When she finally turned around after talking to her friend, she acted as if I was burdening her. ...  ... Maybe I'm expecting too much from a fast food place on the Strip, but I feel that if you are working in customer service, you should be providing customer service, not acting as if you are still in high school and hanging onto that angsty teenager we all have inside us.

REVIEW #11:  1 stars  (2789 chars)
On Christ almighty here it goes. If I am going to eat overpriced McDonalds in a casino I better get what the hell I want to eat. This place is so pitiful just thinking about it makes me angry. I don't even know where to start! Besides Starbucks and Krispy Kreme this is your only option for late night eats at The Excalibur. Here it goes: ...  ... Visit #1: Fool me once...shame on you. ... My husband and I head to the room early our first night in Vegas because we were tired after a long drive. After watching some TV my husband said he wanted a little something from our local McDonalds. I was not really hungry but I was craving a little something sweet so I asked him to get me a McFlurry and to call me and tell me what kind they have. He calls and they have Oreo, M&M, and Butterfinger. YUM! I want Butterfinger I exclaimed! He hangs up and calls back about a minute later to break the news to me that they are out of Butterfinger. That would've been useful info to have when he first asked! So I ended up with Oreo. He comes back and I take a bite of my McFlurry. For those who may not know a McFlurry is soft serve icecream mixed with whatever topping you get. How do you possibly mess that up? Messing up a McFlurry is equal to the stupidity of burning cornflakes! There is no excuse. I took one bite and threw it away. The icecream was warm and the oreo chucks were stale. NASTY! My husband's burger and fries turned out ok at least.  ...  ... Visit #2: Fool me twice....shame on me.  ... After some late night gambling I was hungry and did not feel like searching for late night eats so I ventured into this hell hole again. I figured since I was getting regular food this time it would be ok. The customer service of this place is atrocious. You are pretty much the only 24 hour operation that offers more than donuts and coffee so change your attitude. My husband had a sweet tooth this time and wanted a McFlurry. Dun Dun Dun! I order my food and ask for a Oreo McFlurry and the guy behind the counter proceeds to tell me that the icecream machine is locked. Excuse me? WTF? I call my hubby and tell him and he is most displeased. After two minutes of straight  cursing he asks for chocolate chip cookies, they have none. The only had oatmeal raisin which I can only describe is the asshole of cookies. So literally they have no good desserts. So my poor baby goes without what he wants. We are not doughnut fans so Krispy Kreme is not really appealing. After that I was done with that place for good! ...  ... If you are ok with McDonalds go to the one at The Luxor. You will probably get better service. We should've.  If you want something better venture into NYNY into America cafe which is open 24 hours and for the same price you can get some decent food and service.

REVIEW #13:  1 stars  (466 chars)
This is by far the worst service I have ever had in any fast food restaurant. ...  ... Now I understand that working fast food isn't easy, but having a burger tossed at me was the end of the line. Enough said, so upset that I tossed right back at the rude ass lady behind the counter. If you can wait a couple more feet, there are way more options than this pile of dump. The only thing worse than having to walk through the Excalibur, is walking by that stink hole.

REVIEW #14:  1 stars  (742 chars)
This place is a joke! It's disgusting enough of a fact that the only thing to eat at Excalibur between the hours of 0200 and 0600 is McDonald's, Starbucks, and Krispy Kreme. But then, to be forced to go to McDonald's and find this pitiful excuse of an establishment instead.... for shame. The first night they ran out of Butterfinger topping for a McFlurry. The second night, they claimed their ice cream machine was "locked." Not broken.... but locked. WTF is that?!?! If you are the only late night eatery available, you better have all your menu items available because I have a bit of a sweet tooth. This place is a joke... do yourself a favor and walk across the footbridge to New York New York and eat at America, their late night cafe.

Normally I wouldn't bother with a fast food joint, but every time I come here my orders are consistently messed up.

Seriously I do not know why I bother with this place other than it's the closest fast food to where I live.  So many fails it's unbelievable.

Even though they had someone call me about it they actual place didn't seem to improve.   Just skip it.

Went there on a Sunday afternoon.  It was only moderately busy. But only one cashier (Jessica Carter) taking orders. She complained that kids in general in restaurant were screaming too loud and that she was too busy to accurately take our orders. Waited more than 20 minutes for our food. The order as placed on tray was incorrect.  A new low in fast food...

Had to use the drive thru, because I was on a road trip with my puppies, and it is just too darn hot in NV to leave them in the car for any reason.  That said, I got an iced coffee and some fries, as that was all I could find on the menu that was vegetarian.  Now I remember why I don't go here.  Then I realized, if I could have only found a Taco Bell, I could have had real food!

I been there many times because I use to go to school down the street from there and every single time, every single time, they gave me the wrong order or didn't give me my drink or had to wait 20 minutes for my order. To make it worst the drive thru is not fast by any means either, ur looking at at least 15 minutes over the limit. It's on a busy location but they don't seem to care because the place is always dirty, napkins on the floor and ketchup all over the tables; to make it worse the restrooms are disgusting. If you are hungry don't go here at all, at all!!! No customer service and dirty as hell location

This is the newest McDonald's in North Las Vegas, and possibly the Vegas Valley. In similar fashion to newly opened businesses, this one starts out on a clean slate. ...  ...    The atmosphere is upbeat because everything is brand new and clean. With the newness, there is some neat features. The one that stands out is a screen similar to the DMV that flashes your order number when it is ready. In similar fashion to new and remodeled McDonald's, there is a McCafe and indoor playground.. ...  ...   The employees appear cheerful. The service was fast and friendly. ...  ...   I am a fan of new businesses. Especially new McDonald's that are upbeat restaurants. I bestow the newest North Las Vegas McDonald's with 4-stars.

This McDonald's gets bonus points for its newness factor.  There's also a playground for the kiddos. It seems like it's busy most of the time, but the employees sure try their best to crank out orders as fast as possible.  Another plus- the employees actually smile and are friendly!  The restaurant area is clean and thus far all my orders have been correct.  This is probably my favorite McDonald's location.

Let me preface this by saying that I'm usually a Burger King guy (I like their mascot better, McDonald's is too funny looking). ...  ... However, my friend was in town, and I thought, "why the heck not? live a little!" so I brought her here. ...  ... On our way to McDonald's, also known as "Mickey D's" in other areas, I begin to worry that maybe I should have called to reserve a table in advance. ...  ... However, upon arriving, we were pleasantly surprised to find no line!!  ...  ... We did wait a minute or two to be seated, but apparently, this is one of those seat yourself places.   ...  ... As I approached the front, I was immediately mesmerized by their huge selection of burgers. Their menu ranged from McSingles to McDoubles to even McTriples!! They also had a dollar menu consisting of items costing $1.07 after tax.  ...  ... I decided to go with their house special, The Big Mac, and their seasonal Chicken "McNugget" Pieces. ...  ... When I opened up my box of chicken nuggets, the pale-golden/yellow skin indicated that it had just came out of the storage unit next to the fryer.  ...   ... As the freshness evaporated with every bite, I really began to taste all the other kinds of meat that went into making the nuggets. I think I even tasted some pork, but don't take my word for it.  ...  ... Oh my God and then you have the dipping sauces! These little containers held the perfect blend of artificial sweetener and manufactured taste   ...  ... As I eagerly unwrapped my Big Mac, I was slightly disappointed to find that it wasn't as advertised (the picture on the display made it seem a lot bigger!!). Oh well. ...  ... I would really like to commend the chef on making the buns just how I like them, extremely soggy. I was even more impressed that the soggy, limp buns were able to maintain their round form. This is some pretty advanced cooking technique!! ...  ... Anyways, as I bit into my Big Mac, the first thing I tasted was the mayo. Actually, it was the only thing I tasted, but it was some damn good mayo.  ...  ... Finally, if you're watching your waistline, they have a plethora of drink options. Choices like Diet Coke, Diet Coke Zero, Sugar-free Diet Coke Zero, etc... ensures that there's a perfect diet drink for everyone.  ...  ... PS: Perfect date spot for Valentine's Day. Highly recommended!!

REVIEW #2:  2 stars  (802 chars)
I broke down and was craving McDonald's and wanted to check out the newly built one. Ordered the new bacon clubhouse burger. It was tasty but on the cooler side of hot. Once again though fries as bad as you can get. Cold, dried out and down right uneatable. I do like that they have coke zero even as it wasn't mixed properly.  ... Service, what service. No warm welcome or even a smile and it was a manager who was besides himself for having to leave his set position to help me the only customer at noon in line.  ... Dining room looks great new. Dirty as all hell. Looked to sit at 3 high tables and all the seats had greasy soda spots all over them.  ... How hard is it to manage a place like this. I've done it quiet successfully for many years.  ... And yes someone can contact me if they'd like.

Ok, we all know Mcdonalds is good for having to endure horrible attitudes, missing food and more attitudes when you complain. Well the first time I was right as usual lol! The lady who took my order was as rude and just plan ugh as she could be! I had to come back because she left out nearly everything I ordered. So I came back and she was like oh I apologize in such a somber voice and offered 3 dollar menu coupons (Take it they keft out almost 10 dollars worth of food). I took it and gave the manager a call the nest day and she was very apologetic and had me come in. She not only remade my order but asked me anything that I wanted and added it to it. All said and done I left out with almost 50 bucks of free food! So Kudos to them! Thanks!

REVIEW #2:  1 stars  (883 chars)
This is a McDonald's.  The food tastes the same no matter which one you go to, and it's perfectly fine for a late-night fast food fix.  However, this one will never give you the correct food.  Even if employees outnumber patrons three to one, you had better open up every box to make sure you get what you ordered.  Not just look in the bag.  Look in the boxes. ...  ... The employees are friendly enough when you point out their mistakes.  It's not like they're maliciously screwing up your order.  But an order consisting of a Double Quarter-pounder with cheese (yes, that's TWO WHOLE PATTIES, WITH CHEESE), two apple pies and an order of fries should not be difficult to assemble.  You want an Angus burger?  It's a toss-up whether what comes on the burger is even close to what you ordered.   ...  ... I don't want to think about what this place turns into during the lunch rush.

This might be the best run McDonalds in the Madison area. The drive-through runs incredibly fast! Plus, it's a throw back McDonalds with a displayed old milkshake machine that triggered Ray Kroc's involvement in the company, and resulted in him bringing in a franchise model that facilitated the restaurant's world-wide domination. However, who checks for a McDonalds rating?

REVIEW #3:  2 stars  (4494 chars)
I cannot believe I'm reviewing a McDonald's, but I've been to this location three times, and all three visits have been less than stellar.   ...  ... For starters, the "drive thru" system is anything but convenient.  Getting in-and-out via the drive-thru requires you to take 2 full laps around the building - the way the entrance is configured, you must enter their parking lot via the side of the property.  You then drive counter-clockwise around the building to the spot where you order.  Then you drive to get your "food," at which point you're beyond the entrance/exit spot.  So, you have to take another counter-clockwise spin around the parking lot before you can exit. ...  ... It's a terribly inefficient system, and it's somewhat dangerous, as drivers leaving the primary drive-thru lane with their food rarely look for cars circling the building trying to get to the drive-thru.  It's difficult to explain... but go there once, and you'll understand what I'm trying to describe. ...  ... Ok... entrance/egress aside, let's talk about this location.  It's a McDonald's, so the food is going to be exactly the same as you'd find from any other McDonald's in the world (thanks corporate farming/food prep/chemistry!), which means the service makes or breaks the experience. ...  ... Today's experience was especially interesting/frustrating.  I was in Verona, helping a coworker with some home improvement work.  It was around midmorning, and his kids were in the mood for McD's.  Since I was the cleanest of the group, I volunteered to drive and pick-up the grub.  I hopped into the car and made my way over to Mickey Ds, where the drive thru was backed-up (thanks to lack of dual ordering points). ...  ... When I reached the spot to order, I started placing the order.  I don't often go to McDonald's, so I'm not terribly familiar with the protocol... the first item on my list was identified as a "large #3 with Coke."   ...  ... McD's Microphone Dude: "Sir, Sir, Sir - I'm sorry, sir - we don't have a large size breakfast item, we only do that at lunch and dinner, sir." ...  ... Me: "Oh?  So they can't get a large Coke?" ...  ... MDMD: "Sir, I'm sorry, we only have one size for breakfast - we don't have large size breakfasts." ...  ... Me: "Ok?  I only need a large Coke with that #3.  Not trying to Supersize or anything, just adding a large Coke." ...  ... MDMD: "Sir, no - sir, we don't Supersize any longer.  We have large drinks, but we don't Supersize, and we only have one size for breakfast." ...  ... Me: "Let's start over.  Could I have a #3 - the biscuit thing, with a Large Coke?" ...  ... MDMD: (long pause) "Do you want a large Coke?" ...  ... Me: "Yes, and the #3." ...  ... MDMD: (long pause) "So, that's a #3 with large Coke?" ...  ... Me: "Yes." ...  ... MDMD: "Ok." ...  ... Me: (long pause) "Can I continue with the order?"  (looked at screen thing and saw that he got the #3 with large Coke correct) ...  ... MDMD: (long pause) "Yes." ...  ... Me: ...ordered rest of meals for friend and his kids... ...  ... MDMD: Ok, if everything looks correct, proceed to the first window, where we'll have your total ready. ...  ... Me: ...drives around... ...  ... Kid at window: "That'll be $18.14." ...  ... Me: "Sorry for the confusion - I thought you could order a large beverage with your breakfast meal." ...  ... Kid at window: "You can." ...  ... Me: "So, why all of the confusion?" ...  ... Kid: "I don't take the orders here, I just take the money. They take the order at the next window." ...  ... Me: "Oh, ok." ...  ... So, I go to the next window and the kid explains that he thought I wanted a large sized hash browns, and went to great length to explain that they don't have large hash browns, only regular size.  Ok, whatever... ...  ... I returned to my friend's house only to discover they forgot to include the #3 part of the food order... so, we got the large Coke, but no biscuit or hash brown.  UGH!  I gave away my breakfast in the interest of not having to return. ...  ...  ... Previous visits included a bout with cold/hard fries and a botched burger order (asked for onions only; got everything but onions), and a less than enthusiastic balding manager dude who seemed to act as if someone had just stomped on his toes a few seconds before I arrived to his window. ...  ... Thanks to this McDonald's, I'm convinced that I won't need to visit another McDonald's ever again.  I think I'll go watch Supersize Me again, just for good measure.

Haven't eaten BK is a while. ... It's greasier than I remember (i.e. Chicken fries). I tried the tender grill chicken sandwich - it was falling apart, soggy and not at all tasty. ... My hubby's burger wasn't that much better.

Disgusting. Ordered a double whopper which was inedible. I took about 4 bites cause I felt bad wasting it. But then I just had to throw it away cause I couldn't take it anymore. Don't bother visiting this location. Disgusting waste of money. Sad, cause I used to love the whopper.

They have new people with better attitudes. They now have cinnabons, a new interactive playplace for kids of all ages, and a new pop machine similar to the one at Firehouse subs. Keep it up, BK; great positive changes! This location is in the Frys plaza corner of Ray and Dobson in Chandler

Went through the drive through and their service was cordial and professional. The burger was exactly as I order - I just waited a little longer for my food than I expected I would have to wait. No real complaints here though!

**Breakfast Review** ...  ... I got the Bacon, Egg & Cheese Croissan'wich with orange juice for under 5 bucks. The egg is more like the folded scrambled eggs from McDonald's (not the McMuffin) and actually softer. It's your basic breakfast sandwich and the croissant gives it a buttery fluffy texture that was ok. The orange juice comes in a Minute Maid carton which reminded me of elementary school cafeteria days... sigh. I didn't get the hash browns this time. Those are quite commuter friendly as they are served in bit sized portions. ...  ... Still, the location is a bit sleepy, with not many employees at 7am. That's not a bad thing, it just doesn't exude the kind of energy that I'm used to with Sbucks or McD's. The cashier also had a pretty bad cough and didn't look happy. Regardless, if you like Burger King, here ya go! On the NE corner of Dobson/Ray.

REVIEW #5:  3 stars  (742 chars)
As fast food burger places go, this BK location isn't too bad.  ...  ... For a long time BK was a one trick pony, with their Charbroiled Whopper sandwiches. But now,  you see Chicken, Breakfast, 60% healthier fries, Big King, a Big Mac like double burger, and the not too healthy cinnamon buns have all been added. LOL.  ...  ... Still... they are no competition for the Oakbrook, IL folk, but BK is getting their corporate act together. Some might say finally.  ...  ... The employees all seem nice and helpful; while not looking too close at those just expired coupons. LOL I agree with fellow Yelp'ers Andrew and Javier in their assessment and call your attention to their Reviews.  ...  ... So Three and a Half Stars, and A-Ok in my book.

The food was pretty good for BK.  The service was fast and the value menu has decent deals.  However my past two visits had errors though.  Fries rather than onion  rings last time, despite being clear.  I also asked ranch to go with my onion rings this time and they forgot that. ...  ... They'd have gotten 3 or 4 stars if they'd not left stuff out twice in a row.

REVIEW #8:  2 stars  (1880 chars)
We went inside to eat. This location has a play place, and is in the parking lot corner of Ray n Dobson in the Fry's plaza. ...  ... My 8yr old got a kids meal. No crown, even though the gal was making them as we walked in (keep this fact in your head; rest of the story later). The manager, a young guy, had a headphone on and was rude with my dad (my DAD--the poor man is gonna be 70, and he's one of the most patient ppl ever--WTH?). I had to bark at the manager-kid for him to stop his rudeness. I also called him on his odd behavior of asking me if I wanted our drinks to be larger for (xyz cents more)--I said, we're eating in--we get free refills--are you on drive-thru mode or something? That's when he decided to get the chip off his shoulder, at least w/ me. ...  ... My dad's Bk topper was smashed down and looks nothing like the pic...very flimsy.  Don't get that.  Also, when did BK start having sucky, overcooked, fatter fries? They used to have a slim version something like McDonald's only soggier. These newer fries are horrible. ...  ... When my son complained that he got no crown and box w/ his meal, I sent him back up to get one. Again, the boss-man (great leadership and cust svc skills) ignored him when he went back for his crown, then finally said to him that kids don't get a crown anymore (there's the rest of the story on that)!!!  I had to go up and get in his face again! ...  ... We have never had a bad experience there except for that time, which was on a Thursday night about 7pm. We have also never seen many ppl eating inside or kids playing in the play place, for some reason. ...  ... Also, the parking lot is weird. Beware if you are parked there and trying to back out of your space--the drive-thru lane goes very close to the parking spaces and if someone's driving in, you could get into an accident. Not sure why they made it like that.

REVIEW #9:  1 stars  (1173 chars)
First off, I've been eating at the "King" since i was a kid. ... But after my last visit, I don't think that I will ever be back to this place ever again.  ...  ... I had gone through the drive-through, and waited about 15 minutes to get through the line. Now, I understand that there are times when that cannot be avoided, and i shrugged off that anoyance.  ...  ... Not a big deal, but as i was waiting, my attention was grabbed by something crawling on the wall. As i turned to see what it was, i was disgusted by the sight of cockroaches all over the wall! ...  ... My first reaction, was to roll up my window and drive away, but i was hungry and stayed to pick up my meal. Although I should have acted on my first thought. Because, after I got home, there on the seat next to me, were two large roaches. I kind of freaked, got ridd of the intruders, and threw my dinner away.   ...  ... This all gives me serious concerns about the cleanliness of the inside of this establishment. I dont think that I want to risk another visit there again. ...  ... P.S. I found another one in my car the next morning. It gives me the willies just thinking about the whole experience.

REVIEW #10:  1 stars  (805 chars)
I eat at this place all the time when my family is hungry and for something fast.  ... I'm not going back and I don't recommend to anyone. We went there tonight with our kids for there .50 cent cones and play in there new play area. The kids ran into the play room to play while my husband and I went to the counter to order. Barely anyone inside and no one at counter by us. There was only one female in grey uniform who had head phones on came up to counter, my husband said hello and she did not give us the time of day, took a cookie and walked back to kitchen. We stood there for another 10 mins and no one came up to us and said anything! We took our kids out of play area and went to McDonalds down the street. I will never go back and I hope they fire the lady due to her poor customer service!!!!

REVIEW #11:  1 stars  (1786 chars)
This place can be summed up in one word: DISGUSTING. I have been to Burger King before, so this review is NOT about the quality of the food. I have eaten at this restaurant before via drive-thru, but this was my first visit where I ate-in. I wish I hadn't. With the scorching summer temperatures and two very bored kids, I figured we'd hit a place with an indoor playground so they could burn off some energy.  ...  ... Walking in the door, there was an odd smell. It should have been my first sign to turn around and leave. But with two small kids gunning for the playground, there was no way I could drag them back out without eating or playing without a screaming fit. So I pushed on, ordered food and paid. The service was friendly enough.  ...  ... The buttons on the drink machine were sticky. Gross. Sign #2 that I should grab my kids and run. The indoor playground had only four tables in a wide open room, with two of them taken and one filthy, I opted for the only table available. The chair was sticky as we sat down. Already, before eating, my stomach churned at the thought of the impending food poisoning.  ...  ... Everything was filthy at this location. I regret not grabbing my kids kicking and screaming and dragging them from the restaurant. ...  ... But it wasn't until I noticed the large rat house-style trap on the side of the building that I realized what I'd just subjected my family to.  ...  ... Needless to say I will not be returning. The kids got a head-to-toe sanitizer bath in the car and a full bath as soon as we got home, in hopes of killing some of the germs that are no doubt crawling on every inch of their skin as a result of playing in the playground.  ...  ... I would rather brave the 115 degree playground than return to this restaurant! YUCK!

I don't go to BK that much,  but I've never had an issue with the service at this location.  No one has ever forgotten my food at the drive thru,  and all the employees seem competent and nice enough.    ...  ... On this trip,  I didn't order my usual Whopper with cheese,  I decided to branch out and try the Big King.   I know it's BK's attempt to copy the Big Mac,  but eating it just left me wanting a Big Mac.   Oh,  I'm sure if you had never tried a Big Mac before,  it would probably taste perfectly fine, it was a decent fast food  burger.   But for someone like me who loved them as a kid,  it just wasn't the same.   Next time,  I'm sticking with the Whopper with cheese... Then I won't leave disappointed.

REVIEW #2:  2 stars  (688 chars)
I go to this location often on the way to work, and the past six times I've ordered a double cheeseburger with bacon added... Lately they'll correct me, "YOU MEAN A BACON DOUBLE CHEESEBURGER???" Kind of meanly, So I say yes obviously because I guess that's a value menu item now. Six out of six times it has come with no bacon, while I'm still being charged for it. Most of those times they also give me no receipt, so I can't even go back after work. It may not seem like much to most people but seriously it wasn't a one time mistake, they're going to continue to misread their screens since they added that to the value menu instead of the old "cheeseburger + bacon." Kinda irritating.

REVIEW #1:  4 stars  (1224 chars)
By far, I prefer this fast food restaurant over all others! I've been coming here for about three years and have only had a few issues with service. The staff is friendly, the food is usually good, and the restaurant is fairly quiet throughout the day. Aside for the few times where food has taken longer than expected to be made (or a wrong order given to us), my family has had good times at this place.  ...  ... My sole complaint (aside from the general issues with food service that arise every now and again)  is that the counter help sometimes bring your trays of food to your table. This is a nice plus in the fast food industry, but it irritates me when I have to walk to get my food and then proceed to watch as the people next to us have their food brought to them despite there being no issues regarding age or disability. It is completely disrespectful and rude when this occurs. It implies that there is a level of class that you do not have and that others do. I would recommend that all food is brought to the customers or that no food is brought out. I understand that I dress extremely casual for a person with a law degree, but providing that added service to a person based upon appearance is ridiculous.

I can't complain about the food because that was just a burger and fries for me. It's just that the service here always sucked and it sucked once more. The drive thru is always slow and the service is not good either. If you go and hit the drive thru just expect a very long wait as that is their norm. If you do happen to go and it happens fast.. Thank your lucky stars and move on

The building is very new and the staff is friendly. I go there at least 3 times a week because they are on my way home from work. The food has been consistent so far and the drunk machine is a awesome custom mixing coke machine that let's you customize every drink. The wait times can be long at times so a faster drive thru would be nice but, I'd say overall it's one of the top burger kings I've visited for fast food.

REVIEW #2:  3 stars  (614 chars)
Ate inside for the first time in a long while. Usually, it's To Go.  ...  ... Ordered the Whopper combo, no upsizing. The cashier was friendly, paid him and he noticed I had a coin, which looked like a quarter, but was from United Arab Republic. He asked if I had another coin, I didn't so I was going to take my change back and give him a dollar. But he said 'Don't worry about it and took the coins. ...  ... The Whopper was hot off the grill and so was the french fries. I wish the fries were a bit thinner like In & Out's. But, I have to remember we are at Burger King. My meal was satisfying and I'll be back.

REVIEW #3:  2 stars  (508 chars)
We just arrived in Fountain Hills, after a long days drive of 11 hours.  Naturally, we were starving, and needed something quick and filling to eat.  This Burger King is very dumpy, and looks like it needs an upgrade.  The guy who waited on me was very sullen, and didn't seem to care that customers pay his salary and keep the economy moving.  He just pushed the bag of food at me, and grunted "here you go" like I was a horse, or dog.  Anyways, at least the food was hot, otherwise, they would lose a star.

I usually would think one Burger King is the same as the next but....wow....this place was terrible! I got a coupon in the mail and saw they have a new chicken parm sandwich and I was in a hurry so I decided what the hell. After I ordered and I got to the window, the woman at the window didn't even acknowledge me. After a few minutes, she told me my total, I paid, she gave me my food and closed the window. Never heard another word after my total. That should have been an indication of what my food was going to be like. When I pulled up to the end of the drive thru, I opened my bag, unwrapped my sandwich and thought the bread was a bit cold. I took a bite into my sandwich only to find that bun was slightly frozen, the marinara sauce cold, the cheese frozen and the chicken lukewarm at best!  I put the car in reverse, went to the window and waited. The same woman opened the window, didn't say anything to me so I told her about the sandwich. I explained that the sandwich was cold and the cheese was frozen. Her reply?  Well after what seemed like an eternity of silence, her reply was "no it's not. The cheese is cold though". I said "noooo...the sandwich is cold and the bun is a bit frozen still". After snatching the sandwich out of my hand, she closed the window. A couple minutes later a guy handed me a bag with a new sandwich. Again, no words. Just window opened and then closed. I was afraid to open the bag but I was brave. This time the chicken was hot and everything was cold.  I couldn't even eat it. I just ended up throwing it away. They have lost my business.

REVIEW #6:  1 stars  (670 chars)
WORST Burger King EVER!!! ... I thought like the previous reviewer that all Burger Kings are alike. For some reason this is not the case and the burger king in fountain hills is only consistent for SUCKING and SCREWING UP YOUR ORDER and never bringing it to you when they tell you to wait outside. I have had the misfortune to eat at this one over the past few years and it sucks even more now that they did this big fancy remodel than before. Here is a tip: Dont waste a bunch of money on some expensive remodel and then expect to stay in business giving people crappy COLD and OLD fries that they have to wait 15 minutes for. This place sucks. Never going there again.

REVIEW #2:  1 stars  (985 chars)
In our opinion, you should avoid this fast food stop at all costs! Horrible service!  Our hamburger with mustard and pickles only had to be remade twice. How hard is it to take an order and make it as requested, not once, but twice! ...  ... That's not all, we requested Apple Fries and got an Apple Pie, I can understand the mistake, but when the manager and assistant manager don't care enough about customer service, both saw our issue with the burger remakes, and didn't make an effort to take care of us.   ...  ... If this wasn't enough, we were over charged for the Apple Pie and come to find out we were charged for a cheese-burger.  I know, I know, not a ton of cash, but it was my cash and with the absolute disregard for customer service, the Burger King in Gila Bend Arizona ranks among the top 10 worst experiences in our many fast food stops. ...  ... Stay away, enjoy the Mickey D's down the road, anything but stop here! It deserves less than a star on multiple levels.

Let's see, why not stop at the Burger King in the middle of nowhere? ...  ... * Service ... * Flies ... * Dirtiness ...  ... Wow. I wish we had stopped at McDonalds or just about anywhere else instead. When we walked in the dining room was staffed by what appeared to be the entire family of one of the employees. Kids, husband, grandparents, cousins. And they were all hanging out by the soda machine, blocking the only access to the front counter. But even if the family were there every time, the three reasons listed above would definitely keep me from visiting again. ...  ... Seriously, there are like two other restaurants within a few blocks. They really couldn't be any worse.

I agree with the other review. SKIP this one and go to the one just up the road on Val Vista & Warner. ... I have visited this one twice. I should have learned my lesson when I got cold food the first time I went here. I tried it again figuring maybe they just had a bad day as we all have them .. NOPE! The food was just as crummy as it was the first time.. but this time it was burnt. If I hadn't ordered it via drive thru, I would have sent it back. My whole order was not acceptable & was thrown right into the rubbish, except the soda. $7 wasted. BOO. Don't waste your seven bucks here!!!

Today was an unimpressive day for BK. I was really feeling a whopper. Waited all day, starved myself until the timing/location was right. I've stopped at this location before for a mocha frappe and have always got good service & exactly what I wanted. Today however, it was a different story. Follow me back in time (bout an hour) with an empty stomach and hungry eyes........ ...  ... Older gentleman at the counter greeted me and put the decision immediately in my hands with a friendly "what can I get for you?" Without skipping a beat, Double whopper with queso, hold the cat sauce (AKA ketchup) & dab a little extra mayo on that masterpiece. Since I'm starved but not willing to give up quality for quantity go ahead and enlarge my meal and replace those boring 1945 fries for some SATISFRIES wouldja! "What to drink sir?" Nothing made me happier than letting Mocha Frappe roll of the tip of my tongue & nothing blanketed my party like a snappy comeback from this older gentleman about the mix not being ready. Devastation! But, not all is lost. I attempted to trick my tastebuds into happiness by ordering the mocha iced coffee and I tried to keep my spirits high by remembering the very reason I stopped in here today. My infatuation for a whopper!  ...  ... Well, about 10 minutes later (think they forgot about me, no honestly!) my meal was ready. I proudly marched back to the only clean table I could find and opened the white box of happiness to find a single patty of beef. Alone in a sea of salad. Tried a couple fries on the way up to the counter, and they were cold. The drive thru operator was quick to get the problem for me. That older gentleman quickly moved on scene to see what was shaking. I love older people because they have no filter. Quietly to the burger prepper guy he asks him "what the hell is wrong with you?" Now I'm not the the guy who's gonna complain about a little ass chew'n, especially since I come from a military background. Thats just an everyday thing in my book when you fall short at a simple task. Why do I bring it up then you say, because it was hilarious to hear this older gentlemen in action! I've got mad respect for this guy now and I'm certain if I get out of line he'll call 2 big guys from the back to help adjust my attitude, hahaha! ...  ... A couple minutes go by & the older gentleman brings out round 2. I duck, I weave and I cautiously open the little white box and POW! A double whopper with cheese, hold the ketchup & add sum mayo. Finally, I've gotten what I've been waiting for all day. Was it a home run, no more like an intentional walk but hey it's what I wanted so I dug in. Those satisfies on round 2-still cold. Well, I wasn't gonna cry wolf twice because the first time went so well. so I chalked it up as a loss. Iced coffee was pretty good tho.... tasted like chocolate milk-YUM! Just getting ready to leave and that older gentleman graced us with his presence from the shadows and offered us 2 complimentary breakfast sammiches for the inconvenience. A nice gesture for an unsatisfying meal.  ...  ... Now that you & I have taken a trip down memory lane I leave you with this little JM fortune cookie. Never trust meal to be what you want when reviews from YELP say you better choose another idea......

If there was a way to give zero stars, I would.  My family walked in the door at 4:50, and my son had to use the restroom, so my husband went to grab a high chair and table with my other son.  When he finished (is is 5 and takes forever), we walked straight to the counter to order for their "happy hour".  The lady said it was over, rudely.  I looked at my phone, it was 5:01!  Seriously?  She saw me walk in and use the restroom, and at the very least she saw husband waiting for me.  We were the ONLY people in there!  We ordered nothing an left.

Time to start sounding like a commercial! ... The Angry Whopper has: ... Sandwich is 14 lb of savory fire-grilled beef, topped with thick-cut smoked bacon, melted Pepper Jack Cheese, freshly cut iceberg lettuce, spicy onion petals, ripe tomatoes, spicy jalapenos, and smothered with a spicy angry sauce, all on a warm, toasted, sesame seed bun. ... Pretty Crazy! And you know what? It was good, liked it very much. Would I have it again? Probably not, only because I am afraid to look up the calories and fat on this beast!  ... But seriously, I try to stay away from fast food. But they are always there when you need them.  ...  ... Note# Since the seven year old did not order on the kids menu, the manager was still nice enough to give her a toy with the meal. Very nice of him.

But they are improving and the rodeo burger is back. Even with that though it is still the worst fast food around.

Kudos to this location for pulling of a great fundraising event for my sons elementary school. I only attended this location because my son's school used them for a fundraiser. 10% of the sales were being donated to an elementary school. I opted to park and dine in because it has an indoor play ground. The parking lot is pretty small. They share a lot with a plaza which has at least 2-3 more stores. The drive through access is a little awkward, but what fast food place isn't now-a-days.  ...  ... Anyway, upon entering I initially thought long line, long wait. Well, they had workers stationed all throughout the restaurant to offer assistance which was very helpful. I was able to find a table for my family and the manager made sure to bring my food which is not usual for a fast food place. I was impressed. There was not much moving space in the dining area. I am not sure if they added more tables because of the event or not. There was staff always visible cleaning and assisting the guests which was great. The food quality was good. They got my order correct and it was still hot when I was eating it.

This is a Burger King that you will not find on the Burger King web site. No idea why since it has been here for maybe a year.  ...  ... Well anyway I was driving back from a listing and for some reason pulled in here, I am not one to patronize Burger King, but I did. ...  ... I ordered the Steak House Burger combo. They were very quick in getting this out the drive through window. Oh and yes the window person was polite. ...  ... The burger is an odd looking thing, very flat and wide, larger than the bun oh and also quite thin. It is piled high with fried onions, lettus, tomato, sauce and cheese. It has a decent taste but for some reason it felt as if I were eating a mutant burger. The fries were fine I guess. I am not much for fries so not an expert.  For me this burger is too much food, a good one to share. Hmm why do I order a combo if do not like fries, I will have to remember not too next time.

This location needs a little help. The drive through light was not on. Maybe it was broken but it appeared close at 7pm at night. There was a delay in anyone to take my order which was disappointing because when I pulled through the drive through no customers were placing orders inside or in the drive through. My food was cold including my frozen in the middle apple pie which I did have to drive back to the Resturant to have them fix it. The manager was nice and fixed my order right away.

I've had many problems with the service at this location.  The employees are nice but they regularly mess up my order and the bun's on the hamburgers are always soggy.

THEY DON'T WEAR GLOVES. ...  ... I watched a lanky kid behind the counter scratch his face then shove some stray fries into their container with the same bare face-scratching hands.  I was mildly grossed out.  Then I realized the fries belonged to me.  Now we're beyond mild. ...  ... This is ready-to-eat food.  Being exposed to all the face-scratching, sneezing, money-handling, and other random contaminants out there.   I wanted salt, not Hepatitis A seasoning my fries ...  ... So I did the unthinkable.  I brought it up.  And when I did, I was told glove-wearing is a manager's choice.  Well, going there is a customer's choice, so I'll definitely be finding my dinner elsewhere.  Disgusting.

Nothing but positive for this bk. It is fast food so I can't give it a 5, but I usually typically come late at night. They haven't messed my order up once surprisingly in 5+years.  ...  ... Sometimes the order might take awhile but it's to make it fresh. I love the new big Mac knock off, but my favorite is the crispy chicken salad with Ranch then asking for Buffalo sauce

When we got home and opened the bag the size of the BIG KING sandwich's were so small we started laughing.  ...  ... I ordered a large fries and got less than half of what I expected. TOTAL RIP OFF!!! ...  ... How do you get rid of 40% fat and 30% calories? CUT THE SERVING SIZE IN HALF!!!

REVIEW #3:  1 stars  (766 chars)
Only come here if you have time to kill. I've been here three times...and twice I finally walked out (along with a few other people who gave up as well). They're extremely slow and don't really care how long it takes them to get around to your order. It isn't an issue with the number of employees, either, because there's usually five to six employees hanging around waiting for someone else to do their job. While I was watching the (very slow) guy in the back putting the burgers together, the woman up front was staring into space. Apparently, there's some Burger King law that says you have to wait until you have the hamburger on the tray before you can scoop out the fries and onion rings. Absolutely ridiculous. I get faster service at a sit-down restaurant.

REVIEW #4:  1 stars  (372 chars)
this place is a mess.  people were yelling in the kitchen and not cooking food. the drive thru was backed up with no food going out.  I asked where the manager was and was told she was in the back yelling and not working along with the rest of the help . the only one working was Haley.  I asked her what her name was. the garage cans were overflowing and it wasn't clean.

As far as my expectations for a fast food burger place go, this location isn't that bad. I needed a place to let the kids let out some energy so the playground was it. ...  ... I was pretty happy with the cleanliness of the playground and there is a hand sanitizer dispenser right by the playground door. This, I appreciate. ...  ... It's a burger king, so really if it isn't a filthy mess it's pretty difficult to call it a disappointment unless something is really wrong. They got my order right (ordering for myself and 4 kids so it wasn't a simple one). ...  ... I am curious though when burger king's prices began to creep up. Their marketing and decor seems to be trying to send me a message that they're a casual restaurant now instead of fast food. I appreciate the effort to elevate their image, but the food doesn't reflect that yet so let's put the whopper somewhere further below 4 bucks again, please? (I remember when they were a buck.) ...  ... But, yeah, I can imagine that most fast food places only get reviewed when a customer is upset. I don't think this location deserves such a bad rap.

If I could give Burger King no stars I would. I used to love BK but they are skimping so bad now on the quality of there food it tastes like complete crap. I used to stop here on the way home from work and have a double whopper and frys. I really looked forward to it but not anymore. There food went from juicy and good to dried out garbage. I kept going thinking maybe it was just a fluke but it wasnt. It never got back to being what it used to be. Its just disgusting. The flavor has changed, the texture has changed, everything else good has changed. I am done with BK for good. Jack in the Box is always good and you they have a great selection of food. I think I will stick to Jacks from now on.

OMG!!  I went in to this Burger King thinking I was going to enjoy a quick bite.  Instead, I was ripped off.  I had chosen my meal from the menu and ordered it.  Silly me I thought the price on the menu board was the price I would be charged.  No!  Apparently you need to specify what size meal you want or the employees of this place are instructed to automatically charge you for the biggest size they offer!! outrageous!!!!  Stay away from any and all Burger King's, especially this one!!!

I was going to log on and give them a good review. Order of 6 items was taken promptly and each of the bags handed to me at the DT Window had their contents inspected and read to me in a polite, efficient manner. Fries poking out of the bag were hot and fresh.  ... The Problem arose when I got home and unpacked 3 burgers, 1 fish and 1 fry. Again with the Drive-thru Curse. Why is it so hard for fast-food employees to count items and put them in a bag? I'm not spending two bucks in gas to go back for fries that cost them 15cents to make (including their labor and overhead).

If I could give no stars I would. I paid $5.34 for a burger that was so cold I would be skeptical to believe a rumor that it was ever warm. I brought it back, got my money back from a manager that didn't seem remotely abashed, as if it was normal routine at this Burger King on Bell Rd and 7th St.

My hubby was hungry after having a few drinks so we went out looking for something to eat. Everything was closed since it was past 11pm, except for fast food, so that was pretty much our only option. Hubby insisted on going to Burger King & got himself the chicken nuggets meal & for me the chicken fries meal. He was pretty tipsy so he downed his whole meal, but I was sober as can be & could only stomach about half. The fries were barely warm & way too crunchy. The chicken fries were so thick w/coating & just overall disgusting. The sweet & sour sauce I got w/them didn't help either, way too sugary sweet. Needless to say, if my hubby insists on coming here again out of drunkenness I am not ordering anything!

I will say that I overall DETEST burger kings as I feel their burgers are filth and the rest of their food is too.  Then came the deep fried cheese ball.  I saw an image for Cheesy Tots and though that sounded amazing after a day of near starvation. I pull up, and a LOVELY guy named Jim came to the window.  We schmoozed and he told me about the Cheesy Tots and that they're made to order and never frozen (nice) and because they were made to order, "IF I WANT TO EAT THEM IN THE CAR, I SHOULD WAIT A BIT FOR THEM TO COOL SO I DON'T BURN MYSELF".... THANK YOU!!!!! I was so prepared to drive off and pop one in my mouth only to feel the volcano of heat within my mouth which could have caused me to do something REALLY stupid on the road.  Because he truly wanted to make sure that I did not hurt myself, or others, he took two seconds to tell me that and I greatly appreciate it.  If he's a window guy, he should be a manager... If he's already a manager, he should be a regional manager... and so on.  Jim, singlehandedly took someone who hadn't eaten Burger King in 10+ years to someone who is willing to try it out more so now.  Thanks a ton Jim! You earned it.

Armed with a $1.99 coupon, I stopped in here a couple of days ago to try the "Big King" burger.  What a disappointment!  It had 2 little meat patties about the size of silver dollars.  Yes the taste was ok, but if I'd paid the regular price of $3.79 (!!) for it, this would be a 1-Star Review! ...  ... As for the restaurant itself, everything was fine.  It has a comfortable dining room and the service was good.  Corporate just needs to double the size of each meat pattie (without raising the price) if they're going to call this burger "Big King"!     :-O

Burger King is Burger King...this place is always clean, which is a good thing. I just wish they had their coke and tea available to customers.  ...  ...

Maybe some of my surprise came from not having been to any new Burger Kings of late, but I was really surprised when my husband and I went in to this location yesterday morning (we had a craving for fast food breakfast) and saw that it was all decked out in a Hollywood theme. It had sleek colored booths, framed pictures of movie stars, and get this - pendant lighting! Granted, pendant lighting has become as ubiquitous in restaurants as jukeboxes used to be, but it's still strange that fast food franchises have even jumped on the decor bandwagon. Anyway, the people working at this location are super-friendly, although the staff does tend to be more motivated when a location is relatively new (this one is about a year old), and the food we got was to be expected. I do love BK's French Toast Sticks for a nutrition-less but delicious Saturday morning breakfast, and my husband's sausage muffin was good (although he ordered it with egg and cheese and didn't get them). To sum it up, this is a good location as far as Burger Kings go, but in the end, it's just Burger King, which is never really all that great.

The Big King is BK's 'Big Mac'. It is made exactly like the Big Mac. Even down to the special sauce. I tasted the meat more-so than anything.  ... The chicken nuggets were crispy fresh and good. Fries, as well.  ... I really love the Coke fountain they have here. You can add multiple flavors to your soda at no extra charge. ... Over all, I give this Burger King a 5/5.

Dear Burger King Manager at 2318 W Northern Ave: My fianc is too kind to write this, but I am not. Yesterday (October 9th, 2013) a few Special Needs Adults came into your Fine Dining Establishment, supervised by my fianc and his coworker. While it's true, one of these Special Needs Adults does have an issue with body odor, I expect he isn't the first to enter your Fine Dining Establishment with such a problem. They do landscaping work during the day in Phoenix, and don't have time to run home for a shower before sitting down for a burger and fries at your Fine Dining Establishment. I am curious to know if you also ask fully functioning construction workers, surveyors, ranch workers, etc. to leave when faced with the same issue, or if it was simply because these were adults with disabilities? Or perhaps it was because the gentleman in question was African American? I'd like to think you're just an ignorant fuck, but maybe you are a racist ignorant fuck too.  - Liz Petty

this is by far the worst burger king i have ever been to. the first mistake was when i ordered the brownie icecream and the girl who made it gave it to me burnt. when asked did she know the brownies were burned she said yes and gave them to us to eat anyways. then when i go to the drive thru to make two seperate orders i was told only one order per vehicle allowed. i was like since when is this and why is that. the employees are so lazy and half assed they never do anything right. i would say if you are hungry and need a quick bite to eat do not come here what so ever. it should be closed down and they need to do a massive rehire.

Driving down central about to head to another lunch location when the driver starts talking about Burger King and whoppers, so you know we had to find the nearest Bk. The taste of the whopper is so good and unique. Plus I haven't had one in a while.  ...  ... Upon arriving to this location, it is not busy at all, and the parking lot is empty but that doesn't stop our Whopper journey. It is a dated Bk but playing some good tunage! ...  ... The man who took our order was very nice and seemed happy to have a customer ... We both got whoppers and I actually opted for the double whopper, don't judge me, haha ...  ... I didn't know that they got the new Coca Cola machines. I think they're like "free style" super cool and so many flavors. I was happy to see Cherry Coke.  ...  ... Since the Bk isn't busy our good was made from scratch which is kinda neat ... The whopper is nice, fresh, and hot  ... Totally good ... The fries are super fresh which is very uncommon at any fast food joint :) ...  ... This was such a good last second choice and a total money saver :)

I don't want to waste too much time on this place, but since I mentioned it in another review I feel obligated to say a few words. ...  ... This is the worst Burger King in the world so far, and I have been to some bad ones. Everything manages to have a bitter taste that I just cannot explain. I seem to remember a time when BK did not nuke every single thing, but those days are a fading memory. Bitter taste plus microwaved texture equals food that hogs would turn up a nose at. Still the place is usually crowded.  ...  ... The one redeeming quality is the staff. I've worked a block away for two and a half years and a lot of the crew have worked there that whole time. They're pretty friendly considering what they get paid. Still, the food is just so terrible I cannot bring myself to give it even two stars.

REVIEW #7:  1 stars  (1680 chars)
I've tried really hard to like this location since it is close to work, but everything about it is just no. ...  ... First off, it's BK so the quality of food is not great anyway, but this location tends to be more on the weak side. ...  ... Secondly, the staff consistently make errors on orders, wasting food and customers' time when they have to remake something. What's worse is they're usually rude about it. It's like hey you didn't type it into the register correctly, that's not really my fault. They will argue with you and make sure you know you can't have it your way, no matter what their slogan is. ...  ... Lastly, they don't honor coupons the correct way. I just went there with a buy-one-get-one-free coupon that blatantly says I would get a free Whopper sandwich of equal or lesser value with the purchase of one. NOWHERE does it say that it excludes special Whoppers like the Angry Whopper, etc. So when I asked if I could get an Angry Whopper and the free one be a regular Whopper, the Hispanic, older (maybe 40s) woman with long, painted nails (describing her so you know to stay away from her - she is referred to as the "Latina hussie" in the other post) asked me passive aggressively if I wanted an Angry Whopper and two regular Whoppers. ...  ... No, that is EXACTLY why I was asking if I could get that deal because other BKs actually honor the coupon and its ambiguity. I said the coupon didn't specify but she handed me the coupon, roller her eyes like she had something better to do, and said it only applied to REGULAR Whoppers. Okay, so never going back to your sh*thole because other BKs actually take the coupon and apply it to any Whopper, thanks.

You know, it's been years since I ate at Burger KIng. I loved this place when I was younger and I can say it certainly contributed to me being as big as a house. I loved their sausage croissants and whoppers, but as I grew older, the whoppers became smaller and of course, more expensive. I think the last time I ate at BK was in Madrid in 2003. ...  ... Anyway, with coupon in hand I sent the boy to pick up something to nosh on for lunch. I was incited however not by having a 2 for 1 coupon but on the new fries featured in their new commercial. Glad I did. The fries were great They are thicker which I love,  they were hot , maybe a little too much salt. That's it.  ...  ... The Whopper was delicious and brought me back to my high school days in Passaic NJ where I could put down two of those bad boys. It was hot, fresh and a perfect blend of mayo, mustard and ketchup. As a double whopper is could have been wonderful, but the single was satisfying.  ...  ... I guess I I have come full circle. I'll be back Mr. Burger King.

REVIEW #3:  3 stars  (272 chars)
The newley remodeled BK looks great, they lost the stuck in 1998 look. The negatives are the slow customer service, the stupid drink machine ( please bring back the fountains), and the fact that they no longer have cinni-minnis and have replaced them with cinni-bon rolls.

The helpful female behind the counter casually taking my double whopper meal order just a few mins before closing with a  friendly smile on her face was enough to forget your in a sketchy area late at night. I very much enjoy my endless options at the soda machine and the clean tables in the dining area.

REVIEW #2:  3 stars  (618 chars)
Not a bad place. Service is good with friendly employees. The food, although not the beat does taste good and is fresh.  While there I had the angry whopper. Im not a fan of thick french fries, but theirs was still good.  ...  ... What I liked most was their choices of soda. They have "orange coke" flavored soda. I never even heard of it before, so I had to try and and wow. Was it good.   ...  ... Sadly the whole time I was thinking there they never swept the floor that needed it. Yeah its a small thing and I am not going to eat off it, but visually it is not appealing. The same is true of their bathroom floor.

REVIEW #3:  3 stars  (304 chars)
Pros: consistent food. New and clean. Nothing tastes like the Whopper. Onion ring sauce.  ...  ... Cons: waited in the drive thru for 15 minutes at 530pm. Way too early for dinner time crowds, right? Not fast food! Why can't I stay away from Burger Kings? I always give them negative reviews for service.

REVIEW #3:  2 stars  (705 chars)
It seems fast foods places get my order wrong more than they get it right. After being told they were out of onion rings and tarter sauce, they offered to substitute of mayo for tarter; I said no thank you. The receipt stated that request correctly. But the manager filled the order incorrectly not once but twice. First time I received a chicken sandwich instead of the fish I ordered. Second time I got the fish, which was good so I'll bump from 1 to 2 stars for that, but it had mayo on it. I choose BK for their onion rings which they failed to provide. Heads up Airport BK, failure to provide all menu items regularly is a violation of your franchise agreement so don't be surprised when you lose it.

Whiplash Whopper is a Whopper with extra onions. ...  ... I discovered the Iron Man 2 hype by ordering a Whiplash Whopper because I wanted the bold flavor.  It was extra onions.  I paid an extra 80 or so cents for something I could have had free if I ordered the Whopper.  Anyhow, I finished the burger in front of my gate seconds before boarding.  ...  ... On a plus, the manager noticed the wave of hungry people and went down the line and took the customer's orders.

REVIEW #3:  3 stars  (397 chars)
I know it has been awhile since I patroned one, but I couldn't believe how expensive this BK was. We ordered two of the cheaper meals, no frills, and it was over $15. ...  ... Aside from the price, it took forever for someone to take our order even though we were the only customers in line. ...  ... The food came fairly fast and it was decent, but the prices alone will keep me from coming back.

REVIEW #4:  2 stars  (370 chars)
The reason they are so expensive is because this location is a franchise. It's always been on the high side in terms of prices. Food is kind of on the average ground, and while convenient for a location, they should realize their high prices won't help them whatsoever. ... Haven't gone to this location in years, but I'm not surprised they haven't lowered their prices.

I received a coupon in the mail at my home & this location was the closest.  Interestingly enough they wouldn't accept the coupon, said they don't honor coupons...bad customer service I would say. Giving this location 1 star only because Yelp required it to post my review.

REVIEW #6:  1 stars  (490 chars)
Slowest.service.ever... It doesn't matter if you're ordering one item or twenty it will take you at least 15 min to get thru when there is no one else in line! They have over 4 employees working, no customers and yet it takes forever to place your order and GET your food. They always apologize about the wait and yet do nothing to fix it. To top it you see them moving at a snails pace and don't acknowledge you just stand there... Ugh! So frustrating! Avoid this place as much as possible

Two times now I've been to this location and they were not participating in advertised specials, and frankly I am just tired of it. ...  ... It would be nice if the corporate franchise would make franchisees post clearly if they are not participating in wide-range advertisements, but I've learned my lesson about this location. I won't be stuck in their drive through trying to get dinner for my kids again. ...  ... I recommend any of the other locations in the area, I have never had this kind of difficulty anywhere else.

WARNING!!!! DO NOT GO THROUGH THE DRIVE THROUGH.  Went there last Saturday and waited 20 minutes in line at the drive through.  Thought it was an isolated incident so went back Sunday afternoon, waited 15 minutes.  When I finally got to the window I saw a manager wearing a white button down shirt and black jeans wearing glasses, I told him my complaint and he mumbled something and turned away.  Never any apologies and what's worst no one seemed to care.  I will never go there!

I usually dislike burger king but when you are desperate and do not want to spend 25 bucks at a more expensive place in the airport this seems like a best bet. The burgers were not dry... the fries were fresh out of the fryer and crispy outside soft inside... boyfriend left and came back within 10 minutes... no gurgling upset stomach during the flight.. I guess we lucked out.

REVIEW #5:  3 stars  (580 chars)
Unfortunately, you don't go to an airport and expect to get a 5 star meal.  It's where you buy food when you have no other options or need to get something quick.  If you've already past thru security then your options are limited.  This is the same greasy junk that you would get at any other Burger King- don't expect so much as a smile from the employees.  Sticky floors, messy counters, but you get what you would expect. ...  ... If you've got some extra time- head to Paradise Bakery in the main area of the airport- outside of the security lines.  Much better quality food.

I guess they don't make very many veggie burgers here. The lady looked at me crazy when I asked for one. I should have taken that as a hint. Worst burger ever. It tasted like dry hard cardboard. It tasted like they got a freezer burned patty and over microwaved it.  Don't do it guys go to the cpk next door. On the upside the French fries were pretty good but the burgers will make u sick.

Microwaved Meals! ...  ... So i ended up at this terminal during a morning flight and was starving. Found the burgerking and was ready to have a biscuit, egg, sausage muffin with hash and orange juice. This BK was strange in that you picked up your selected sandwich through a window-ish thing on the counter.  ...  ... This particular visit revealed: ...  ... 1) No Biscuits!! Everything is in a croissant... sadface ... 2) Nothing was hot and ready ... 3) Burger King employee was putting things in the microwave, heating them up, and then sliding the sandwiches through the window. Gross. ... 4) Hash browns were a greasy, NOT CRISPY, mess! ... 5) Orange juice couldnt be messed up (it came out a tropicana mini box) ... 5) Service - Terrible!  ...  ... And how much did I spend to have this experience $8!... Yes, I got ripped a new one at the airport yet again!

REVIEW #11:  1 stars  (860 chars)
No flame-broiled "have it your way" goodness here.  The burgers are microwaved, the fries are right next to the line of customers waiting to order. Nothing to stop greasy kids from reaching in and touching them, or from Suzie Sicky from sneezing all over them.  ...  ... I had a late landing here and wanted to grab something to eat before heading to my hotel. Burger King was one of the few options available (if not the only one).  The cashier was filthy (hands/shirt), and could barely understand my order. He got it wrong and proceeded to argue with me until I said I wasn't paying $4.00 for a plain cheeseburger (it was $2.50). Finally, he called his supervisor who sorted it out (he thought I had ordered a double).  Ugh. Frustration after a flight is the last thing you need.  ...  ... Skip this place.  It would be better to go hungry than to eat here.

I was looking around for a fast place to get a bit to eat so I saw burger king... Plus I had a coupon for 2 whoopers and 2 small fries for $4.99 so I decided to give it a try. I enter to find no one at the counter I stood there for about 5 minutes before anyone came to wait on me... Someone finally came to the front and said how can I help you? I handed her the coupon and said I will have this... Ok cheese is extra I said that's fine that will be $14.27 I was like what that must be some expensive cheese. She says opps forgot to use the coupon I will give you cash back I said cool... So now I have to wait till she trys to figure out how much money to give me back with a super puzzled look she hands me back 1 dollar and 5 dimes... That his point I think I am in another world lol... I said you charged me $14.27 she says oh yeah at this point I am watching mind shut down the manager comes over at this point and try's to fix it I had keep the $1.50 on the counter I slid it back and said you take this money back and just redo it. So after all that she hands me back $7.10 I not even sure if that right lol... Plus there was a random hamburger in my bag looks like another fun Burger King adventure... I will not be back anytime soon or maybe I will your now entering the "Burger Zone" where people are over charged and random burgers appear in your bag.

You can not simply go through life calling yourself "King" when you have not earned it. If you do, the populous will start to resent you. Just look at Lebron James, a king with no kingdom. A dog that has a bigger bark than bite. Well let me tell you then, I believe we should rename burger king to burger kingdom because they rule mother earth from the core to the troposphere. Deserving their name for their disturbingly great values, sometimes I ponder what African tribe has been exploited to bring me prices so low? Quickly the thought is stricken from my mind after I take my first bite into my triple stacker. Clearly this burger gained it's recipe from the highest authority. When Gabriel came down to earth to tell Mary she was pregnant, it is my suspicion he dropped the secrets to this heavenly concoction. Admirably I believe they perhaps are responsible for a portion of heart disease in this country. Not the kind that causes health problems, the kind that makes you nostalgic. The kind that makes you wish you were 8 again eating free burgers and frys with your dad and the world was in equilibrium. You had naught a care in the world. Just eating your burger in peace, you sat there with your imagination streaming faster than an X Wing. Who brought you this experience? You guessed it. Perhaps we could promote peace in Iraq by dropping them free burgers from the king? Everyone always asked the cliched question... Why do they hate us? Have you not realized it yet fool! It is because we are in the kingdom of burgers.

Yeah, I know. It's Burger King. It's a chain. But I've got this veggie burger fix list, and honestly, the BK Veggie is my default when I'm also in a hurry. I mean, it's quick, it's easy, and BK's the only fast food place that's got a veggie burger. I mean, it's Morning Star, they can't fuck it up. Stick it in a bun, throw on some mayo, some ketchup, some lettuce, you're good to go. No cheese - you gotta ask for cheese, and I'm sure they charge extra for it, like 20 cents or something. I just spent like 5 minutes looking for the cent key on my keyboard btw - wtf? What happened to the cent key? Didn't there used to be a cent key on keyboards? Over the 6, right? Is it a Mac thing?

I have been to this Burger King on maybe four different occasions, months apart and anything I have had there has been terrible. The food has always been cold, soggy, hard, or in one case, I SWEAR my mayo was rotten on my hamburger. It wasn't that great to begin with, but when I took a bite into the middle, it was disgusting! I looked at it and it looked curdled almost. On a similar occasion we picked it up from the drive thru and everyone working there was very rude and the bag of food smelled almost rotten. They possibly had an off day or cranky manager, but it really transferred to the customer. I have given them at least the four chances, and being so far apart you think maybe something would have improved. I have gotten hamburger and fries variations all times. I will not willingly go here again!

The only reason I am rating this a 1 is due to the fact there is no 0 rating! ...  ... I typically do not go to Burger King.

Then upon using it for another, the cashier, who looked like a possible manager, swiped some card in order to get the BK card to work again. When I explained to her that I was in finance and understand how these cards work and am a little taken aback by the idea that a prepaid card would flag for risk upon an immediate 2nd use for under 5 dollars, she started getting a little rude and arrogant. ...  ... She said to me, "Well, if you are in finance, then you know that this is a prepaid debit. And.. if you are in finance then you know that there is a lot of identity theft." ...  ... She started talking about teens stealing their mother's cards. I make 6 figures. I rarely go to BK. Do I look like I stole mommy's card? ...  ... In fact, I had my son's card. LOL! ...  ... Rate this place a zero!!! These people are rude... at least those working the Sunday afternoon/eve shift. ...  ...

Burger King is a good alternative for.... (fill in the blank).    ...  ... Their broiling of burgers offers a distinctive taste and for the most part the food and service is good.  This particular location is convenient to FLW and Shea Blvd and we have found their employees to be very nice.

everything was good, service was good, the restaurant itself is very old and dingy and needs major work. major turn off from ever going back. this place needs a serious remodel.

I appreciated that the drive-thru guy was genuinely apologetic on THE DAY BEFORE CHRISTMAS that there wasn't a more reasonably priced way to get a veggie burger and onion rings. He hinted that a "meal" would be set-up in the near future, thereby allowing greater value. We'll see my friend, when I'm back in town, if this has happened. Until then, you were incredibly pleasant to buy a somewhat decadent meal from and it's no bother spending an extra few dollars to Have It My Way.

REVIEW #6:  1 stars  (1265 chars)
I wish I could leave negative stars. This establishment is by far the worst fast food restaurant I've ever been in - and I've been in a lot. ...  ... The employees here clearly hate their jobs. I always hope it would change, because let's face it, sometimes you want a dang Whopper. That was the case for me tonight. I walk in - hear the door chime to alert people I was there. I stood at the empty counter and waited. No one shows up. So I shift a little bit since there's an employee there washing trays. She makes eye contact with me then quickly looks away. I wait a few minutes longer. So after more than 5 minutes of waiting to have my order taken... I just decided to leave. ...  ... This is not the first bad experience I've had here. It's gone through a few management changes over the past few years, I always thought the service would change... but it never has. Their slogan is "have it your way", so why is that me, as a customer, asking for the fries to be cooked longer is mocked by the manager? DO YOU THINK WE CAN'T HEAR YOU? Additionally, please know that just because a person looks a certain ethnicity doesn't mean we don't understand Spanish ;)  ...  ... The floors are almost always sticky. The trash usually overflows. It's just horribly ran.

Burger King tries really hard to be as good as McDonald's! ...  ... I received a coupon from one of the Phoenix area coupons books that all school kids seem to sell these days.  The expiration was at the end of the month, so I decided to give them a try. ...  ... Wow, the menu has gone upscale!   ...  ... Now, we have good looking salads, wrap sandwiches, smoothie drinks and even Cinnabons.  Also, Burger King has this new TV ads featuring celebrities like David Beckham, Jay Leno, Salma Hayek and R&B singer Mary J. Blige.  Who sings about the ingredients of their snack wraps.  Sad. ...  ... Read more: http://www.foxnews.com/leisure/2012/04/03/burger-king-new-menu-looks-lot-like-mcdonald/#ixzz2E7SB7fqW ...  ... The one problem I see is their need to upgrade the taste of the older food items.  Their Classic Chicken Sandwich is still a piece of process meat, and the Whopper still has those little pieces of brown substance on one side of their burger.   ...  ... My last rant will be the taste of their onions, which still tastes as if they've left them out too long and have oxidized.  I know I'm going to regret it in several hours.

I purchased 2 Chicken Parmesans, and went home, apx .5 mi from store. I added a liberal amount of refrigerator ketchup, my wife a ranch from the store. About 1/3 in I realized it was raw, not a little pink but mostly. I went back to the store and spoke with manager Armando and showed him the sandwich. He said he would make two more and disappeared, no apology, nothing. Another worker dealt with us and was courteous but again not even an apology

I know that life in the fast food chain should be.... faster....but please if you give the order and one order is missing.....it's not good. Try to be accurate because driving back and complain is a waste of gas even if the store would refund. Damage control doesn't work here.

The snowbirds are back to the Sun Lakes area in force and the inept and overwhelmed staff at this Burger King couldn't handle it.  Not that they were that busy but these guys needed about 20 minutes per order and were only hitting accuracy at about 40% or so. ...  ... I haven't been to a BK in a long time so my FFF radar was down (Fast Food Fubar).  A buy one get one coupon lured us in. ...  ... I actually felt bad for one guy that seemed to be in charge.  My daughter and I stood back and watched the carnage for the first fifteen minutes waiting for our order.  Then we received our sandwiches that were not the right sandwiches.  Then we returned them and waited some more.  Then we just got a refund and left. ...  ... But during that time we watched the cashier wander around and attempt to help in a hesitant fashion as if she had never been behind the counter before.  The one guy in the kitchen seemed overwhelmed, easily confused and uncertain what the difference was between say bacon, sausage and eggs.  And the guy I felt bad for kept flitting from the drive up "Oh my God that guy has been waiting 14 minutes!" to the kitchen "No, this goes here.  We're out of biscuits!  Totally!" to bagging orders "Sir, you still haven't gotten your food?  Really?"

Burger King.. While I love Yelp, there are just some places that you go that really need no reviews. Or if they do, a small one.  Now if I were going to a 5 star resort, sure I am going to take note of everything from driving up to driving away.  But I digress..  ...  ... Fast drive thru service. Food was hot, drink was cold. The soda to ice ratio was spot on... Come on, really.. Are you going to decide to not eat here based on a Yelp review?! Nope! Its fast food. Unless there is a bug crawling out of my fries, I ain't going to bitch! Put on your Kings crown and dive in the ball pit!

"Buy one get one free Whopper" Don't count on it at this location.  I ordered a couple of #1's here, and instead of breaking it down like the store on Olive, they just charge you for both.  Don't question them about it.  When they dane to answer you, you will  get a rude and surly answer similar to "If you weren't smart enough to order it that way, your loss" ...  ... This kind of customer service does not earn your money, no matter how hungry you are

REVIEW #5:  1 stars  (603 chars)
Horrible location. Can never get fresh food. It always tastes like they made the burgers 20 minutes ago and the fries are cold. The drive thru is horrible. Literally every single time I go I am asked to pull around to the front for my order, even if no one is behind me. This is so their drive thru times look better than they actually are. The one time I was not asked to go around front they asked me to back up and pull back up. This was done so I would look like a new customer, again for drive thru times. I am done with this location. Too many other fast food chains around me to put up with that.

Ya Im giving 5 stars to a fast food place. Ive been going to this burger king forever since it is convienently right down the road from where I live. I have always had exceptional customer service there. That is my honest reason for the 5 stars. I would have probably never wrote a review for this place except for last week it was late and I was going through the drive thru for some quick burgers. The place is being remodeled so you cant go in but the drive thru was open. They had a new employee working that night. Not sure of his name but the kid with the braces gave me better customer service than I have recieved in most actual restaurants. Smily and friendly. He really stood out. That being said it made me realize that all the employees I have came in contact with there have been exceptionally nice.I have been there when they experienced thier debit machine going down and after waiting in the drive thru forever they gave me my food for free and apologized. Kudos to this location on customer service! ...  ... I suggest the double cheeseburger btw! :)

Been a while since we had Burger King, now if it was my daughters choice. This place would have a five star rating! Burger king is her favorite place to eat. But she has no choice on this! You get exactly what you expect. Fast food chain, with medicore food! Service was actually five stars, kind of hard to believe huh! But I have never been impressed with their food. Since we have moved to Arizona, wife and I have made it a point of not eating at fast food chains. And after eating here, that just reassures us of why!

I didn't go here until October, though I've walked past here for years, but much to my surprise, it's the best Burger king I've ever been to. You know what you're getting into menu-wise for Burger King, but the art work is light-hearted, and the place is open and quiet, which makes a great dining experience for fast food. The food is surprisingly fresh, and nice quality. They even have an electronic menu behind the counter which is entertaining in it's own right.

REVIEW #4:  3 stars  (807 chars)
Like the rivalry between Coke and Pepsi there are pros and cons to choosing the number 1 or number 2 option. Number 1 will always be more consistent but once in a while number 2 will turn out a surprise.  ...  ... McDonald's does the same as time wise in the drive through it seemed like it took ages to fulfill a 2 item order. They also put ranch into my not so-honey-mustarded chicken wrap.   ...  ... However, I was quite  surprised ; this ain't the tasteless burger king I remember circa mid 2000's I haven't been to a burger king since they took away the angry tendercrisp and I was happy to have gone as the food was fried fresh and was much better then surrounding fast food in taste.  ...  ... Then again they took a lot of time... ... DO I GIVE THEM  3 OR DO I GIVE EM 4  ... I went with the former

I had been craving turkey burgers in a big way, saw the add for Burger King & thought pehaps it would be a good idea to give it a try, wrong! The turkey burger was bland, and it was covered in ketchup, gross, got about 5 fries and a cup low on soda and full of ice,7 bucks of so not worth the money! ... Good thing the sign said it's only around for a limited time! You have been demoted to Burger Prince, I'll stick to buying and making them at home!

I like this Burger King the best out of all the BK's in the area. The interior is clean with employees actively maintaining it and the service is good, and the play area actually smells and looks CLEAN. The food quality is also better at this location. No complaints from me.

REVIEW #2:  3 stars  (543 chars)
Burger King is OK. Are they the best? I don't think so. Are they the worst? No. That is saved for that golden arched place. Their burgers are good and they try so hard. You kind of feel bad for them. ...  ... I don't go here a lot but sometimes a Whopper sounds good. They are the underdog you kind of secretly cheer for. The food is good. The place is clean. I like slotted spatula door handles. Service is good too. I like their fries and onion rings. Sometime you just want a cheap lunch and it is right across the street from where I work.

REVIEW #3:  1 stars  (283 chars)
Been here a couple times. The quality of the food seems to be going down, fast. The service is ok, but definitely not great. The wait for food in the drive through is pretty bad, for fast food drive thru. Won't be going here very often. Too bad, cause I used to like their breakfast.

REVIEW #5:  1 stars  (434 chars)
Okay. My first trip here in a while was breakfast time. They asked me to pull in front to wait on my hash browns. 6 minutes later I had my food. Usually when fast good places make you wait too long, they give you bigger fries. But not this place. My second trip there (the next day) I had to wait 10 minutes for my food which was also at breakfast time. Despite how delicious their breakfast menu is, I won't be back here for a while.

REVIEW #6:  1 stars  (406 chars)
Tried to overcharge me for a double cheeseburger and then when I tried to explain to the manager what happened they seemed to not have a clue how to fix (I had to explain it to them about 4 times for them to understand and then i pretty much had to spell out what they should do to make it right).  The place doesnt look very clean and I would consider this to be below the standards for most burger kings.

Pros. Fast, efficient, friendly ...  ... Cons: I'm going to stop coming here. It's not really good for me and today they didn't even bother heating up my food.

Ok, so it's a fast food joint?  How wrong can they really go?  I went in here on a Tuesday afternoon around 1:00.  There was no lunch rush happening.  Apparently this location has problems with people stealing napkins and ketchup, because there were none of the self service stations where you can load up.   ...  ... The person who took my order was incredibly rude.  There was no one in line behind me, and she kept trying to make me leave her counter while I was still putting my credit card away.  She told me where I could stand and wait 5 times.   ...  ... They pour the soda there, and she had managed to cover the outside of the cup with as much liquid as was inside.  Oh, and asking for a napkin to clean up her mess....that's a big no no too. ...  ... As I walked away, she proceeded to have a conversation with another employee about what a bitch I was for mentioning the sticky cup situation.  In Spanish.  I speak Spanish.   When they did toss my food at me, I had to ask for ketchup and napkins.  They asked how many napkins I needed. I would have asked for more if I had known that EVERY table in their lobby would be filthy.  Honestly, I probably would have felt better about eating out back by their dumpster. ...  ... Finally someone did come out to clean the lobby.  Instead of wiping the table, she simply swept up a cloud, right next to me.   ...  ... Needless to say, this had to be one of the worst Burger Kings I have ever been too.

This is by far the worst Burger King that I've ever been to. It took them about 3 minutes to help me at the drive thru, I had to repeat my order multiple times because they kept getting it wrong, and to top it off, THEY GAVE ME MILK THAT EXPIRED 2 WEEKS AGO!!

This location is without a doubt the most awful Burger King I have ever been to, including truck stops.  The employees at this location are the biggest festival of douch bags I have ever had the displeasure of being around.  Let me enlighten you with my two part story. ...  ... The first time I went to this location, I went through the drive thru.  Getting home, I now know the pain of Leo Gets in the movie Lethal weapon 2, and symphatize with him in his stance of how they always fuck you at the drive thru.  I get back home to realize I am a pawn in Burger Kings game of fucking their customers at the drive thru.  I drive back, let them know my order was wrong.  The manager looks in my bag, goes back and talks to the cook.  They forgot about me and 10 minutes later I remind him I am still waiting for my order.  He brings out a bag and drops about 6 inches on the counter in front of me.  Doesn't say a word.  I suppose this was my fault.  Pencildickmanager looked at me as it was.  O.K., perhaps they were having a day.  Perhaps I should have looked at my food when I left.   Regardless, I hope the manager is reading this.  If you are, your a dick (yes, you.  The fat guy)  ...  ... Part two, which I have entitled: Tempting fate, I decide to go back to this restaurant once again.  I should have stuck with my intuition, like when a dog knows it is about to storm and starts barking and acting weird.  Sitting in the "dining room" this time (although the amount of garbage in the room resembled more what I think the threshold to hell would look like)  I think the only place that didn't have garbage in it was the trash cans.  My food was not only incorrect, but tasted like what I can only describe as, well, for a lack of a better word..... dogshit.  I think my hamburger patty was awake longer than I was and had the texture of a belt.  I wouldn't even let my dogs eat this trainwreck of a "meal."  I told the kid who reminded me of Rainman working the counter that the burgers were pretty bad and he might want to cook some fresh ones.  He just started at me like he saw a pair of tits for the first time.  I don't think this kid will strive to be a member of the space program.   ...  ... I will never go back to this store and I hope someone who works there reads this.  Although I doubt that.  I think they are spending more time standing around thinking of ways they can piss off their customers and be generally non-productive.  I can only become religious and pray that if I ever have kids, they are smarter then the staff at this burger king.   ...  ... Much like the old lady in the movie Poltergeist, I give you a warning, Caroline.  Stay away from here, this is Satan's Burger King.

REVIEW #7:  1 stars  (592 chars)
Whopper was dry. Fries were cold. Iced tea was flavorless. ...  ... There was also a creepy old lady just sitting in there talking to everyone as they walked by. I didn't respond to her and she proceeded to stare at me the whole time I was sitting there. She also went over to a family with a little boy to tell them "he's so cute I just want to snatch him up and take him away with me". Um, okay. If I was that boy's parents I'd have gotten out of there as fast as I could. ...  ... Management: do us a favor and make the creepy people leave the place if they're not there to eat. Thank you.

I had been in meetings all day so having a healthy lunch went out the door due to the intense hunger pangs.  I decided I'd might as well go big or go home and just get a whopper slathered in mayo and ketchup. ... Figured it would be quick since there was one person in front of me and no one in the parking lot dining in....WRONG.  After 22 minutes, I finally pulled up to the window to give the person my debit card.  I waited some more and finally got my meal 10 minutes later. ...  ... Only saving grace was the whopper and fries were piping hot; however it should not have taken over half an hour.  This is not what I call "fast" food.

REVIEW #2:  2 stars  (1841 chars)
The food is Burger King food. I don't have high expectations regarding quality. I do however expect that customer service will be at least up to par with other fat food joints.  ...  ... This morning, i pulled in to grab a quick sandwich before a long day of meetings. After the car in front of me got done ordering, i pulled up to the menu, and was greeted in the normal fashion. Provided my order and got a "thank you". No total. No instructions to pull forward. So I pulled forward. Then the wait started....3 minutes......5 minutes....*shuts off engine*.....7 minutes before the person in front of me was presented with their order.....then more waiting, as the car and the girl in the window carry on a conversation lasting approximately 2 minutes. ...  ... When I finally got to the window. The employee asks "What did you want on that again?". I was a little taken back and said "So, my order has not been put in yet?". She snapped at me in a very matter-of-fact tone "NO".  Had she seemed even remotely understanding i would have just placed my order at the window. Instead I placed my money back into my pocket and began to pull away. At which point I received a very sarcastic "Byeeeeee". ...  ... For the Owners/Manager/Operators: There is very little that distinguishes your food from the other fast-food joints. I don't go because it's better. I go because it's convenient to where I am at any given time. I will, however, give my business to locations that provide stellar customer service. If you aren't communicating the need for customer service to your employees, you are failing. If your employees are not providing at LEAST a minimum of proper customer service, then they are failing you, and your bottom line.  ...  ... I won't be going back to this location any longer for food, drinks, or the occasional shake anymore.

REVIEW #3:  1 stars  (604 chars)
Avoid this Burger King at all costs! I used to frequent this place often, but over the past two years it's become awful. I highly recommend going hungry should that be the only other option. The cheese is always dry, the chicken is always soggy, and the fries are freshly cold anytime of day. I've even had terrible breakfast sandwiches here, which should be a crime. It's not difficult to make a fast food experiences worse but the employees take the cake in that category.  Avoid if you value your stomach and have to have Burger King, try the one at Broadway and Priest, the quality is worth the trip.

Burger King has finished its' remodel...and it appears to have gone high-tech. ...  ... The big display menu boards are easy to read, and the building looks to be refreshed both inside and out.  The food...it's Burger King, folks...fast and moderately priced, intended to be consumed with a carbonated beverage, and don't forget fries with that. ...  ... My experiences both pre- and post-remodel are the same.  If you are going to custom-order your food, you are better served to park the car and walk in.  Placing a custom order at the drive through, like most fast-food restaurants, is an exercise in futility.  Most who custom order do not check their order when it comes to 'em in a bag until they get to their destination...and that generally means no turning around to get the order corrected. ...  ... I have not had any significantly negative experiences here.

Not bad, not great, but it's cheap and works in a pinch.  Of course there are the upfront price you pay for at the counter and then the back home price you pay for eating it =\ ...  ... So there's all these optional questions to fill out along with the written interview saying things like, "Good for this" and "Good for that," well it's really not good for anything except filling you up with stuff that resembles food while you're on a budget.  If you can avoid it, do so.  Today just happened to be one of those unavoidable days for me.

I have an INTENSE hatred for people telling me to pull around the drive thru and wait for my food to be ready. To me, this means, "move along loser, you're inconveniencing us; even though you paid us, and waited in line for everyone else, you need to get out of line, and go wait till we're not busy enough to bother bringing your (typically cold) food out to you. That said, when people tell me to do this (typically happens at this Burger King), I put the car in park and tell them politely that I'll wait. This freaks them out, and they practically insist I move because I'm holding everyone else up behind me. I'm not trying to be a dick; I don't order 30 burgers at the drive thru. They make the BK Big Fish sandwich fresh and it takes an extra 2 minutes (yes I timed it). They're just trying to keep their drive thru times down because they're monitored and penalized if they are too high. ... O.K... Rant out of the way, I have to say that when I go in, everyone is polite and helpful. The restaurant is always clean, and quiet. The food is ALWAYS fresh, and hot. You can order lunch early in the morning, and the soda is never flat. This is why the store gets 2 stars instead of 1. Honestly, I'd rate the in store experience a 4/5 and the drive thru experience a 1/5, because they are incapable of understanding drive thru orders without repeating them 2-4 times for each item, and you can FORGET about asking for details on items. Anything you ask about, they just add to your order without explanation, even though you may not want it. Add to it, the above issue, with the lack of give-a-damn for the drive thru customers, and we have a pretty "meh" store. ... Step up the drive thru customer service Burger King!

Spent 30 minutes waiting in line on the one car in front of me.. Only to be handed my 2 sandwiches and cold cold fries. Not even slightly warm. I don't usually go to Burger King for obvious reasons but this one was recently remodeled so I thought I'd give'm a shot. Fail. Sandwiches were good.. But how do you get fries wrong? :(  disappointed.

This place gets worse and worse every time I come. If the soda machine isn't broken, then the credit card machine is down. The drive thru lane takes much longer than it ever should. They may have given the outside a face lift but I haven't had a pleasant experience since. Avoid this location if you can.

Oh my goodness!  Employees are so grumpy! ...  ... We tried to go through the drive through to get our free satisfries. We were told we could only get one order per car do we had to park and go inside.  Kind of ridiculous.  ...  ... Satisfries = meh.

REVIEW #3:  2 stars  (308 chars)
Service in the drive-thru was fast, but apparently these workers all speak limited English and cannot get the order right.  I asked for a 2-pc cinnabon meal. I got and paid for a 1-pc meal. Didnt notice until after we drove away,  because it was in a box and who pulls their stuff out while they are driving?

REVIEW #4:  2 stars  (585 chars)
This is the closest Burger King to where I live and we go here because BK is the only fast food place around that has a veggie burger for my daughter.  The problem with this place is their drive-thru.  You gotta check carefully every time you get your food to make sure you get everything you ordered.  More than once, I've brought bags full of food home to find that one or more things either didn't get entered in right or weren't given to me right. ...  ... Some places are right on and always give me what I order first time, no repeats.  This is not one of those places.  Grumble.

REVIEW #5:  1 stars  (480 chars)
They advertise macaroni and cheese and apple fries but they don't have that and they didn't even tell me. When I ordered apple fries I go through and I get apple slices with peels. For my child who is a year old that's not going to cut it with the peels. When I asked them about it they said sorry that they no longer sell it. I asked them why they advertise it and they said that it was because of corporate and not their particular facility. Not cool. And not customer friendly.

Its Burger King.. I was in the area for work and stopped here on the way out of town.. I'm not a big fast food guy in general, but when on the road, I'm usually not all that motivated to look for better places.  Anyway.. the food is Burger King food - its the same everywhere.. and what you'd expect.  My complaint here was that they had a sign on the door for free Wi-Fi.. so I went back to my car to get my laptop.  Got my food, sat down.. no Wi-Fi whatsoever.  Then again.. its Burger King.. Its not like I went there for the free Wi-Fi.. Eh.. shouldn't eat fast food like that anyway.. But for a Burger King, I guess its fine.

REVIEW #2:  3 stars  (496 chars)
Not much to say about BK.  I enjoy a few things here, but mostly because it's cheap.  The BK stacker is small, but good.  I like how they serve it HOT with melted cheese on it.  Probably need to order 2-3 of them to get full, but it's tasty and inexpensive.  I also like coming here for the cheap sundaes although they have a bacon sundae which just sounds terrible and I wouldn't try it unless it was free.  You get what you would expect from this BK, nothing to great, but it's quick and cheap.

REVIEW #3:  2 stars  (772 chars)
I've stopped here a few times on my way to Vegas.    The alternative is to fight for a parking space at MCDonalds up the street and somehow fighting to park at McDonalds just feels wrong.  The building is different than most Burger kings and has what looks to be a nice shady patio for outdoor summer dining.  ...  ... Just before 9AM they were out of biscuits.  And the restroom could use some attention.  I ended up taking a breakfast Ciabatta sandwich, which was pretty good, and a small decaf on the road with me.  The Seattle's Best version of decaf is no better than what it replaced and in the small version uses a cup that doesn't work well in my cup holders.  I'll probably stop here again in the future because it is convenient but I am still not very impressed.

I usually get friendly service here. There is often at least one error in my orders, however. This is ok as long as i eat in, which i often do since theres a HUGE, really nice indoor kids play area (which gets them an extra star!) However , when going thru the drivethru, expect a wait, and CHECK YOUR ORDER! Preferably before leaving the drivethru!

REVIEW #4:  3 stars  (833 chars)
Love Burger King, though this particular location is far from my favorite. Still, I find myself frequenting this one since it is the closest one to my girlfriend's house. ...  ... This location usually takes your order and gives it to you promptly and accurately, but there have been a few times when the staff have been a bit absent-minded. On at least one occasion, I asked for onion rings in my meal instead of fries, and just ended up getting fries.  ...  ... Another big complaint is that if you pay with a debit/credit card, they make you sign the receipt. This is the ONLY Burger King I know of that does this; I have been to at least a dozen other locations in the valley and none of them do this. ...  ... If you're in the neighborhood this place will probably take care of you well, just be sure to double-check your order.

Burger King definitely ranks as one of the better fast food chains in the USA these days. This is the closest location to my house, and needless to say, the one I frequent the most. ...  ... I have never had any real problems with this particular location. They are usually very prompt, and take your order correctly. I don't recall any occasion in recent memory on which this particular location has messed up my order.  ...  ... Burger King has a nice, diverse menu of items - chicken items, burgers (obviously), and even some other random, unexpected thing. This is one of the few fast food restaurants (if not the only one) that actually offers macaroni and cheese as a kids meal item!  ...  ... At Major/Boulder, this is a convenient location for anyone who lives in the "Old Henderson" area. ...  ... If you like Burger King, I don't have any substantial complaints with this particular restaurant. The staff do a good job, and I haven't ever had any big problems worth reporting.

REVIEW #2:  3 stars  (355 chars)
I come here all the time with my son who loves the chicken tenders.  Food is 'OK' although my favorite is the BK stacker which seems to have gotten smaller and smaller over the past few years and the price is probably higher.  Well overall the price is still pretty cheap depending on what you go for so I will always consider BK when I need a cheap meal.

It's ok, it's fast food a little better than Mc Donald's, but they have wifi, that is a plus.

REVIEW #4:  3 stars  (1055 chars)
This Burger King is nearly right across the street. Since my husband prefers this fast food joint to McDonalds, we do stop here every once in a while. Their food seems consistent and sometimes you have to wait a long time for your stuff, but it's almost always hot and fresh (can fast food be fresh?)  ...  ... I don't really eat here. I can't stomach most fast food. However, I like that I can get a 20 oz. Coke slushie here for just a buck. That makes me feel better when I have to make a special trip for one of the boys. My kids will eat anything you give them so I can't count on them for an accurate description of taste.  ...  ... The major reason why I'm writing a review is because of the customer service. A lot of times our food is just plain wrong. A lot more times they make you pull around the front so they can bring it out to you when it's done. We've had to wait upwards of 20 minutes for food before. Granted, it was 10:30pm, so I'll not be taking it too hard on them. 3 Stars because I've not had anything go so wrong as to not be back.

This is not gonna be a long review but, this Burger king on Boulder Hwy.  never has ice cream cones / shakes half of the  time.  The last couple of times I went through the drive-thru they always say: "our machine is down"  Yea, only when I come in right??  The last time I went they were running a special if you buy a certain burger combo you get a free ice cream cone. So, I asked them about that and they told me "yes you get a free cone"...Ok, I said "if your machine is down, do I get an IOU??" Then there was complete silence...Maybe they didn't know what IOU stands for.  Once again.....good ole  NON CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!!!!!!   They never respond to complaints or emails.  Thanks for NOTHING Burger queen. ( Sure glad Wendy's is just right down the street!! )

REVIEW #7:  1 stars  (612 chars)
Worst fast food service in the world! Burger King we were at your location just before noon today 5/25/14.  Seriously the girl at the  drive through shouldn't be working in the customer service industry.  It took her 3 times to get the order right and she was rood the whole time.  She asked my wife to repeat herself three time the got snippy with my wife each time.   ...  ... Don't go there the food is under cooked. They don't speak to you like you are an important customer let alone a human.  I will  listen to the reviewer who said go down the road to Wendy's.   ...  ... Keep your under cooked burgers BK

I used to eat at this burger all of the time but the other day I ordered a double whopper. When I got back to work & ate it I discovered half way through that there was one patty on it. What a ripoff!

REVIEW #4:  2 stars  (707 chars)
I've never seen a fast food place throw a burger together like this one.  And I'm not paying a compliment. ...  ... Been through several times but this last time was the worst.  Was trying the fry burger and it looked nothing like the commercial.  In fact, the meat was tiny, they globbed some condiments and threw like 4 fries in the burger and called it a night.   I could have ordered a whopper meal and made the damn thing myself better. ...  ... Understandably, it is a fast food place but perhaps it's just me.  I expect more from these joints due to their location and I've had better service at their sister places in ghettos.   ...  ... Which makes you wonder how they stay afloat at all sometimes.

REVIEW #5:  2 stars  (693 chars)
It's a Burger King.  Standard Formula, standard food. ...  ... One thing that bugs me about this location is that they ALWAYS ask me to pull forward (not to the parking lot) but just forward to get my food.  I think it's because they don't want their drive through times to go through the roof. ...  ... That being said, the food production here is slower than others I've visited and the employees at times are hit and miss.  Teenagers that give no smile, don't even say a word to you (just put your hand out for payment) and in general don't give you the satisfaction of good service while spending your money. ...  ... The food is fine, the employees here need to work on their happy faces.

I normally don't have such high expectations when i go to burger king but this is too much. Worst drive thru ever!

Okay i was super hungry when i walked in, so i expected like the usual, 5, 6min wait on my order, but the princesses in the front were to busy making their orders from del taco and writing them to one of the coworkers who was going to get it for them, they LITERALLY forgot to serve the food to 3 of the order which one of them was mine, then after 15 min ridiculous wait i asked if my order was ready they were like: what did u get? " seriously???? They looked into my ticket and were like ohh okay, then i asked for a sauce,  she throws it in the platter!!! The worst costumer service ever, they messed orders and ppl started to get angry, these girls should not do costumer service.

So disappointed! I just recently had my first Whopper and let me tell you I loved it. I went to this location ordered 2 Whoppers, 1 Fish, 1 Chicken, 1 large Fry and 1 large Onion Ring. You would have thought I ordered the entire store. I made my order at 10 am and did not leave till 10:30!! What a joke... ...  ... The asst. manager Lazaro was so checked out. He was not leading his team, the store was filthy, food everywhere. Not one person in the store seemed to care about anything. They screwed up my order 3 times and had to re make it.  ...  ... Lazaro was looking at me like I was the bad guy. Get it together people, it is just Burger King. Everything gets cooked the same way every time. So after this long awaited wait, I finally got home. Could not even finish this food, it was the absolute worst thing I have ever tasted. I think they were using old meat. I had to toss in the trash because of my fear of food poisoning. ...  ... Thanks a lot Lazaro for your great leadership skills. (NOT!!) Most people would be thrilled to have a job in this economy and do it with pride. I will never return to this location. You have most likely ruined my Whopper experience.

Ok now- I don't know what happened, or if it's just a different crew, but something happened here and the service has been outstanding. I've had to come here to use the internet for the last week, and they are SO incredibly nice, and always hustling. I can't vouch for the food still, because I'm gluten-free, but smelling everyone else's food is driving me crazy- it smells delicious.  ...  ...

This BK is near my house and I get coupon booklets in the mail often. I wouldn't eat here as much if I didn't have the coupons. The burgers are fast food average and the veggies are usually fresh. The workers are nice but the wait time can be brutal often. I do like the cinnabon options they have I just don't like when they put in the box and bag upside down so that when I open it the frosting isn't everywhere but on the bun.

I always cringe at leaving bad reviews for businesses as a whole, because chances are there are some nice, hardworking people there, even if the overall experience is generally awful. With that said, I frequent this place because it's convenient and the playground is usually pretty clean. Also, they have free wifi! ...  ... I don't eat the food anymore because I'm gluten-free, but my bf says its edible.  ...  ... The reason they get 2 stars is because they are HORRIBLY SLOW in the drive-thru, and generally in the mornings. I've seen food we ordered given away right in front of me, and then watched the new batch sit for many minutes before anyone decided to bag it up.  ...  ... The staff is generally nice, but rarely seems to care that you're there.

I've been to this location 4 times and they got my order wrong 3 times AND made me late returning from lunch. I don't expect much, I mean it's not Le Cordon Bleu but it's not rocket science either. I go out of my way to avoid fast food but had time constraints on my visits so had no alternative.  ...  ... The last guy at the window was in a spectacular mood. So much so that I was prompted to ask him if he was medicated and if so, to give me his doctor's phone number. He laughed and said he loves his job. Wrap your mind around that. He amused me for the rest of my time in the Gulag that pays my bills. He got my order right for a change so I was pleased.

I order onion rings with my food. There was a hair on the, a long hair about 4-5 inches. It was no big, I went to the counter to have them switched out, I showed them to the cashier who obviously didn't take notice. She grabbed the tray with the onion rings on them and common sence; the hair will fly off while your move the try across the front counter area. When I told the manager Lucia , I wasn't rude at all, I just wanted the onion rings repced because Cleary saw the hair. She said in Spanish no one here has long hair. I'm bilingual, she didn't know that. The ladies there have long hair. She was rude and defensive so I gave up and just said I'd like my money back. She of course kept her attitude the whole time. Burger king needs to retrain this manager Lucia to have customer service skills not just pushing paper and flipping burgers.

As usual Burger King is out of ketchup!! I wish I could give it some negative stars. The worst thing is that I've been to at least four other burger king's and have had the same problem with the ketchup, but I guess that's not as bad as the time when they ran outta buns!! You run a burger joint; how are you going to run out of the two essential things to run a burger joint?! Plus the bun is always two sizes too big for the patty. Just have sloppy made burgers. Worst chain ever!!!!

How can you knock the BK Lounge!  I just wish I lived closer to this Burger King.  I will always pick Burger King over most fast food joints.  My first job was at a burger king.  You can't beat char broiled hamburgers that are fast.  I like to get my whopper with mustard instead of mayonnaise and ketchup.  I don't understand why this confuses the employees so much.  I will ask for a mustard Whopper and I will get bread, mustard, and meat.  What the heck is that?  So I always have to carefully explain that I wanted everything except the mayo and ketchup.  Sounds like a no brainer, right?  When I don't get the juicy Whopper I like the double cheeseburger.  There is something about these little burgers that have just the right amount of meat, cheese, pickle, and mustard/ketchup.  I don't even care that they used to be $1.  I'll pay the extra .40 cents.  So if you are in the area and craving a burger fast.  Then Burger King is your place.  Cheers!

For whatever reason, if you put up a business in the Eastern Beltway Shopping Center, it will thrive. Whenever I visit this Burger King, which has been in the afternoon, the place is thriving. When the high school lets out, the environment gets too loud. ...    In my opinion, this is an average Burger King. It is not bad or great in service and food. ...    I write many of my reviews in perspective. This Burger King is a convenient meal for people visiting other establishments in Eastern Beltway Center including Home Depot, Petco,  and Walmart. Pulling onto Serene Avenue from the Burger King/ Eastern Beltway Center parking lot could be stressful and dangerous. There is only a stop sign. ...    When I am in the mood for Burger King, I will return here.

REVIEW #7:  3 stars  (816 chars)
Up until recently, Burger King had probably the worst coffee in the world. After seeing TV ads for a "New" coffee that the fast food giant was offering, I decided to partake in all the hub bub. It also didn't hurt that for this promotional period, they would be offering 25c small coffees for a couple weeks (Note: at the time this review is being written, this deal has expired, so they are normal price). The new coffee was OK. It wasn't exceptionally strong as a DD, but it didn't taste like what you would get at a jiffy lube while you are waiting for your car to be serviced. It had an extremely mild flavor. I don't like this location because when you are trying to head out in either direction on Serene Ave, it feels like a death trap, with a steady stream of cars coming from both sides on this busy street.

3 people I know, including myself, have had food poisoning from this establishment.  Figure this shit out BK... It could be from that so-called "cow" meat that you use, poor work ethic/carelessness from the employees, or as a fast food conglomerate, health of the consumers is last on the priority list.  People, do not eat this trash, it is disgusting and is a slow killer...

I went into this Burger King, as I do every day for lunch, to get a quadruple Whopper meal with a King-sized fries and XXL diet Chocolate shake.

Just as I was about to throw a molotov cocktail at the fry cook rather than order something else on the menu that is exactly the same as the Whopper, I saw none other than "The King" himself come from behind the counter with my delicious fat-free Quadruple Whopper on a plate made of solid gold.  I realized that I was part of a hilarious hidden camera gag and loosened my chokehold on the girl with Down's syndrome who was refilling the ketchup and moved the shard of glass away from her jugular.  I chuckled and promptly apologized to the employees and customers who I had scared with my voice-raising and tard-choking and happily took my food to the parking lot to eat in my Honda Del Sol as I do every day.  I took my first bite of the Whopper and realized - THERE ARE ONLY THREE PATTIES ON THIS THING!!! ...  ... By then it was too late to raise another fuss and I had to get back to my job at Chick-Fil-A.  I am, however, currently trying to build a super laser so that I can vaporize that Burger King for fucking up my Whopper.  I will never forget.

So I stopped by this Burger King to grab some food really quick, the slowest service I have ever gotten at a "FAST FOOD" joint. We got up to the order board within a few minutes but then spent almost 20 minute just getting up to the counter then had to wait another few minute at the window. The gal at the window still never acknowledge us or even turned around, after waiting a little longer we finally left because it was a completely waste of time!

I like it here. It's a nice, open restaurant, clean bathrooms, and the food was cooked well and as I ordered. What else can you ask for in a fast food place?

REVIEW #2:  3 stars  (943 chars)
I was never really a fan of Burger King. I used to like their Original Chicken Sandwich, but now it just does not taste as good as it used to. The only reason why I come here is because my husband likes the Double Croissan'wich and Hash Browns on the breakfast menu. ...  ... This Burger King is located in the Rainbow Dunes Centre and is not very hard to spot since it is the only business left in this area. Looks like there used to be a buffet, hair salon, a shoe store and more that have all sadly closed down due to the bad economy. ...  ... I have never been inside, but the drive-thru service is always pretty good. The employees are pretty nice and they have not messed up any of my orders yet. One thing that is nice is that they always seem to make a fresh batch of hash browns when you order them. They make you wait for a while, but they are still hot after I get home! ...  ... It's too bad that I only like 2 items on their menu.

REVIEW #3:  2 stars  (1246 chars)
I usually stay away from fast food, but I happened to be working in the area and was too lazy to drive further away for lunch. ...  ... Upon entry there was a BK employee on break eating BK food, always an encouraging sign when employees eat company food. Customer service was friendly, unfortunately that was about all that was good. $7.80 on two chicken sandwiches plus value onion rings. Food was below average although not terrible. What really brought this rating down was cleanliness, it seemed as though no matter where I sat a group of nats or a fly or two were sure to follow! That and the seats looked like they haven't been wiped down in days. ...  ... Now that I think about it, the last time I enjoyed BK was when I was a kid and my friends and I were in San Diego staying by the beach, we'd grab the original chicken sandwiches at night.  ...  ... Bottom line: Don't bother with this place, if you're in the area just go a bit further east and you will find much better places in Chinatown. ...  ... Customer service = 4 stars. ... Food =2 stars. ... Atmosphere = N/A ... Cleanliness = 1 star. ... Final = 2/5 stars. (based on a fast food place) ...  ... Total cost of experience = $7.80 ... What it felt like it should cost = $2.50

In my 89103 zip code, this was the highest rated Burger King. ...  ... It was a long day at work and all I wanted was a Burger. I had a couple for free satisfries with a purchase of a regular whopper. I was like, DEAL! I'm doing this.  ...  ... Located in an old stripmall, you can't miss this building. Went through the drive thru and ordered my food. When I paid, the guy just takes my card without acknowledging me. I said, "thanks." I got no response back. I thought he was dead. ...  ... My fries were stale! Gross. But other than, the burger was alright. But the service ruined it.Oh well.

REVIEW #5:  1 stars  (819 chars)
Absolutely the worst burger king I have ever been to. Has terrible terrible service. Not only rude, but slow....soooooooooooooo slow. Any time I have gone I've had to wait drive thru a minimum of 10min. Even if its one item. Absolute minimum wait time. And then when you do get your order...chances are its wrong. Its wrong or so sloppy and such a lazy job putting together-all the guts of the burger are no longer on the bun, but loaded on the wrapper. Fast food is for...fast food. They are neither fast nor are they providing the food you request. I thought it was just a particular shift there...its not. Its any time of day. Its the only business left open in the shopping center. Employees should shape up or prepare to be shut down. I'm sure someone is just waiting to wipe out that entire center and start over.

REVIEW #3:  4 stars  (1516 chars)
1.5 average? Really? It's Burger King. In the back of O'Sheas. By the bathroom. C'mon guys... why the hate? ...  ... If you make it to this part of O'Sheas, you know, the back part with the beer pong tables and the Subway and the weird Taco place and the punching bag strength machine, what really are your expectations of a BK? What are you expecting that would warrant more than 2 stars? Complimentary champagne perhaps? Red carpets? Kim Kardashian behind the register?  ...  ... I don't remember the last time I came to O'Sheas and made it to BK without being drunk. O'Sheas doesn't exactly carry the holier than thou attitude that most of the other bars and lounges on the strip do. So, most everyone here is drunk, almost drunk, hung over or drunk. Oh, and hungry. Enter this Burger King. ...  ... It's pretty cheap food. Considering how much the entrees are at Hash House a Go Go next door at Imperial Palace is, or the Cafe at Harrahs and Burger Joint at Flamingo (all within walking distance of O'Sheas and open late), the food here is a steal! We all know that, which is why we walk all the way to the back of O'Sheas to this place. It serves its exact purpose. Provide cheap, fast and greasy food. And for that, they should be admired not admonished.  ...  ... So what if you get the runs the next day. It's probably from all the alcohol anyway. So what if the employees look like the "after" shots of Faces of Meth. So what if the food takes longer than registering your car at the DMV. It's vegas, relax.

REVIEW #4:  4 stars  (660 chars)
Drunk munchies at 4am? I'm not about to throw down some double digit dough on food I'll probably vomit later. Imagine my surprise to literally stumble upon the only Burger King on the strip being called out by a "little person" announcing beer pong at O'Shea's. Beer pong was our first thought, but after realizing just how intoxicated we were figured some alcohol absorption was a better bet. Sure it's expensive for a fast food joint, but when you have to have it, cost really isn't an issue. An oasis in an overpriced food market and literally in the middle of the desert, this location gets 4 stars just for being what it is, where it is, when you need it.

Having your credit card mysterious declined when you check into your hotel is a rough start to a week long trip in Vegas.  Before I would be able to check on this strange twist of financial fate, I needed to grab a bite to eat.  Budgetary concerns lead me to this Burger King located in O'Shea's Casino.   ...  ... Big mistake.  Should have gone with a different lowbrow option like Subway or McDonald's.  After being inundated with attractive women left and right all over the strip, it was like a sucker punch to the kidneys to be served by the staff at BK.  Now, I know I'm being harsh, and they were all sweet old ladies (or at least old ladies), but damn... way to burst my bubble BK!   ...  ... The food was your standard Burger King fare, but left me feeling a bit sicker than normal.  Could have been the food, or maybe it was just the fact that while I was eating I had a front row seat to old people smoking themselves to death while playing the Penny slots.

REVIEW #10:  1 stars  (1258 chars)
This Burger King has the slowest service that I have ever experienced and the most inadequate human beings that I have ever dealt with.  Perhaps, this is mean, but I am only speaking the truth.  It is probably the smokey environment that is rotting their brain cells.   ...  ... I step up and give him my order, "#4 with medium onion rings and a diet coke."  He slowly repeats after me while pushing some buttons on his register.  So, I move on, "yeah, and a whopper junior, no mayo please."  But, he slowly repeats my first order another 2 times.  OK fine, not everyone is as quick on the ball.  So, after he gets the second part of my order, he asks me if it's eat in or take out.  I told him, "to go please" and he responds with, "OK, for here."  I seriously thought he was kidding so we just stared at each other and I didn't say anything.   ...  ... After what was nearly a 10 minute wait, our food comes out and I have fries instead of onion rings!  And the food is on a tray!  Ugh.  I did not have the patience to wait another 10 minutes to get the order right, so we just asked for a bag and bagged our order and left.  Now, I slightly feel like a jackass for writing such a mean review but I guess I need to work on my anger management issues first.

1st to review? I guess thats really no surprise word gets around that this place is BAD!! ...  ... It's been quite awhile since I've been to Burger King mostly because they microwave everything right in front of you ans then tell you it was charbroiled. I was lured in by a co-worker willing to pay and wanting to try the NEW Funnel Cake sticks. ...  ... I stay away from the burgers since they are FROZEN patties semi-broiled then microwaved. Not my kind of burger. I do however enjoy an occassional chicken sandwich microwaved or not. I ordered it MY WAY-plain. ...  ... The chicken sandwich was ok but the funnel cake sticks were terrible-like a vanilla flavored straw made of straw. I couldnt eat them, neither could my son:( ...  ... A place I wont be back to for another long while and thats not even due to the terrible service we experienced taking more than 20 minutes for 3 chicken sandwiches + 2 funnel cake sticks.

Cheesy Tots are back.  ...  ... Which means I will be be an avid visitor of Burger King while they last. I remember I was a sad panda a few years ago when they took them off the menu. ...  ... There is just something about the ooey gooey cheesy inside, and the crunchy exterior. ...  ... Also, if you didn't know Burger King has a buy one whopper, get one for $0.55 in celebration of thier anniversary. When it comes to fast food chains, I am a whopper kind of girl. The "flame broiled" taste wins me over every time. ...  ... This location is typically fast and very accomodating.  ... Due to the location you will see plenty of hookers, homeless and panhandlers outside the parking lot. Don't be surprised.

I was running errands and was starving!!  I noticed a brand new Burger King on st. Rose parkway. I headed in to grab a quick lunch. I had the whopper jr and the Oreo shake. It was the same Burger King quality no complaints. They even had one of those fancy soda machines with the touch screen. I mean don't go expecting the quality of a fancy burger place. But if you are hungry and in the area it is worth it.

This BK is right near my house. I've been inside once and the establishment was well-kept.

... they don't listen to your order.. so, they get it wrong.. you get a few huh's... ...  ... The girl who was taking the order, kept saying huh. So you want a combo. No, Just the sandwich. One of the orders was a combo meal. we get to the window. we got charged for two combos. they gave us two fries but only one drink. Come on if your going to charge me extra give me everything I paid for.... we waited till they poked there head out the little window. let them know we didn't want two combos. The Young girl maybe 17 looked at the man, who seemed to be the manager.. He said well, and pointed to the receipt. we just asked for a portion of our $$ money back. She didn't seem to have much of an idea of what she was doing and he said to her Mija, and put his hand out like ill get this. he did give us our money back.  ...  ... So we head out on the way to California. begin to eat our burgers.. SO SO Dry they fries we soggy. I was very disappointed.  we dont usually eat much fast food. but... get it together. I know its a new location but its not like your creating a plate.  ...  ... will probably give it a second shot to see if maybe they were just having an off night.

REVIEW #7:  2 stars  (1847 chars)
Have it your way...? Isn't that their slogan....  ...  ... First of all- Yes, I know it is fast food and a newly opened business, but even I hold all fast food drive thru chains to a certain degree of being acceptable and trust me, the bar is pretty low.  As I pulled up, only a couple cars were in the parking lot and one car ahead of me in the drive-thur.  When I got to the window, it looked like one of the Managers took my order.  Through the speaker, I asked him numerous times to make my order CTO: cooked to order.  If he did not know the term he should have asked instead he assumed I wanted a combo.  He seemed very rushed and overwhelmed.  He proceeded to take my order, then told me to hold but did apologize, and then asked me to repeat my order.  As he read it back to me, he left out a few specifications, and when I corrected him, he said yes, "thats what i have down...."   I told him CTO was not a combo then neglecting to give me a yes or no when i asked for my order to be CTO'ed.  The only reason why I asked for CTO was my brother said he was able to order it that way, yesterday, after a former Burger King employee that is a friend of his said he could do so.  Yesterday, that same Burger King knew what CTO meant and applied it to his order.   I finally got to the window and this kind young girl working the cash register handed me my food then proceeded to ask me, did you want a combo...?  I said no, and said i wanted my order to be Cooked to Order/CTO.  She asked both managers behind her, one of them ignored her, and the other one said NO!  My food was definitely not made to order.   ...  ... I'll still go back since it is literally right down the block, and fast food is fast food.  I'll be fair, when I get a good experience I will re-rate this place.  As of right now, I'll be kind and rate this place 2 stars.

REVIEW #8:  2 stars  (487 chars)
I don't hold any fast food joint to a high standard at all but c'mon, my entire order was wrong!  I don't eat fast food often for many reasons, now I am reminded yet again, one of the reasons why.  I did a visual inspection before leaving the drive thru and it all looked correct. But, when I got home, it was a different story. Of course, it is a gamble when ordering at any drive thru and since this is a gambling town, I will probably go back. Put it all on black and let it ride!! :)

REVIEW #9:  1 stars  (974 chars)
I totally agree with the other comments as far as at the speaker they do not seem to be listening. When he repeated my order he left out that I wanted cheese on my burger and when I asked if he got it with cheese I got no reply, I have worked fast food and so I know he was able to hear me ask. However when I got to the window the order was correct. He seemed rushed and like he had way too much to do, I did not really enjoy the salt with fried potatoe or what they referd to as "french fries" WAYYY too much salt I could not even eat them, my burger was not hot either, it was warm though. I do not expect much from fast food places however you have to try to not be good and this was by far my worst Burger King experiance. I may try them again maybe it was just a bad night but seeing the other reviews maybe this is the best this establishment is going to do. I am giving  1 star only because my order was actually correct and you cant give any less than one star lol.

The French fries were wonderful, once I received them!  I did the drive through and when I pulled up I noticed the girl who was taking money was preparing my food.

Apparently las Vegas does not have tacos at there burger king. I stood in line and when it was my turned I ordered 4 tacos and the girl looked at me as though I was crazy. She did not know what I was talking about, I told her tacos, you know like in jack in the box and she responded " we don't have tacos, try a Mexican restaurant". I couldn't believe she was so rude.

If you have driven by this burger king and never noticed it, you are not alone. It is located in a super congested area with many stores right next to thrift shop. And they have a special right now that was only supposed to last for 1 weekend are you buy 1 whopper and get 1 free. Jema took my order and she was extremely sweet and pleasant. It was very nice of her to take the time to understand the order because the last time I went to Burger King what is a very unpleasant experience. Mind you, I haven't been to burger king in at least 6 years or more, so this is a very important trip. ...  ...  ... Yeah, but my order still wasn't exactly right.

This burger King has its good days and bad days, however I've definitely seen more bad. The employees aren't the nicest. In fact I've been made fun of before through the drive thru.

DO NOT GO TO THIS LOCATION!!!!  ...  ... We just went to the drive-thru at this Burger King and the girl (Ashley) was so rude. We started to place our order and immediately she cuts us off and doesn't listen. We had to pull up to the window to place the order. Once we got to the window, she huffed and puffed the whole time and threw us attitude. Our order was thrown into the bag, the burgers were spilled out of the wrappers and the onion rings weren't even full. Both orders were half empty. Once we got home, we called back and asked for a manager. Whoever answered the phone wouldn't tell us who they were and hung up on us. They then called us back to harass us and blame us for the hang up.  ...  ... I will never go back to this location. Calls have been put into the corporate office. Will update once we see what they are going to do.

This is probably the third time that they have forgotten to put something in my bag. The first time I didn't check and I drove all the way home and found out that I was missing a burger. Today I went and I went through the drive thru to order food for my brothers and sister and I had to wait in front of the restaurant....which was just fine. However, I checked the bags when I got them and I did a double check and a triple check. Yep, I was missing a burger....and then I checked my receipt to make sure it was on there. Yep, still missing a burger. I had to get my lazy butt out of the car (hence that is why I was going through the drive thru) and walk inside the store. They were very accommodating and I needed that burger with 3 teenage boys and a growing girl....I needed all the food that I ordered. Overall, food is ok for a fast food joint.

Before our move to Vegas and the experience of eating a six dollar burger, the "WHOPPER" was the best burger we'd eat. Maybe it was a limited choice, but it was one we, my husband and I enjoyed regularly.  ...  ... So going back to Burger King and trying the whopper after a few years of having skipped them, was a bit disappointing! I don't know if it was the late night order, we went around 8oclock at night, or they have lost some of their flavor.  ...  ... The bun was dried out, the burger had no flavor, and the best thing about the meal was the french fries. I know that consistency plays a big role in any fast food place, but I don't know if I want to try again, I was that disappointed.

My experiece with them is a so so to below average. Not too long ago, I had purchased a meal deal through drive through one morning. I was told to park in the front and wait for my food, I noticed two customers after me was told to park in the front as well. after 5 minutes of waiting I noticed one of the employees had a meal, she denied it was mine. Patience was not a virtue with me that day. The Second customer after me got his meal. Noticing that I was first and had not yet gotten my food was not right. So I walked in and asked whats goin on with my order, the employee asked for the second time what I had ordered *the order she denied it was my order was really mine*. ...  ... I did call the manager that morning and expressed my dismay for a lack of communcation and slow food. He did the right thing and gave me a complementary meal and he had let me know what went wrong that morning (the cook was MIA). when I had showed up at the store, he had personally came from his office and apologized for the mess up. ...  ...  ...  ... I thought all was well until I had ordered my comp meal that the employees may have been messing with me? (its just a theory). Three other customers after me got their meal before I did. So I had walked over to the shift manager and asked if my meal was ready, his stupid ass response was "I was wondering why that sandwich was sitting there". I got my food and left. ...  ... I would travel a distance in the other direciton to another burger king that has excellent speedy service vs this one. ...  ... I'm glad that I dont have stock in this company. ...  ...

My husband went there for breakfast and had to go back 3 times because each time they got his order wrong. It's not hard to read the screen on an order. A few times I went there through the drive-thru the person could barely speak English, wow!!!!!!! I should have to speak another language other than English just to get my food order across and get it correct the first time.

As I was on my way to the gate but my tummy made me veer left and hit up BK.  ...  ... The service was outstanding this late at night. I was helped by two pretty girls and they seemed to enjoy what they do. If your having fun with your job and are more than happy to answer questions, heck even ask a few, you earn a 4 star rating.  ...  ... I ordered a Chicken Tendercrisp Sandwich Grilled with no mayo. It took a few mins for my order but I could tell it was freshly made. The sandwich had two warm buns, a piece of grilled chicken topped with a red tomato and some green lettuce. Pricing was not an issue as I expected this to be more than what you would normally pay.  ...  ... Maybe I caught them on a good day, either way the sandwich was great.  ...  ... If I'm in this neck of the woods my next flight I'll definitely stop by again.

REVIEW #4:  4 stars  (520 chars)
BK is always my favorite fast food joint. Had lunch here before catching my flight to Denver. ...  ... I ordered the BK Big Fish sandwich - with cheese and onions added. For some reason the BK Big Fish was not listed on the menu - so I asked first. ...  ... They had three cashiers working the line and they were moving it quickly. And the expediter was cranking out the food to hungry customers rapid-fire. ...  ... The sandwich must have just come out of the fryer, Hot, crisp, cheese was melted, and oh so damn tasty!

REVIEW #5:  4 stars  (214 chars)
MMMM i love BK! I thought that having this place in the airport was amazing! The prices seem a bit higher though which I really hate but the taste and stuffing was delish!! great time to eat while waiting to board.

REVIEW #6:  4 stars  (307 chars)
When Spirit airlines is delayed for days, burger king is a savior. I got a whopper at 10:30 PM, and they loaded my bag with all sorts of sauces. ...  ... this kept me moderately happy for our 3 hour delay until 2AM. ...  ... a little pricey for a BK, but its the airport. you are trapped with airport prices

REVIEW #7:  3 stars  (148 chars)
Food isn't any better nor worst than any other burger king. This location, however, is extremely expensive. It costs around $9 for a double whopper.

REVIEW #8:  3 stars  (381 chars)
I almost feel like I HAVE to review this BK because the only time I eat BK is when I'm at the airport, particularly at this one at McCarran! HA! Don't forget that breakfast only goes til 10am ;) ...  ... They're pretty good w/ the quickness but it's called fast food for a reason :p  The best part is you'll meet all sorts of interesting people while you're eating here.  Oh Vegas!

REVIEW #9:  3 stars  (505 chars)
I normally do not eat fast food, but desperate times call for desperate measures.  I got my whopper with cheese and fries and took it back to my terminal.  The food was fast and hot when I got it.  Tasted pretty good going down, but then again I was starving!  Within 5 minutes of consumption I remembered why I don't eat fast food.  It had nothing to do with this location, fast food just hurts my tum tum.   ...  ... Also have to mention that it was the only place open in the middle of the week at 8pm.

REVIEW #10:  3 stars  (520 chars)
It's an airport Burger King, what am I supposed to say about it. I know, why don't I take pictures of the food, because that's just helpful as f**k.  ...  ... I was wavering on giving them a 2 or a 3, but went with the 3 because I was changing planes at 9:45 p.m. and had about 4 minutes to wolf down some food, and they came through. Half the shops and restaurants were closed at that hour too, but this is one of the ones that stayed open, so props to them. ...  ... Of course it's expensive, genius. It's the airport.

REVIEW #11:  3 stars  (156 chars)
It's burger king! If you don't know about it....try it. Their Burgers are good but their milkshakes are better! Try a milkshake! Then go play slot machines!

REVIEW #12:  3 stars  (401 chars)
It's just another Burger King. Seating is combined with sbarro pizza next door. There is not enough seating space at most times as I have been here several times. Tables are often dirty and no one goes around often to clean. The menu selection has less items than regular burger kings and prices are higher than regular burger kings. ... If you are in hurry it provides a quick option for grab and go.

REVIEW #13:  3 stars  (216 chars)
Over priced but the croissants are great. The combo meal was almost $9 partially because they make you purchase the large drink. I guess overall it's cheaper and better than buying snacks, sandwich, etc on the plane.

REVIEW #14:  3 stars  (965 chars)
The D terminal at McCarran Interanational airport is pretty new. You have to take the little shuttle train to get out there, and after that, you have to walk out toward a big atrium and go up a 2 story escalator.. ...  ... Of course you have to pass some ubiquitous slot machines on the way to your gate. This is mostly a United Airlines terminal.  ...  ... It isn't a shopping mall like the main terminal is, but it is less crowded and congested, wnd clean.  ...  ... This Burger King is one of the choices you have to eat out here. There are the usual fast food airport  suspects serving, well, fast food, so  this is as good as any.  ...  ... We have over the past 10 years  traded in airline food for terminal fast food, what with the airlines competing on price and still losing money. And we are spending more time in the terminal than in the plane. Not sure which is better or worse. At least in the terminal, you have a choice of more than chicken or pasta.

REVIEW #15:  3 stars  (835 chars)
The food is pricey but so is all the other food in any airport - whether it's a chain restaurant or one you have never heard of.  So I suggest you eat before heading to the airport, when you get to your destination, or you take snacks (just no liquids the airports will make you throw them away, even with an unbroken seal). ...  ... The location is big and shares it's space with other food vendors. ...  ... The burger king in terminal C is a little hidden, it's behind the restrooms, shoe shiner, starbucks, and at the very end of the boarded walkway - there's a lot of construction going on. ...  ... Absolutely no free refills as another yelper posted, there are 2 fountain drink dispensers in the lobby w/a big sticker stating refills $0.79 - maybe if it's crowded and the staff won't notice you but then again it's not worth it.

REVIEW #16:  3 stars  (998 chars)
There are two Burger King's that I generally visit when I'm at the Airport in Vegas.....one in the C Gates area and the other is in the A/B Gate area.  This review is for both of them...... ...  ... They're always busy, so it's not always guaranteed that you can "grab n go" with the food.  The seating area in the C Gate area can also get very busy.....the seating at the other location is usually open because the customers at the A/B Gate location usually get their food and go to their gate since it's at a fork between the 2 gate areas and there's still a 2-3 minute walk to the actual gate.  Keep that in mind if you're planning to grab a bite before your flight. ...  ... The food is.....well, it's fast food and doesn't taste any different than the locations outside of the airport, just realize the cost is 50% higher.  The service level is decent, not great. ...  ... Overall, it's a solid place to grab a quick bite and deserves the 3 Star rating in my book. ...  ... Return Factor - 70%

REVIEW #17:  3 stars  (755 chars)
This Burger King is in McCarran, after you pass through security. It's my default meal choice when I'm stranded here. ...  ... It's tradition for me to have a light lunch or dinner here before flying out (I even impulsively got onion rings here once after arriving in Vegas). Yes, this Burger King is reliable, but the sad truth is that airline food sucks a big fat one. Anyone else notice that this Burger King always seems to be expensive, and it's not just the sales tax talking? (It's not quite price gouging, but it comes close for fast food.) Thank goodness they take credit cards. ...  ... For many, it's easy to succumb to Burger King's greasy goodness - the other businesses in this terminal don't offer much, anyway - TCBY's, I'm looking at you!

REVIEW #18:  2 stars  (479 chars)
Decided on BK during my stopover in LV. It was the only place that looked appealing during breakfast time. Busy BK and luckily I had time during my layover to head to this side of the terminal. It was a LONG walk...  ...  ... Ordered the egg/cheese/sausage croissant sandwich meal with OJ. It was enough to tie my over for my hour flight. The hash browns were hot and fresh, which I really enjoyed.  ...  ... It was just an arm and a leg to pay for this meal... To be expected...

REVIEW #19:  2 stars  (435 chars)
For some reason I had a craving for a bk cheeseburger. Maybe it was all the Eclipse commercials. (Team Edward!/team Taylor!)   Either way I entered here on the wrong side and followed the rat maze to the counter. Whopper meals are almost $8! I ordered a cheeseburger for me and chicken tenders and fries for my son plus drinks for a total of almost $16!!!  The burger was fine but the fries were disgusting. I wish they had a USO here.

REVIEW #20:  2 stars  (108 chars)
I just don't understand charging 8 or 9 dollars for a breakfast combo.   At least it's quick and consistent.

REVIEW #21:  2 stars  (224 chars)
I needed a quick dinner in during my stopover so I raced to my usual fast food at McCarran. ...  ... I ordered the Whopper Jr combo ($8), of which is the most inexpensive combo meal available. ...  ... = HIGHWAY ROBBERY.....

REVIEW #22:  2 stars  (1185 chars)
I try not to have high expectations for fast food joints, so I can only judge on the customer service experience and the price.  My cashier was rude and really made me feel like I was an idiot for requesting an ICEE instead of a fountain drink.  He kept saying, the fountain drink is included in the combo and I will have to charge you additionally for the the ICEE.  ...  ... Sir, who cares? If I asked for an ICEE, give me my ICEE!! Why are you try to pinch my pennies??  ...  ... In a state of confusion, I took the fountain drink cup and then realized that he really did NOT give me my ICEE! I went back to the counter to let him know that I still wanted my ICEE.  He said, "Ma'am, I told you that was extra money, the fountain drink is already included."   ...  ... Huh? Where is my ICEE?? Are you even going to ring it up? ...  ... In short, I ate my combo without an ICEE because my cashier refused to ring me up for it.  I guess, he just thought was would be a waste of my money to purchase an extra drink when one was already included. ...  ... Even for an airport, the prices are crazy.  You are looking at $10 for a combo meal.  Seriously?!? ...  ... I still want my ICEE!!!

REVIEW #23:  2 stars  (297 chars)
No complaints on food!  The only reason it is getting 2 stars! ...  ... The PRICE is ridiculous!  $8.99 for a breakfast meal?  Seriously?  Rip off!!   Probably because we were at the airport & hungry with little choices!! ...  ... I will stick to TX Burger King's where they aren't out to ROB you!

okay I'm a fan of the BK Lounge, but wow... not at this price. ...  ...

CONS- ... * PRICE !! ... * No value items ...  ... TIPS- ... *  If you can avoid eating at the airport, do it because the prices are ridiculous.  I ordered a breakfast combo and an extra orange juice.  The total came up to right under $13.00! ... * order your fries without salt to assure you get piping hot fries (or hashbrowns) then you can add your own salt at the condiment counter. ... * if you are at the airport waiting... keep your cup and you can take advantage of their beverage station (free refills) ... *

REVIEW #25:  2 stars  (174 chars)
Pricey fast-crap served by rude people. The food was sub-par (even for Burger King) and cold when I received it. If it wasn't for the pure convenience, it would get a 1 star.

REVIEW #26:  2 stars  (261 chars)
The combos were over priced as in are we in a foreign country which devalues the American Dollar? Oh no, we are in Vegas, and an airport nonetheless. The fries were fresh but tasteless cafeteria style and the dining areas were filthy.Burger was pretty standard.

REVIEW #27:  1 stars  (843 chars)
Airport is airport food, not the best and kind of expensive. But when your here you have no choice. Went cause I was craving a whopper. But as soon as I got there I should have stopped and turned back around to look for something else. There was a man infront of me who had complained about his burger, I should have token that as a sign. But no. I ordered a whopper with extra onions (which is $1 extra)  and went my gate . Which was a pretty far walk from their only Burger King location. Take a bite of it and its cold and only find two slices of onion. I was really upset because I had to pay extra for it. And also, who doesn't put any pickles in a burger. If your burger on the screen is advertised with pickles, I'm sure it needed to have pickles. Never again will I go there. I will happily walk myself to the E gates to get Carl's jr.

REVIEW #28:  1 stars  (541 chars)
I hate Burger Kind in general so this might be a biased review, but I'm always disappointed at how much flavoring they must use on their meat and how many chemicals they mist put into their fries to make it seem like they have charbroiled burgers [because obviously they're not] and thick cut fries [because, obviously, they're not].  ...  ... Their spicy chicken sandwich is pretty good but at what cost? I always wonder how much of their chicken is really chicken as well so I refrain to even indulge in that whether or not I'm in a hurry.

REVIEW #29:  1 stars  (525 chars)
I realize it's completely pointless to review an airport Burger King, but seriously this was the worst cheeseburger I've had at a BK. I know that customer traffic is spotty so they keep a bunch of burgers in the warmer, but throwing a warmed over hamburger onto a cold bun, plus a slice of cold cheese, plus cold condiments does not make a cheeseburger. And adding french fries that have clearly been sitting around for ages does not sweeten the deal. I will gladly wait for a fresh meal without complaining. Bad Burger King.

REVIEW #30:  1 stars  (371 chars)
If you're leaving Vegas, know that this is the very last time you will have to shell out an ungodly amount of money for pure crap.  ...  ... We just wanted a nice refreshing soda with ice and a straw to sooth our yucky tummies. Little did I know that two small sodas would cost $6.25.  ...  ... $6.25!!!!!!! ...  ... What a gigantic rip off. Complete usuary. Eff you, BK.

REVIEW #31:  1 stars  (613 chars)
On my way back from vegas, i thought of having a quick lunch at this burger king located within airport premises. I ordered a burger. First it around 20 minutes for them to serve it, ridiculously long for a fast food joint located at airport, with around 8 people staffsize, but to add to a misery, the burger served was with burned buns and yes!..the buns were charred black from inside!! Didnt get a chance to raise my concern with the outlet manager since i was running late to board my flight. But overall it was the worst possible burger experience i had till date. Would NOT recommend this place to anyone..

REVIEW #32:  1 stars  (127 chars)
Shockingly rude service from one of the girls here and very overpriced. Good burger though as its BK. This BK is airside at T2.

REVIEW #33:  1 stars  (572 chars)
The employees are honestly the worst I've seen at any fast food restaurant. You're in an airport, so you would expect fast service. They're lazy and not at all polite. Also the soda machine was totally out of order, yet they were still charging people for combo meals. ...  ... I'm not one to pick on fast food restaurants, but this one is as bad as it gets. There aren't a lot of options at McCaren, but you might want to try anything else.  ...  ... Also your standard combo meal is over $10. Rarely will you see that at one of the big burger chains, even at an airport.

REVIEW #34:  1 stars  (930 chars)
There are actually two different BKs at LAS, but this one is sure to have the same apathetic employees and the most overpriced fast food I have EVER purchased as the other location.  Realizing that BK can hit you up one last time, everything here is DOUBLE the normal retail price as back home--wherever your home is.  $9.89 for a regular Chicken combo?  $3.50 for an extra order of fries? ...  ... OK, so my butt didn't need the extra order of fries, but you guys!!!  I thought the whole point of eating at airport fast food places was so that we could avoid those strangely-named snack shops that used to be in airports 20 years ago.  Like, "Karen's House of Nuts and Pies" or "Ye Olde Sausage Hut."  Anyone remember what it was like in those days before McDonald's was able to push its way in?  Well, thank you BK for showing me that $14.79 is never too much for an abysmal chicken sandwich, medium drink, and two medium fries.

REVIEW #35:  1 stars  (277 chars)

Worst location in entire country. A Dbl Whopper Meal & 3-pc Chicken Strips, $17.50 ...  ... 2 people in line and it takes 12 minutes to get an order? ...  ... Chicken Strips had been re-heated at least 3 times. Asked for sauce to smother the leather, was told Id have to pay extra. Threw one on the floor and it sounded like a golf ball bouncing.

Since opening, we have been to this Burger King 5 times. ... I will not be back for a couple months... That should give them time to figure everything out. ...  ... We have encountered issues with orders, prices, and wait times, despite visiting at various times of day. The staff appears to be new, not just to Burger King, but to speaking with people who are paying for products. ...  ... On my most recent stop, around 7am on a weekday, there was only one other car in the drive through. I ordered a breakfast combo with a large coffee. The items did not come on the screen. I was instructed to pull around to the window. When I got there, the price was more than $1 over what it should have been. I asked way, and this is where it got bad... ...  ... The attendant told me "it just is, that's what it costs. What, you wanna look at the receipt?" ... I said yes, "I am going to look at the receipt." I was given  bag of food, then, he handed me the small receipt, without saying a word. I saw what it was, and decided not to make any more of an issue... BUT then, he gave me a cup of coffee that was not filled, followed by a handful of cream and sugar packets... Not in a bag, not in the bag with the food, just dumped them in my hand and closed the window again... ...  ... So, what was the problem with my order??  ... He rang each item in individually, resulting in a higher price. ... AND did not include the potatoes in the bag.  ...  ... I stop for breakfast or coffee only once ever few weeks as a treat. ... $5 every day adds up, so my family avoids wasteful daily stops. ... This was my first "treat" in about 3 weeks and it was terrible. It was a waste of my time and my money AND cost me more off both than it should have.

I was the only customer. A little after 10 am,  so when I ordered a sausage Croissant  with egg and cheese no problem right!!!   Wrong I got ham instead she did not include a receipt because she was too busy chatting with her buddy inside. I did not notice this till I got home and this is the very first time I did not get a receipt so I could have brought it back to make them give me what I ordered.   Hey guys CUSTOMER SERVICE PLEASE!!!!!

I will not return to this burger king Ever! Being new you would think they would have a higher standard. The forgot the fries with the meal order. When the fries did come they tasted like they were cooked the day before, luke warm  stale and card board texture! The two sandwiches I ordered were not much better, they tasted as if they cam from a am pm connivence store! Very disappointed with this location. I wont be back!

on Thursday the 15th of August at approximately 8:30 pm I placed an order of about a dozen burgers for my pee wee football team and I was short on my order, ..I guess counting burgers isn't a part of customer service now at days, maybe a little basic math course should be included in the hiring process?

REVIEW #8:  1 stars  (1137 chars)
Went in at 10 am on a Saturday.  Two people ahead of me that had placed their order and one at the car window.  Five people including the "Manager" behind the counter and it took them 4 minutes to take my order.  Sat down and one of the people waiting for her order started bitching that she had been waiting for over 15 minutes and what was the problem.  Another lady came in and the manager took her order and walked off.  After nine minutes I went back and asked if it was training day because they were really taking their time and the cashier said "No...just another day."  The manager walked by and I asked if she was the manager and she said  "Si".  I asked her if she knew what she was doing because now I had waited 13 minutes and still no order.  The woman that the manager helped asked if her order was in because the manager had not taken her money and she said no and she left.  A few people came in and out and heard the problems and left.  After 17 minutes I finally got my order.  This Burger King will not be open in a year and if you hire management they better care about the job and be smart enough to handle the job.

So excited about a major fast-food chain having a good veggie burger!  Presenting the MorningStar farms veggie patty, not the yucky fake-beef tasting patties, ahem, Boca, such as Fat Burger and sever other places serve. A little over-cooked (hard around the edges) but I'm so psyched that I can grab something on-the-go that is standard on the menu.   ... Kudos to BK for leading the industry in offering VEGETABLE patty sandwiches on-the-go.

Here's a quick one.  Burger King? Ok.. Drive-thru? A little slow. Flame-broiled? Sometimes. Microwaved? Right in front of you. Napkins? Just one. Anything special? Yeah, its on Cheyenne & Rainbow. ...  ... Here's some advice, to avoid the microwave effect and get actual flame-broiled meat, ask for no cheese. On the buck doubles at least. Works everytime for me!

One time while I was here while ordering inside, the cashier stopped taking my friends order while he was talking, just to answer her cell phone and spoke for a good 90 seconds.   ...  ... Even after his jaw dropped, she didn't break character and acted like it wasn't a big deal. ...  ... Luckily I don't expect any customer service going here, I just thought that was hysterical when it happened.  Overall though, very consistent, I love the food (well, it's a good value), and they are fast. ...  ... No real problems here, A-OK in my book.  Just make sure none of the workers have to make a call or have a call coming in.

REVIEW #5:  2 stars  (1281 chars)
What a poor experience I had at the BK location.  I admit that I am not the biggest supporter of the King.  I am more of a McD's guy myself.  But when BK has something that catches my eye like a special sale or a new item, I check it out.  This is what happened the other day.  They were offering the Original Chicken Sandwich for just $1.04.  The price was right but the food was all wrong.  The chicken was over cooked and taste burnt.  It had become chewy after sitting under the heat lamps for a while.  The lettuce was barely there and very wilted.  The mayo was and the verge of being bad.  I had to add pickle relish to the sandwich to make it edible.  And my disapointment does not end there.  I also ordered the new sweet potato fries.  Horrible.  I only ate them becauase they cost $1.89 and I am not in the habit of throwing that down the drain.  The fries were over cooked, soggy, and chewey and rather tastless.  Just sort of starchy.  They could have used a little salt which, coming from me, says a lot.  I rarely require salt on anything.  I have been to this BK location before and I'll likely come back again based on nothing more than convenience.  It is close and sometimes a Whopper or a double cheese burger sounds good.  It is far from being my first choice.

This was as bad as it gets.  I waited in the drive through that evening for 5 minutes before driving up to the window.  I assumed there was something wrong with the speaker or mike.  When I got to the window there was 2 guys chatting with each other and very loud music playing inside.  I sat there for about 3 minutes while being completely ignored.  I finally left.  I promise I will never go through that drive through again.

I was starving for breakfast, it was 10:34 when I rolled into the drive thru (thanks to the idiot driving 10 miles under the speed limit and me being stuck behind him on 215). I'm from the East Coast where BK does breakfast on Sundays until 11 am, thought I was safe. However when I got into the drive thru, they informed me that they were no longer serving breakfast. However, Nicole (from Kenmore, NY) the drive thru girl went and asked the cooks if they could make me a breakfast burrito and they very sweetly did. The burrito was delicious and the service was even better. So I want to thank the staff and especially Nicole and the young man also at the window. They really went above and beyond the call of service and I will certainly be heading up to this BK again and will be calling corporate to let them know that they have got some great employees at this store.

So I usually only go thru the drive thru when it's super late, and to be truthfully honest I do like McDonalds more but sometimes you get that urge for a Whooper!

Stop by if you get a chance, oh and if your not in the mood for a Whooper try their double cheese burger with king sauce, it's Great!!

Burger King as a whole isn't exactly leading the pack in any category as far as fast food, and finding a nice location can be challenging. The employees are generally awful, the food one step away from being unacceptable and they never seem to be clean. This one doesn't strive to get past that, or really do anything beyond the bare minimum of what's expected. ...  ... This is important to know if you care about your order being correct. Every single time I go here, without fail, they get the order wrong in pretty major ways. Number of items, toppings, side selections, it's total crap shoot. Even the act of ordering turns into an ordeal as communication consistently falters. I don't know if they have trouble hearing me, if it's the language barrier or they just don't care. I believe it's all three. Just pay us and go! ...  ... Food quality is consistently average. Not horrible, but still soggy, greasy, and otherwise hastily thrown together with all the care of a child putting away toys. And it's never warm enough. Eating here always leaves me feeling kind of gross, enveloped in a cloud of shame. But what really makes me never want to go back is how clearly lazy and spiteful the service seems to be. Asking for one burger to be different from another is too much work. Frying the rings long enough to be crispy takes too long. Keeping track of who's who in the drive thru... they're not getting paid enough for that.

Refuses to get order right. You orser a whopper with no onions.....how hard is that to accomplish.  Be ready for them to mess up a simple order.

REVIEW #7:  1 stars  (220 chars)
Don't think I'll be going here again. My fries were soggy and almost raw and my "premium" chicken sandwich (#6) was disgusting. I took two bites and trashed it. I don't expect much from fast food but this was just gross.

REVIEW #8:  1 stars  (487 chars)
Easily the worst Burger King in Vegas.. Maybe the nation. Last night I went though the drive thru because I wanted to try the new whopper, after waiting 20 min. I finally get my order and bring it home only to find out it wasn't my order.. Tonight I go there because I really want to try the new whopper and again after waiting 20+ min. They forgot half my order. I won't be back. And if the owner does end up reading this review then he should seriously consider finding new management!

REVIEW #9:  1 stars  (446 chars)
It's been a couple years since I got a whopper at BK... And it was horrible.. I remember I used to get these on base all the time and the burgers were flame broiled and pretty damn good. These burgers taste like frozen AM PM PATTIES.. Just gross.. The franchise must be under a new CEO  or owner but I will not come back..  I didn't want a .50 cent burger for $6 ... Where we check the box where it says "Good For" there should be a "nothing" box

REVIEW #10:  1 stars  (1370 chars)
We went to this Burger King for supper on Saturday night before we went grocery shopping... My husband ordered the new bacon cheddar stuffed burger meal and I ordered a whopper with cheese. We also ordered a 10pc chicken nuggets.  My husbands burger was sooo burned it was actually black!! and much smaller than the bun was.  The chicken nuggets had obviously been sitting for quite some time..they were shriveled up and dried out looking and they tasted quite nasty!! We had them at a different BK a couple of weeks ago and they were hot and fresh and very tasty there when they were fresh!!! These ones were awful!!!   We thru them out!! At one point as we were eating, my husband told me to look towards the kitchen area, so I did... What we assumed to be the manager, was standing by the fryer, picking his nose!!!!!  This is not something you want to see right after your food just came from there!!  They had some kind of Jazz music playing that was not relaxing or enjoyable... after my husband took the three what was suppose to be onion rings off of his very burned burger, he tried to eat it but could not finish it, it just wasn't edible... the onion rings were either very old and hard or fried waaaaay too long because he could not even bite into them... This meal was just not a good experience at all... I don't think we will be going back to this BK!!!!!

Why would i pick a that fast food restaurant instead of that one? Because of the SERVICE! ...  ... Doesn't the service add taste to you burger? I mean this staff was Phenomenal! They actually give it to you "Your Way." Food was fast and workers we're very friendly. They go an extra mile just to see you smile :). They took time on the whoppers making sure they look like the pictures.  ...  ... This specific locations is the king of all whoppers :-D

REVIEW #2:  4 stars  (297 chars)
Plain and simple, this location has never messed up my order.   ... They are quick, they are friendly, and they are clean. ...  ... This location is super close to work, so I'm here frequently.   ...  ... they have a great selection on their "value" menu... ...  ... Oh and I LOVE the new fries!!!

REVIEW #3:  3 stars  (843 chars)
Its a typical fast food restaurant. Its very clean in the mornings when I arrive. ...  ... Today I decided to write a review as I watched the manager and her staff dance around asking a homeless women to leave their parking lot.  ...  ... Now she wasnt bothering anyone. I saw her when I arrived and watched her from my seat and she was just sitting in the shade of the building and wasnt begging for change or hand outs.  ... The employees said she is gross but since she bought a coffee we cant ask her to leave for at least an hour. Ive been here dressed in my business casual for more than an hour and nobody has looked at me with the same disgust or approached me to say its time for me to go. ...  ... The food is typical and as long as you are employed I guess you will be treated like a regular citizen worthy of a whopper with cheese.

REVIEW #4:  3 stars  (308 chars)
This is fast food so it's obviously nothing too special.  You get exactly what you would expect.  I mostly enjoy coming to BK because of the cheap menu items.  A simple BK Stacker/Fries/Drink/ and a sundae will cost me less than $6.  This specific place is usually fairly clean and the service has been good.

REVIEW #1:  3 stars  (1707 chars)
Wow,  I'm really surprised that this location has yet to be Yelped.  This particular BK Lounge is located inside Las Vegas Premium South Outlets (better known as the Belz Outlet to those who've lived in Vegas for awhile).  There isn't much to be said about Burger King.  We are all familiar with its' offerings and prices.  I don't really venture to Burger King for killer food, its more of a convenience factor.  Anyhow. . . A- Okay on this BK.  ...  ... Pros: ...   *  They have the Whopper on the Breakfast menu. I thought there was breakfast whopper, but no.  Just the regular whopper on the breakfast menu.  Strange, but cool! ...   *  open a little earlier than the mall.  If you find yourself needing to be one of the first consumers at a store in this mall, you can come here to grub prior to getting your shop on. ...   *  I got a 10% discount.  I've been here enough (sad but true). ...  ... Cons: ...   *  No Drive Thru window (obviously ... it's in the mall) ...   *  Super loud in the food court especially during lunch hours.  Don't expect to be able to talk to the rest of your party without having to yell across the unbalanced table. ...    ... Overall: ...   Again, this is Burger King.  If you don't know, now you know. ...  ... Tips: ...   *  You can request your favorite music video while you eat in the food court ( regular texting fees apply) ...   *  If you are going to eat there with someone and you want to converse while eating, avoid sitting under the flat screens that are suspended 12 ft. in the air blasting music videos. ...   *  Bring cash.  Yes they take plastic, but there have been numerous times that their credit card machine goes on strike.  I speak from experience.

REVIEW #2:  2 stars  (526 chars)
This location is inside the Belz (Las Vegas Premium Outlet South) Outlet in one of the food courts there.   ...  ... There are not any food options at the two different food courts at this outlet mall.  This Burger King is the best option when it comes to having a meal here.  It is not one of the best Burger King locations that I have been to.  The menu is the same as the other BK's. ...  ... When you come to this outlet, try to make sure that you eat something first.  If you're really hungry, then this is your best bet.

Newest Burger King in Las Vegas and it features a completely redesigned decor, it's very bright plus it has entertainment technology throughout. There are several flat screen televisions and they allow you to change the channels. ...  ... There is free WiFi, but I wasn't able to get it to work on several devices. Hopefully, that's a minor issue that will be fixed soon. The most exciting part of the visit was the, "make it your way" Coke machine. There are 100's of possible drink combinations with this device. Everyone had a great time making mixed drinks.  ...  ... Getting to this location is easy, but not to leave. If you need to go South on the Las Vegas Strip, you need to go North for a few blocks in order to do a uturn. This can be a problem for this location in terms of sales.

REVIEW #2:  4 stars  (883 chars)
Being the fast food fan that I am I am glad to see that Burger King opened a new Las Vegas restaurant. For awhile it looked like Burger King was making a slow disappearance from Las Vegas. ...    I am also a cola fan. The star of the newest Las Vegas Burger King is the computerized Coke machine. Normally I am impressed if a restaurant has strawberry soda. There are 105 flavors. What is also impressive is the amount of diet colas. ...    The restaurant itself is on the small side. The interior is modern. And it is clean. ...    The employees were friendly. ...     Despite its location on Las Vegas Boulevard, a couple of miles south of the Strip proper, it is difficult to find. It is just south of the outlet center, between Windmill and Warm Springs on the east side of the road. ...    My chances of returning are high. There are 95 flavors of soda that I would like to try.

REVIEW #3:  4 stars  (558 chars)
I pass by this Burger King all the time, but it's usually during a time when I don't have the time to stop in and eat food. It's also in a location that kind of sucks to get to if you're coming in from the other direction. ...  ... I stopped in one morning for breakfast. While there were plenty of cars in the parking lot, there was no one in line. I was greeted by someone behind the counter and she took my order quickly. My food also arrived to me just as quickly, I decided to take my breakfast to go, and it was delicious when I arrived at my location.

REVIEW #4:  4 stars  (336 chars)
Not a big fan of BK - I need a little more meat in my burgers than they like to give you. But this place is cool simply because of the soda machine is a freak of nature. Our hotel was not far away (outside the strip) so it was easy to get to. Food was good for BK food service was ok since the place was empty inside every time we went.

REVIEW #5:  3 stars  (750 chars)
i went to burger king not because i am fan, but because when ur hungy, u need sustenance and the nearest food chain is like a taste of heaven. but heaven was not what i found in this place. first thing i did when i got to this place is to check the underside of the table for gum, and holy molly, i cant count how many pieces of gum were stuck in there!!! disgusting! from that moment, everything seems going downhill. i look at my burger, and it looks very delicious. and oh, boy, i was wrong. my burger was rubbery and over cooked!!! fries was oily as hell. and the soda was watered down!!! everything just totally went wrong, and i went home with an empty stomach. well, i guess, the world is conniving to make me go into some weight loss program.

REVIEW #6:  2 stars  (723 chars)
Came here after going to the outlet mall since there's not much of a selection of places to eat there. Just an average fast food burger joint. The service was good. But it was kinda dirty. The tables were filthy. Trash and crumbs. We had to tell the staff to if they could wipe the table we wanted to sit at. And the girl started wiping other tables before ours. Common sense would tell someone to clean the table that the person complained about first. Not last. And they were out of napkins. Bk needs to step it up. Oh yea, I ordered a bk bacon burger. And it had one tiny piece of bacon. No more than a inch long. One bite and there was no more bacon. I guess I'll keep avoiding bk. I should have stuck with my instinct.

REVIEW #7:  2 stars  (835 chars)
Great and upgraded establishment and facilities.glad Burger King is trying to up the anti since McDs started adding a contemporary feel to their establishment. ...  ... However, the current manager here is EXTREMELY RUDE. Treats "his employees" like poorly abused worker bees. After speaking to him kindly and nicely requesting service he got really rude and irate with me like I was some poor criminal trying to steal his hamburgers. I mean I can go to other local establishments to get good and better service but a small suggestion to this manager would be to provide better service and get an attitude check because with all the high competition of local businesses all they really have to show for is their service. Without it, they'd be nothing more than low quality food hidden behind a highly expensive yet worthless face lift.

REVIEW #8:  2 stars  (119 chars)

REVIEW #9:  1 stars  (393 chars)
Breakfast was poor at this newer location. Croissantwich was stale, bun was hard. Employee agrued with me versus just replacing it. No coffee, they had to make it, but it took 10 minutes. Employee said "we have only one coffee maker and it is 30 years old". Coffee was thick and gross. Service overall was slow. I can see why this Burger King was empty at 7:30-8:00 am. Go to another location.

REVIEW #10:  1 stars  (213 chars)
Customer service was pretty bad. Staff was too loud to make an order and the food was sub par. I was hoping for a nice fresh lunch and was very disappointed. The lettuce was brown, patties were rubbery and cold. .

REVIEW #12:  1 stars  (234 chars)
I love Burger King but I would drive five extra miles to avoid this location. I think the government owns this location because they work at DMV speed not In-n-out speed. One double cheese burger with no modifications took 10 minutes.

REVIEW #13:  1 stars  (609 chars)
The facility is really nice with two flat panel tv's playing ESPN.  You would think that I was in heaven.  NOT.  It took 14 minutes to get two dinky BK Burgers.  Then they were barely lukewarm and one tasted like chemicals.  The staff are a bunch of zombies out of a bad B movie.  They have no urgency, they have zero personality and basically think that the customers are an inconvenience.   ... With all of the places to eat, go somewhere else.  So not worth the terrible experience.  The management seemed just as thrilled to be on site too so dont expect if you go and have issues that they will help you.

Not big on flame broiled but we were in the area and needed something to hold us until dinner time. The food is pretty consistent, dry patties, soggy lettuce... My favorite part is the little bit of onion that they have in it lol. ...  ... For the most part, it was pretty clean. It's a pretty small dining area but if you're in and out, I guess it's ok :)

Took the kids here for lunch while we were on our way to the Touch A Truck event a few months ago. ...  ... It's your standard franchise restaurant which seemed to be running smoothly, despite being opened recently. ...  ... One note is that the person at the counter taking the orders struggled to take the order, but that is to be expected with a newly opened store.

Yo, everyone knows about BK.....   but this one was a great experience.  I am not sure if the lady behind the counter was a DRILL SGT.  She ran such a tight ship... there was virtually no wait on a busy lunch hour visit and she made everyone laugh.... very impressive.....

REVIEW #4:  2 stars  (258 chars)

I went to this location at about 9:30 at night. It was one of those double drive thru's and I pulled in the first one, noticing that there was a red mustang in the next order menu, waiting to order. After a full minute (literally, not exaggerrating) I finally said "Hello?" A lady replied "I'll be right with you." I noticed the red car guy still at the next menu board. I waited for five minutes, still, no one took my order.  My patience were gone and I left to the McDonalds two miles down the road. On my way home, from my ten min. trip to McDs. I passed Burger King and spotted the red car guy still waiting to order. This was crazy. They didn't offer and explanation or apology,  just silence. ...   Despite this occasion, previous trips to this location always rendered me unhappy, and this time I decided I'm not ever going back to that location.

This was the worst BK experience I can remember ever having.  It was just me and my 5yr old son.  I ordered a Bk stacker combo meal with no sauce, and a 4 piece chicken nugget kids meal for my kid.  After waiting for about 10 minutes I walked back towards the counter assuming my food should be done any second.  While standing there they called out 2 order #'s that were after mine.  I seen several kids meals going out the drive through window also.  So I stand all the way by the pickup counter waiting for someone to come by so I can ask, and I get ignored for several minutes.  Finally a supervisor person tells me my order is coming up next, so of course I wait a few minutes when they place a tray of food out and call out the #.  Guess what, not my order either.  So the supervisor asks what my order was and I hand him my reciept.  He does not apologize for the wait or anything but turns and yells my order to some cooks.  He then asks me what sauce we want for the kids nuggets, I ask for Ranch and he hands me like 6 ranches, like that will make up for now having to wait like 20 minutes.  Again no apology for the long wait and basically them losing or forgetting my order.  Than when I get the food, it was sloppy, burger patties hanging half way out the side of the bun...just a mess.

This is a nice BK.  The building has been remodeled and looks great.  The inside is pretty and looks very modern.  They have the usual seating as well as a little cove with couches and cushy seats to sit and have a coffee.  The playground area is nice and big.  It is 2 stories with a lot of room for the kiddos to run around in.  There is pretty limited seating for adults though with only 3 tables available.  Another bonus was the new automated soda machine.  I love these machines and the abundance of soda choices.  Yummy!  Overall it was a nice BK as compared to the others I have visited.

REVIEW #4:  4 stars  (771 chars)
While I swore I'd never write up a fast food chain review, I have to give this location a nod, as it had no reviews, and frankly, it deserves the compliment. ...  ... Reason being?  I got very courteous, very polite, very efficient service.  The guy who was behind the drive-thru window this last Monday was as polite as he could be.  I don't know whether it was the result of a competent manager training program, or his momma simply raised him right, but I usually don't expect compliments when I get an average fast food burger.  Nice kid. ...  ... Plus, my order was completely 100% correct, and I simply have to make note of that.  While every experience down the road may not be as favorable or as agreeable as this one was,  you have to give credit where it's due.

Ok, BK, really? Now Im not one of those little food snobs, and Im a cheap beezy so after paying outta my butt for my car here is where I came for a little treat! ...  ... I only came for a ice cream sundae after Savers, and I went through the drive through. Now they recently remodeled this place, and its like stupid the way they put the exit right by the exit onto Lake Mead. You would think they wouldve made the opening big enough to enter AND exit, alas there is a sign to not turn into the drive thru... OK? SOOOOO if youre going to try and enter after leaving Chase, Savers, or any of those places you technically are supposed to go all the way around to enter. I was like wtf? and just went through anyway bc I had already pulled half way in. So I proceed to order my ice creams and the guy was ok, not amazing or super nice just ok. Service was quick but he gave me a dumb look when I asked him for a cup holder for 3 sundaes and a cup of water... hello bro! I dont have 4 cup holders!  ...  ... Anywho ice cream was yummy as usual and service was semi quick, not bad, just a weird drive thru entrance, and a huge slope going down the drive thru.. haha. Ill probs come back, I do love their 1$ sundaes!

This review is based totally on one thing and one thing only. OK. Maybe two things. When you go to Burger King, you know what's coming. I got a Whopper combo. And decided to give the new Chicken Parm a shot. I don't know what they are trying to pass off as marinara, but its not even close to being good. Now for the next complaint. The lady at the window asked if I needed ketchup. Good job on that. Usually you aren't even asked if you want it. My response was yes. A LOT OF KETCHUP, please! So how many do I get? Four. Four! You have to be kidding me! For a Whopper and an order of fries? Tsk tsk tsk.

I was in a hurry and BK was close by. I was so surprised to see that they had brought the "Rodeo Cheeseburger" back! I have been still ordering it after all these years since the "Little Soldiers" gem disappeared from the menu I just had to customize a regular Cheeseburger to do so. It was cheap yummy! ...  ...

Its BK, what can I say?! ...  ... My son and I love coming here on a hot day after the library!! Here its a little hidden, but once you get here its super nice and air conditioned! We've been here a few times and each time its been pretty swell!  ...  ... The wait is usually short bc its not always busy, the cashiers are pretty nice also, except one of the weirdos who told the manager she wasnt going to refill the ice in the machine. ...  ... The prices here are comparable, although I dont usually eat the burgers I do sometimes like the onion rings. What I really come here for, in addition to the kids meals, are the fruit smoothies and sundaes! The ice cream here is seriously sooooooooo yummy! And its only 1$ for a sundae! The mango smoothies are also super yummy and are 2$ and change! ...  ... My son loves the kids meals here, they include your entree but what he loves most is the paper crown attached.  They also usually have some pretty neat childrens toys. ...  ... So we will def continue coming here for the cheap eats, and nice cooled play area!

This BK is right around the corner from my house and job, so I frequent it quite often.

Although, evertime I go they have this generic message asking how my day is and I always respond like a tard- so to save yourself, dont worry about responding! :)

Ahhh, my local BK.  It is like every other BK around and is pretty consistent.  It gets the job done when you are in a rush and don't have time to cook. ...  ... I have to admit, I am here pretty regularly.  It is because:  ...  ... 1. I live around the corner and it is the closest place to my house. ... 2. It is cheap and has ok burgers and chicken sandwiches. ... 3. My kid loves the milkshakes and smoothies they have on the menu.  I love making her happy, so we visit pretty often. ... 4. The play place is pretty fun for the little ones.  It is especially nice when it is so hot in the summer.  It is nice and air conditioned, which us Las Vegans LOVE. ... 5. I may or may not be addicted to the new SatisFries. ...  ... This particular location has just gone through a remodel.  It is now more modern with a coffee house style to it.  The food is still the same, but it is now in a prettier locale. ...  ... So if you want a fast food joint, this one is pretty and pretty good at what they do.

REVIEW #5:  3 stars  (1065 chars)
This is the nearest Burger King near my house, and I really don't go here more often than I should because, well, I don't really fancy fast food places like this. I just happened to drop in here because I had my daughter with me & I wanted her to play at their little indoor playground after we ate lunch (it was getting too hot outside to head to the park).  ...  ... Anyway, I ordered the Angry Whopper combo meal because it looked delicious and it was. I just didn't end up finishing it because it was just too big for me. I guess my eyes were hungrier than my tummy. My daughter got their two chicken strip kids meal with the fries, and she loved it.  ...  ... What really fascinated me about this place was they had that cool Coca-Cola touch-screen vending machine! That was definitely fun to play around with. There were soooo many choices too! I would go back there just to see what else they had! ...  ... Overall, clean establishment, nice staff. It's Burger King, so there wasn't really a "wow" factor this place other than it being, well.. A Burger King.

Having a 14 year old Son means a lot of trips to Fast Food joints and this one is in our neighborhood.  This one is not one of our favorite joints.  The food quality here is sub-par....even by fast food standards.  The Beef never tastes fresh and the Bread seems a little old at times. ...  ... We decided we wouldn't eat here anymore because it's that bad.  There are 1000's of other fast food joints to choose from.

Ahh BK, how lovely. ...  ... This BK is pretty close to my apartment. Its kinda hidden behind trees and such, but its next to Outback Steak House. My son had been asking for one of their crowns so on our way home from the library we stopped in. ...  ... Walking in its nice, it has one of then things to follow so you can stand in a formed line, the menu is big... but the value menu is to the left and a lil small.... great marketing BK! Lol. Today we got a chicken tenders kids meal and a double cheeseburger combo. ...  ... The kids meal was cute, it comes in a box with a crown attached and your choice of chicken tenders, cheeseburger, or regular burger. Plus you get the standard fries and a drink. I got the double cheeseburger meal with the ice cream sundae. At first I was like a little iffy, Im not super into fast food but this one was yummy! The new fries they have are thick and crispy and have a good amount of salt. Now I usually like my stuff salted and this was perfect! I really like the self serve drinks and ketchup, I feel like Im not wasting when I use the ketchup dispenser. I tried all my food and it was delish! I then tried my ice cream and was in love!! ITS SOOO RICH AND CREAMY! For BK this is awesome! I loved it!  ...  ... We found a seat in the play place which was pretty large and had a ton of seats... most of all it was CLEAN! Yay! My son enjoyed himself very much in there! It doesnt get too crowded when theres a lot of children and its temp is cool in there! ...  ... The only gripe I had is one of the workers was being a beezy bc the manager asked her to refill the ice machine... she was totally not having it! All in all this place is A-OK with me!

Everyone is really nice here. The only issue I have is that they don't understand my order and when I get my food, I have missing items. But overall, they are still really nice.

REVIEW #6:  4 stars  (95 chars)
For a fast food chain, cheap and Sometimes semi fast food, this particular BK isn't too shabby.

REVIEW #7:  4 stars  (482 chars)
I know it's weird reviewing Burger King but I just had to let people know about my experience. The staff at this place are pretty amazing for a fast food joint. I usually eat at in n out or smash burger but I was at a loose end. The burger was fine as were the fries which would normally be a 3 star but I had an emergency, needed a charger for my phone. Of course nobody has one but they all scrambled and came back with a charger from a neighboring business- so kudos to the team.

REVIEW #8:  4 stars  (588 chars)
Recently renovated this is my favorite Bk. Love the pub style seating and the large booths that are modern looking. The two big tvs keep me entertained while eating, which means I can enjoy my soccer game while my little one plays in the play area. ...  ... Customer service is really good. They are fast and have never made a mistaken on my order.  ...  ... Love their whopper, Cinnabon bites and the chicken nuggets (which right now are 10 for $1.50)  ...  ... When crowns are available they give them with the kids meal. Which my daughter likes more than a toy. Princess in the making.

This is a great Burger King with a really nice fresh remodel. Extremely friendly servers always. Food is always good hot and consistent!

REVIEW #10:  3 stars  (578 chars)
I haven't been in since they've done the remodel, but my experiences here have been pretty average. Food was just like every other BK, the workers have generally been moderately helpful. The play area is great; my 3-year old loves it. I just went through the drive thru last night and got a brownie sundae. It was delicious, even though the brownie was hard- there was no way I could cut through it with my spoon. I ended up just picking the brownie up and chowing down. It's a good thing I was at home and not in public, because that was not an especially polite way to eat it.

REVIEW #11:  3 stars  (240 chars)
I still enjoy a whopper once in a while so I can say I am a fan of Burger King; however, I try to avoid some fast food joints on a daily basis so I don't make my stomach too big. I also still enjoy their chicken nuggets and chocolate shakes

REVIEW #12:  2 stars  (86 chars)
Food was Ok... Service not very good , No napkin, fork, or offered Ketchup for fries..

REVIEW #13:  1 stars  (869 chars)
This is the worst BK in the valley. Seriously, drive two miles over to go to the Charleston/215 one or the Town Center/Summerlin Parkway location.  ...  ... I went to this location 4 times before giving up and driving farther. Cold fries (that you wait 10 minutes for), wrong items (twice we received either two Cokes or two Diet Cokes when we order one of each), items incorrectly made, missing items, and what was best, was when they didn't even know what went into the Family Meal when it was out for a limited time. The cashier did not believe me when I said it was supposed to come with a toy, nor did the other cashier, until they finally got a manager out of t he back who laughed and said she guesses she better train out on the new menu item.  ...  ... Drive the extra 5 minutes, you'll make it up in speed of service and not having to go back to get it fixed.

Ah, Burger King on the base - because there aren't many other options. ...  ... Stopped here on a few occassions, typically when I'm on base with family. BK is not high on my list of places I like to patron on the regular, but it will do in certain cases. ...  ... Perks - No tax. Shares dining room with Popeyes. Other customers are nice. Dining room well kept and clean. ...  ... Cons - Employees seem... A little out of it sometimes? On a recent trip the cheese on my Whopper wasn't even melted. Prep of food could use improvement. ...  ... Why go? You're on base and it's convenient. But honestly I'd pick getting sandwiches or sushi at the commissary over BK 99.9% of the time.

REVIEW #2:  3 stars  (280 chars)
Pretty average BK. It shares a dining room with Popeyes so you'll have decent variety in the building.  The trash cans are always turned facing the walls for some reason, and the fountain drink machines don't always function, but overall it's not much different than any other BK.

Very happy with the drive thru person. I believe his name was Edgar . He was very nice and polite even though it was super busy at around 7 this morning. He cleaned my caramel frap off before he gave it to me and told me to have a great day as he gave me my straw.

REVIEW #2:  2 stars  (1108 chars)
Fast food in general isn't good or healthy for you at all. I'm sure folks turn to fast food just for the fact that it's fast and easy to get something when you're on the go, but I would honestly drink a gallon of water before I scarf down fast food. But when I don't have that gallon of water handy, I succumb to the temptation :/ ...  ... I'm a Whopper fan. I don't what's in it that draws me to it, but I like it. I don't know if folks remember the Rodeo Burger, but I took a liking to that too. And then, the inevitable happens to the not-so-popular burger ideas-- they kick the can and disappear from the menu. I like the Chicken Sandwich also. NO MAYO! I like how they decided to not charge you extra when you want onion rings instead of fries. ...  ... This Burger King is open early and I snagged breakfast before heading off to work a few times. Try the Sausage Biscuit (Do not call them McAnything. They hate that! Hahaha!) with strawberry jam on it! Taste like a sweet hearty grease ball! :P ...  ... I'll come back when I feel like a cheat day or something. Or feeling lazy to get anything better.

REVIEW #3:  1 stars  (298 chars)
Quick but bad service. My nuggets were cold and they would only give me 1 BBQ sauce for a 20 piece. When I asked for 2 more sauces the said .10 cents each. I asked how much ketchup was (joking) the chick said "IDK" let me ask, and actually asked the manager. I was making a scarcastic joke/ remark.

RANT: ...  ... Madison, get more fast food.   ...  ... I don't know how all these kids got through undergrad without a steady supply of fast food places.  My college town was saturated with them.  And it wasn't like an obesity epidemic had been unleashed in the student ghetto. ...  ... I guess if you're a certain type, you'd think it's great that Madison forces kids to stay off the big mac meal plan.  I guess it probably is.  But it's certainly a hell of a lot less fucking fun.  Responsibility comes on at an earlier age for badgers.  It's got to when the weather conspires to kill you 3/4ths of the year.

REVIEW #2:  3 stars  (530 chars)
They recently remodeled and it looks really nice inside. They added TVs and all of there registers actually work now (yay!) They hired some new people as well which seems to really be helping this place out.. it still takes forever to get your order  if there busy but at least it's only when there busy because before the new additions to the staff came along I use to go when it was almost completely dead and it would take 15 minutes for me to get my food, so I can tell that there trying but they still have a LONG ways to go.

REVIEW #3:  2 stars  (480 chars)
Great update to your facility, it needed it. As I am used to only getting either my fries hot or my sandwich hot, generally neither at the same time. I was really dissatisfied that not one was hot enough to eat. I physically left my whole meal and tray on the table and walked out. No amount of ketchup could make me eat it.  ...  ... Hope they find a great staff so they can warrant spending the money on the upgrade.  ...  ... I will probably not go back to this location again.

REVIEW #5:  1 stars  (903 chars)
I know I shouldn't expect much from BK, but this location is ridiculous.  You really shouldn't even THINK of going here during lunch.  They have ONE cash register at the front of the store.  Not just one OPEN register...  they only have one register, usually being operated by the slowest person they employ. ...  ... The drive-through is no better.  Cars are backed up into the next parking lot. ...  ... If you insist on trying to eat there, I would suggest you go inside to eat, that way, when they invariably get your order wrong, you can throw it directly at them.  If you get drive-through you will end up like me, paying for a double cheeseburger only to get back to your desk and find out that they totally screwed you and only gave you a single.  You will then slam your fists on your desk and start swearing and get called into your boss' office...  at least that's what happened with me. YMMV

REVIEW #6:  1 stars  (4089 chars)
Not only the worst BK franchise I've ever been to... but probably the worst-managed restaurant franchise I've ever encountered. It's a like a bad (bad) movie... ...  ... OPEN ON two guys and a girl in a GREEN SOUL ordering drive through from Burger King on East Wash. They are hungry, but their order is easy. Just three burgers, twp fries, and one drink. ...  ... AUDIO OVER (BK INTERCOM VOICE, with a bored lackluster air): "Okay, drive up to the window." ...  ... The CAR pulls up behind two other cars waiting for their orders. And they wait. And wait. And wait. Six minutes later, the first car finally gets their food and drives off. ...  ... The CARS pull up closer. And they wait. And wait. And wait. ...  ... A few minutes later, two uniformed BURGER KING EMPLOYEES, one man and one woman, exit the restaurant. They hang out in by the waiting CARS in front of the restaurant. Chatting for a few minutes, then amble back into the restaurant. ...  ... The CARS continue to wait. Minutes more pass. ...  ... Two more BURGER KIND EMPLOYEES, two women, exit the store with a TODDLER in tow, but they are carrying huge bags of BK food. ...  ... The DRIVER of the GREEN SOUL, "This is ridiculous, we've been waiting over 10 minutes, I'm getting out of here.  Mickey D's is right over there.... Wait... Hey, are those BK employees carrying out FOOD?!" ...  ... BURGER KING EMPLOYEE #1, puts up her arm carrying a huge bag of TAKEOUT and uses her body to physically block the GREEN SOUL from leaving. The TODDLER wanders aimlessly and dangerously around the parking lot. ...  ... The CAR in front of the GREEN SOUL receives their order finally, and drives off. The CAR waiting for food behind the SOUL peels out of line, barely missing the wandering TODDLER. ...  ... BURGER KING EMPLOYEE #1 (shouting at the CASHIER through the window): "How long have these nice people been waiting?!  ...  ... CASHIER (searching for the order ticket): "Um... 15 minutes." ...  ... BK EMPLOYEE #1 (shouting): "Well, give them two free ice creams for making them wait so long!" ...  ... SOUL PASSENGER #1 (quietly): "It's okay, we just want the food we ordered.... And, besides, there are three of us. Not two." ...  ... BK EMPLOYEE (angrily shouting through the cashier window): "Just get them some ice cream... they were almost going to leave, you guys are so slow. Lucky I stopped them. You're the manager. Manage!" ...  ... A few more minutes pass. One single ICE CREAM is passed through the window to the waiting passengers. Then, finally, a BAG with the burgers and fries arrives. The GREEN SOUL drives off down East Wash. Watching carefully to be sure the wandering TODDLER isn't in the way. ...  ... SOUL PASSENGER takes a bite out of his burger, and spits it out into a napkin: "Oh my god! How in the hell did they ruin a Whopper, for chrissakes!?  ...  ... SOUL DRIVER: What's wrong with it? ...  ... SOUL PASSENGER #1: "It's cold. And I mean cold. It doesn't taste like meat. It's just rubbery and tasteless... and where's the char-broiled taste? Did they forget to add it? The cheese is in no way melted. There's a wilted mass of white lettuce core shoved in the middle, like a bad surprise. The bun crusty and stale.... do I need to go on--? ...  ... SOUL PASSENGER #2, sampling a french fry: "And my fries are soggy and cold, too.... and no ketchup packets in the bag. And my bun's stale, too!" ...  ... SOUL DRIVER starts to laugh: "that was so bad, I expected cameras to come out of the door next, 'smile, you're on candid camera!" ...  ... SOUL PASSENGER #1: "Or 'Punked." ...  ... SOUL PASSENGER #2: "We were punked, all right. Let's ditch this sorry excuse for food and order Culver's... the food is always hot and delicious there. And the staff is nice and helpful, too. ...  ... The GREEN SOUL exits East Wash, and on the way into CULVER'S, PASSENGER #1 exits the vehicle, and throws the BK bags of food away in the CULVER'S garbage can.  ...  ... SOUL PASSENGER #2 getting back into the car: "Never again." ...  ... SOUL PASSENGER #1 and SOUL DRIVER: "Never again!" ...  ... THE END.

REVIEW #7:  1 stars  (740 chars)
This is the worst fast food franchise in town. ...  ... The drive through is slow.  The food is inconsistent.  The staff are ambivalent. ...  ... Averaging over a minute per vehicle in the drive through isn't "fast".  Serving burgers with mere samples of the veggies in the marketing material demonstrates poor attention to detail, if not inventory management problems.   ...  ... They can't even consistently pack bags so that the fries stay in their containers.  Why bother with the containers at all if the fries are just going to be scattered throughout the bag? ...  ... The franchises in Sun Prairie and De Forest remain "east side" options, but I'm giving up on this location.  Four chances in two years, and they never got it right.

REVIEW #8:  1 stars  (860 chars)
Thought I would stop at drive thru for quick lunch, twenty minute later with two cars in front of me waiting on there order i decided to leave. Felt bad for the cars in front of me that had already had paid for their food. When I left the car behind me followed as well.  I stopped here a couple of months ago and ordered inside and the wait was probabley just as long but they had money so I waited. I saw that they had remodeled and I hoped the found some new management and employees. The concept of taking one order, then making that order before taking or starting another order is not the concept of the way a fast food restraunt should be run. Change the management and improve service, clean the inside and you might have a viable operation.  The McDonalds down the block does not suffer from this poor management, just suffers from the McDonalds food.

REVIEW #9:  1 stars  (334 chars)
We have gone here in the past year four times and they are always out of ice cream. It doesn't matter the time of day. This last week we went to get ice cream and food. Ordered chicken tenders they were out. OK can we have four cheeseburgers no we are out of buns. Well what can we get, whatever you want. We just left after all that.

REVIEW #10:  1 stars  (478 chars)
Worst BK I've ever been to. That may not sound so serious considering its a fast food place but its terrible even by fast food standards. Orders take at least 10 minutes to complete and 25 percent of the time they come out wrong. I don't know how but their burgers are the worst, dry and tasteless. Aren't these food products supposed to be foolproof? I thought the renovation would've brought new employees and better service but this shiny apple is rotten inside. Never again.

For fast food this place is doing a lot of things right.  They have very good tasting burgers that are hot.  Their fries are done very well and have always been nice and hot.   And... just yesterday they actually looked me in the face, smiled and thanked me in a professional manner for my purchase!  Wow.   That was a first for me at a fast food restaurant.  Sure would like to see more of this.  Thanks Burger King!

I have been pleased with my last few trips to Burger King. In both the drive thru and inside dining,  the staff have been very pleasant, helpful, and provide great customer service. The food was cooked well, tasted good, and presentation of food was good (for a fast food restaurant. ) It is difficult for me to give a fast food restaurant five stars (needs to go beyond my expectations), but this location is pretty close.

REVIEW #3:  4 stars  (350 chars)
I must say with the amount of business this Burger King does it has always been accurate, fast and declicious. ...  ... They have the best chicken sandwich (The Original) in town. ...  ... I would have given 5 stars but, the trash can in the drive thru when you are exiting is always full and overflowing.  Who wants to drive over trash?  Not me.....

REVIEW #4:  3 stars  (377 chars)
They do a good job here but they changed their burger recipe.   The Steakhouse burger was excellent.  No longer served.  Then they went to a modified burger that was the XT I think.  It was ok but not as good.  Now they have a California burger or something like that and it is a little less appealing.   Not our thing anymore. ... The fries are usually very good and very hot.

REVIEW #5:  1 stars  (544 chars)
Burger King scews themself again!  Who is running this franchise?  They don't know what they are doing.  What I am referring to is that they took their best new burgers off their menu and went back to the old Whopper and basic blah.  What the heck!?  They got us back with their angus and Texas burgers and now they don't carry those anymore.   ... Staff is good and the store is clean and the fries are good.   This place is only good for some fries so why go here.  I suggest Wendy's or for something different Popeye's if you want fast food.

22 minutes to get my order. Terrible service! I was the only one in the store when I placed my order although there were 3 cars in drivethru. Not acceptable!

I don't know what it is about this place, but they are slooooooooow. The food is adequate (please don't lecture me about fast food, why are you even reading this review?), but sitting at the drive-in will shorten your life. Or maybe just feel like it.  ...  ... I prefer some of their stuff to McDonald's (yes, I'm very discerning) but just cannot abide the wait.

It's a Burger King.  My expectations were not that high.  However, they are unbearably slow, and the dining area is usually pretty dirty.  The food is mediocre, even for fast foot's low standards.  The staff usually acts like you're ruining their day for showing up.

Have been there several times and it's always super slow. It had been months since we had gone there so today we went there and the girl at the counter just finished a counter order, saw us, and went to drive through. We stood there for 15 minutes waiting for somebody to take our order. Fed up, we left and went to Culver's.

Having won a free small frapee from the "Family Food" giveaway at another Burger King, I decided to go inside the Sun Prairie location to cash it in. This was after I waited for almost twenty minutes at the drive-through, even after the order taker told me she'd be with me in, "just a second." Inside the lobby, I was met by a scene of dirty tables, slow service, and a floor littered with a surprising ammount of plastic gloves. When I finally made it to the counter, I was amazed to learn that it is somehow possible to take my order without saying a single word to me, and then simply walking away without even handing me a reciept. Perhaps it was this same top-notch service and accuracy that caused another customer there to have to come back not once, not twice, but THREE times because they made his food wrong. At this point, my instincts said to leave, but my honor required that I stick with it to the bitter end. But when I finally got the free frapee, I was saddened to say that it was not worth the wait. If you value your ability to eat at Burger King more than your time, I would suggest staying in your car at this location and living in blissful ignorance. As for me, it'll be a while before I have it my way again.

REVIEW #7:  1 stars  (323 chars)
I have given this burger king a chance MANY times... But they are BY FAR the slowest burger king I have EVER been to... Even if they have no customers inside, and you go through the empty drive through, they will STILL make you pull forward and wait for your meal, one time it was over a half hour! Absolutely unreasonable.

REVIEW #8:  1 stars  (1272 chars)
I went through the drive through, with about 4 cars ahead of me. After placing my order, it took about 15 minutes just to get to the window, where I then waited 28 minutes being ignored! I know the exact time because I looked at the time stamp on my receipt! There were at least three cars waiting behind me too! I finally got the attention of the lady inside to see what the problem was, and I was just told that they are "short staffed" and they make the food fresh to order, Which I guess means they go out back and wait for the chickens to mature, slaughter them, and THEN make the nuggets! I asked for a manager, when she finally showed up, I was not given an apology, just the same story of being short staffed. At this point I had asked to just have my money back so that I could go elsewhere (still no food) and I was told by said manager that she doesn't know how to do that....so I waited....and finally (28 minutes later) got my food, which was cold, and my milkshake had long since melted. Waste of my time and money! ...  ... I did get a phone number also for what I was told the general manager, called, it was a cell phone with no name on the voicemail, left a message anyway, no return call. ...  ... I won't ever be back, and I don't think they even care!

I would give this BK a -1 star if I could. They just recently renovated their building, cool, looks nice. I've stopped going to this location, it is the worst in fast food. Once i was told in the drive-thru that they were out of meat, but had chicken or fish. LOL Seriously! The king of burgers out of meat!?!?!? The wait in the drive-thru is painfully SLOW! I once ordered, waited for like 10-15 minutes, got fed up and left. Drove over to Wendy's, got my food and drove past BK on the way home. The truck i was behind in the drive-thru was still in the same spot! Crazy.  ...  ... This BK NEEDS better management and training for the employees. They just don't seem to care. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!

Remember when Burger King was actually somewhat decent?  Pepperidge Farm remembers... ...  ... I have dined with the King many a time across this fine land.  I have watched their slow decline with sadness over the last thirty years.  At one point, they actually challenged the Clown for burger superiority, but now, they're a weak shadow on the market, barely a player... ...  ... ...and the BK at this location is a perfect example of why. ...  ... EVERYTHING at this BK takes ten minutes.  Doesn't matter what you order, be prepared to wait. ...  ... It's always dirty.  When I was a kid and worked at the Clown, we were always cleaning.  There was usually one or two people on any shift whose sole job was to keep the lobby clean.  This place is a hole. ...  ... Why does the food taste weird?  If I want BK, I actually make the drive to Deforest, rather than eat at this location, which is actually a stone's throw from my house.  The food here tastes bad, bleachy, and wrong.  What are they doing to the food? ...  ... Fix thyself, King, and maybe I'll return.  Until then, I will take my cheap, poorly constructed eats elsewhere.

REVIEW #12:  1 stars  (349 chars)
This place is slow beyond belief. How do they stay in business? I waited 15 min for my order which was wrong and cold. I got the excuse "were short staffed". There were two cars in line and no one in the dining area. How much staff do you need for two customers? I think they laugh about how bad they are as workers. Because they could care less....

REVIEW #13:  1 stars  (775 chars)
Unless you like being ignored, Avoid, Avoid, Avoid! Stopped in for lunch today and the place was pretty much empty. There was a lady waiting at the counter for her order, two gentlemen who already had their order and were seated and eating. There was one worker for the front counter and the drive thru and 2 or 3 workers in the back. Waited over 10 minutes for someone to take my order and wasn't even acknowledged in that time. One of the guys came up front to bag drive thru orders, wiped the sweat off his face with a napkin, crumpled it up, tossed it in the trash and then scooped up fries without washing his hands. At that point I walked out and went to Culvers where I ordered and got my food in less time than I spent waiting to order here.  Not even worth one star!

First of all, it's Wendy's, so obviously it's fast food. And it's in a pilot gas station stop so tons of big rigs. But the customer service there is phenomenal. The gentleman in the afternoon, I think his name is Sam, walks around and asks how is your day going and if he can refill your drink. But he sounds so honest when he asks how your doing. There is another gentleman At the cashier, can't remember his name but he remember me After one visit And was very kind and helpful. Good job Wendy's team and management.

I swung by one evening on my way who knows where (I drive big rigs). You guys were busy, pretty DAMN busy!! The store was clean and organised just the same! a nice thing to see considering some of the dining tragedies i get to see in my profession. You had 1 person that stood out of the group of hard working employees. Her name was Alyssa, and she kicked many butts! She was kind, thorough and proficient. She took my order and was clearly in a "zone". like a well oiled cog, she moved fluidly through the madness and still had the poise to ask if i needed extra napkins! To you Alyssa I say "Bravo"!! I look forward to going there again!

The food here is what I'd expect from a Wendy's, but don't go into the dining room if you're in a hurry. They obviously give the drive-thru top priority and you can wait upwards of 15 minutes for your food. The dining room was clean and the people were friendly. I'll go back, but I'll be staying in my car.

Came through the drive thru around 230pm. There was no line and I was helped right away. I ordered a jr bacon cheeseburger, crispy chicken sandwich, and a small coke. The total was under 4 bucks! This is what I normally order from Wendy's, so I'm excited to say that this was one of the better Wendy's! It was fast warm and fresh. The bun was soft and fluffy, the bacon crisp, the chicken crisp outside with moist interior. I was very impressed!!

This was actually considered my second time eating out at Wendy's at this location in particular everything was completely satisfactory and fine up until I had went up to the counter and the woman behind the cashier was a woman by the name Lupe. I remembered I had ate there before it was so much better one year ago. Customer service was much more professional and the only good thing about this place is their quality of food, which I will rate this 2 out of 5 stars.  ... The woman behind the cashier was pretty damned rude and seemed agitated enough that she did not even want to be there, I was confused in regards to the menu due to the lack of being there in such a long time and she actually exasperated a couple of times and became even more irritable after apparently to her I wasn't fast enough to make up my mind. Dave Thomas would be rolling in his grave to see how the low paying scum bags treats those of us who keeps them in business. They have officially lost my business that is for sure, typically I am used to going to more professional and higher quality foods. ...  ... It's understandable that inside of our society right now everyone is agitated about the Economy and we're at a crisis situation however it's no one else fault not considering the everyday people are concerned. They should probably read the Bible once and learn the correct way to treating other people. I am not condemning the entire employees but there are some good people working there, just some rotten ones (will always slip in one way or another)  ...  ... Sign you're resignation and provide you're place for someone else who actually deserves the job and someone else will just fill in the space in between. That seriously just made me feel agitated, Maybe they need to take some advice from me

The drive-up service is horrible! They ask you to pull around because they are "out of fries" (every time REALLY?) and they give your food to the wrong people! Wendy's used to be good, but their service is terrible now. DON"T pull out to the parking lot or you are asking for problems!

Sometimes I work in the area and this is really convenient. There are not many fast food places along Carefree Highway, and this Wendy's is new and clean.  ... I've gone inside and through the drivethru, and my order has been made quick and fresh each time. The restroom was clean, which is always a big plus. ...  ... Wendy's in general seems to be keeping up with the times, having better menu choices both health wise and price wise. I wouldn't drive out of my way to go here, but I have had no reason to seek a quick bite to eat elsewhere.

REVIEW #2:  1 stars  (238 chars)
I've never written a review on Yelp before so it really says something about how annoyed I am right now. They missed something on my order and when I went back to the window, they saw me, turned away, and ignored me. I'll never come back.

Worst Wendy's I've been to in years.  Slow, poor service.  They couldn't make up their mind at the end of breakfast hours how many people would be allowed to get their breakfast orders, and who would be forced to change orders to lunch.  Total incompetence here.

It's a pretty good Wendy's. I came here while my oil is getting changed at Walmart and was craving a baked potato. I also got a jr bacon cheeseburger off the value menu. Cheap filling and tastes good. ...  ... The store is clean and one of the workers brought a missing item they ordered to the table next to me, instead of yelling from the counter and all the employees were smiling. I think that's a great indication of a great restaurant even if it is fast food.

Wendy's food should be about the same regardless of location. This review is not about the food, but the service. ...  ... I stopped here today on my way to Rocker World. Wow, what a mistake. The food was fine, but I've never seen slower fast food service in my life. I waited 10 minutes in line with 2 other orders in front of me and another 10 minutes for the food.  ...  ... I'm still deciding if the new fries with sea salt are as good as the previous fries..... ...  ... Unless you have lots of time, you may want to hit another location.

Rude workers and barely any toppings on my burgers ever! I go shopping and want a quick burger fix but every time I come to this location it's the same thing. Idk why I keep coming back! Geeze on me! I even debate on del taco but noooo I choose Wendy's and the same thing every time! Take my $20 and screw me over! Smashed burgers, no toppings and practically throw my food at me! How rude! And when I ask for salt every time I get rolling eyes! Shame on you!

I couldn't believe it -- I had breakfast at this location not long ago and it was great ( as far as fast food is concerned) however last Friday after helping our Son move all day long we went to this Wendy's for a late dinner -- Like 8:30P -- We had a couple burgers and fries. A couple of the new Ciabatta Bacon Cheeseburgers== The bread on the Ciabatta was so stale the top of the bun cracked when touched-- The meat patties on the burgers were luke warm and basically tasteless-- I found out why-- the kids working the place had pre-cooked a whole stack of patties on the grill and were using those to make the sandwiches-- BLAH-- One f the push button soda machines was putting our nothing but carbonated water-- We told them== they replied that they knew it and instructed us to use the other machine--( no sign -- no apology)- ... We don't know if it was the young group running the place or was I close to closing ?? What we do know is it will be a long time before we return-- Shameful

REVIEW #5:  1 stars  (551 chars)
I have gave this particular Wendy's location multiple opportunities and they have yet to get one order correct. I even wrote corporate and never received a response. If you order grilled chicken it will be breaded. If you order unsweet iced tea it will be sweet. I actually considered ordering the wrong thing to see if I can get what I really want... Getting your preferred condiments is absolutely beyond this group of folks. It is really too bad this location is very near our home but we will not be back.  I will say the location is always clean.

REVIEW #6:  1 stars  (443 chars)
If I could give this place less than 1 star I would!  The drive thru service here is totally ignorant. All they have to do is read the screen and put the right food in the bag, in my case put the right amount of food. I've been here 3 times and every single time they have forgotten something. This is my first review and last from this place. Go down the road and get your orders right!!! ...  ... This management here is ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE.

While in Sedona, AZ, we stopped at Wendys and two of us ordered the Ciabatta Bacon Cheeseburger; it was awesome. Soooo, 6 days later while close to home I decided to stop at the local Wendys, ordered the same Ciabatta Bacon Cheesburger to split between 2 people. I was highly disappointed. Didn't look or taste like the first one -- half the size and no taste. I will probably go as far as to stop to talk to the manager sometime in the near future.

REVIEW #2:  5 stars  (1730 chars)
With $1.00, I can either get 4 gum balls from the gum ball machine at the mall, or choose an item from the plethora found on Wendy's value menu.  I rarely choose the gum balls.  I give Wendy's 5 stars because in my opinion it is everything you could ask for in a fast food joint: Value, friendliness, and most importantly, speed.  I like to play a game called 'How many seconds from the time I finish placing my order until the time I have my order in hand and am driving away?'.  Today it was 24 seconds - now that's fast food!  They are so quick when taking the order, charging at the first window, and delivering your food to you at the second.  And that was around the time of the lunch hour rush.  My favorite game, however, is called 'Don't come to a complete stop when picking up my food'.  Since they usually have my order hanging out the window before I even get there, I can just roll right through, grab my food while still in motion, and be on my way (With a "Thank you" of course).  This location usually has hot girls working there too.  Did I mention that the girls at both windows said "have a good day!"?.  Well now I did.  In fact, the second one even asked me how I was doing, and while I know their bosses tell them to say those things, my friends at Wendy's almost always sound more genuine than at other places. Many times I get the mandarin chicken salad, which is amazing, but today I got a jr bacon cheeseburger, a crispy chicken sandwich, and a frosty.   I never expect gourmet from Wendy's, especially from the dollar menu, but it's good food and definitely worth it, especially the decadent frosty.  The only complaint I would have is that the first-window girl was not hot like the second-window girl.

REVIEW #3:  2 stars  (420 chars)
Ew. ...  ... Wendy's used to be my favorite fast food restaurant.  WTF happened to their hamburgers?  They taste like beef-flavored mud with condiments now.  Their fries are terrible too as of late. ...  ... What's not terrible is their service.  This is the fastest service and delivery of food that I have ever seen from a fast food joint.  Five stars for service.  Unfortunately, I cannot rate by service alone.  Yuk.

REVIEW #4:  2 stars  (476 chars)
Well the new pretzel burger is decent. Service was ok-you can only get so much enthusiasm out of minimal wage workers, lol. Food wise, everything is way to salty for me. Its like licking a salt lick, I know the cows back home would love the extra flavor of this place! Fries where way to salty for me & you can taste it in the burger. Its been a decade since I visited a Wendy's & if my Bf doesn't sucker me into another trip I'm sure I can go another decade & not bat an eye.

I normally do not do a review for a chained fast food place, the food on the menu is the same as it is in California, Nevada, Arizona, and where ever I might be, but I have to say, this place deservers my review! ...  ... My prego daughter was craving their French fries and Frosty, and Wendys is just walking distance from my house, so off we went, now up until about 3 weeks ago this Wendy's was my number 1 Wendys to avoid, the staff was horrible, the placed just looked tore up, but in the middle of Aug I noticed that they shut Wendys down, and I was like WOOO HOOO someone else thought it was crap, and then I saw they were remodeling it, my hopes were small. ...  ... Then I heard that they let go of the staff, and that right there was an improvement and then they opened back up about 3 weeks ago, now my daughter has already been back, she was going through withdrawals from the Frosty and she kept telling me mom its nice, and the staff is good. ...  ... Well let me tell you, this isn't your normal Wendys anymore, I think Dave Thomas would be proud of this place! It's classy and modern.  Good job Wendys!  Digging the new soda machines, love the many choices for Sprite!  ... S/n the staff last night was watching me like a hawk when I was taking pictures, guess they are not used to crazy picture taking Yelpers....and even free WifI!

This place was super disgusting before the remodel so we avoided. Now it looks good but 3 out of the last 5 times through the drive thru I've ended up with missing items when I get home. Guess I never learn. Just don't get fancy with your order like a substitution and you might be OK.

Alright, I don't usually do reviews for these types of fast food restaurants because they usually speak for themselves.  Medium quality food with somewhat expensive prices. So this might be the only one I'll do. ...  ... Anyways, I used to dislike Wendy's growing up.  Was probably one of my least favorite fast food places.  Probably 2 years ago I retried this location (before the remodeling) and I was impressed.  They seemed to overhaul the quality of the food so that it was actually enjoyable.  So I went here probably 4 more times before they changed the building around. ...  ... So now they decide to fancy up the building just like all the McDonalds all around town.  I walk in and the place looks great for a fast food restaurant.  Open, spacious, really clean and the staff were nicer than usual, and yes, they kept the Coca-Cola freestyle machine (every restaurant should have these things!). ...  ... The food (yes a little pricey, it is a fast food restaurant) was as great as I remember, or hell, maybe even a little better.  Wendy's is probably my favorite fast food chain now because places like Burger King and Arby's seem to want to go downhill. This location is the best one I've been too and it's gotten better.  Check it out

This place went through a complete transformation! I have been coming to this Wendy's for 7 years and I couldn't believe my eyes when I walked in today. Saying they  remodeled is an understatement. The layout is completely different. The ordering process is much easier since the person taking the order is no longer the one fulfilling the order. Much faster and the food is good too!

I eat breakfast here at least once a week, and they mess my order up at least once a week. It gets old to have your hot coffee so cold that you can drink it like a soda, no bacon on a bacon sandwich, items completely missing or incorrect items given. If there were a Wendy's closer, this one would be out of business. The staff here should be retrained or fired, but judging by the fact that the manager is the one working the drive thru every morning messing up the orders, perhaps its the later.

Please save yourself the time, money and stress and do not go to this Wendy's. We first went to this place just after it was built and the service SUCKED. Cold food, SLOW employees, terrible service, they don't know which way is up for ordering anything, constantly mess up orders, they just don't know what's what. And, it wasn't just this one time. Oh no. Maybe we're the stupid ones? We've still gone to this Wendys for YEARS. Why? I can't answer that. We know it's going to be terrible all around every time. Just recently, I was there and 3/4 of the employees were sitting on the patio outside talking and smoking. My guess is they weren't on break either. Probably five or six of them, while one or two were inside. None of them cared anyway. What's it matter... ... They have that many people and they still can't get anything right?  ...  ... One day, I was just fed up with this place and went to go look for comment slip to fill out (not like they would read it anyway) or some kind of person who "runs" this sorry joint. No manager that I could find, and the comment slip box was empty. I will complain corporately about this Wendy's. It's almost as if they PURPOSELY hire bad, careless slow workers to work in this place. It's never the same employee every time you go. Frankly, they just do not give a hoot. At least you can sit in the corner away from the chaos and melt away your thoughts about the bad service while realizing your meal is cold, order is wrong and the fries are soggy while enjoying blaring loud Spongebob.

They get 3 stars because of their food. It's usually right on and tastes really good. ...  ... Otherwise, they would get 2 stars because of their service. Wendy's is the only fast food place I've seen that has the same person take your order and fill your order. Normally someone takes it and there are people back in the kitchen filling it so that the line keeps moving. Not here. The person takes your order and then has to run around collecting your drink, your food, whatever else - keeping everyone waiting behind you in line instead of getting the next order fired up for the kitchen. ...  ... So frustrating. Go here when you're not in a rush. Or use the drive through. For some reason that seems to move faster.

I had really bad customer service tonight. I hate when I'm treated rudely. My husband and I went to order at the drive through but were unsure what we wanted and asked to give us a moment. Right when we were about to order she rudely says "are you going to order or not" no one was behind us, it's 10 at night so the dining room is closed. I've worked in customer service and this appalled me. No matter how you feel about the customer you always smile and test with respect. Clearly they need some staff training on customer service.

On 11-19-10 @ 1:49 PM, I ordered a single hamburger with a bowl of chili. ... The girl turned the chili pot up on its side to get only a half bowl. Then a guy came over and scraped a little more out of the pot, charged me $5.32 and gave it to me. ... I ate the hamburger while reading some lit up sign exclaiming that FRESH IS BEST. Then took a spoon of chili and spit it out. I told the girl of the problem and she said she has more chili on the stove and did I want some. No way and I left. I called the number on the receipt to complain and some guy did not want to talk and told me to call the 800 # on the receipt. I told him there was no #. I told him--I will handle this a different way and here it is--I AM A YELPER! ... I told my wife about it and when I mentioned the location, she told me she hates that place and does not go there. And as you can see, NEITHER WILL I. ...  ... BOB STEPHENS ...  ... However, most Wendy's are good places to eat.

Simply not acceptable. I drove through last night and the kid working the drive thru was too busy "rapping" about his "hustle" to a.) get my order right, and b.) give me my change. The Frosty I ordered was completely melted and might as well have been a lukewarm chocolate milk. This is quite possibly the worst Wendy's location in the area, the service here is consistently awful.

REVIEW #9:  1 stars  (660 chars)
Yeah, I have to agree, this place is consistently bad. Because I live so close to this location, I've gone here a few times, usually in the late evening, but I vow no more! The drive-thru is run by a bunch of rapping-gangsta teenagers who curse freely when they "mistakenly" leave their microphone on, come-on to you sexually when you drive up to pay, and serve you food that has been sitting under the heat lamp for too long. I've been served a salad with barely any toppings that are supposed to come with the salad, a burger that was room-temperature at best, and I always feel like I need a shower after conversing with the "slick-talkin' " drive-thru boy.

I like to get a chocolate Frosty and a Double Stack when I go to Wendy's. I previously wrote a negative review based on my experiences with one not-so-friendly employee. Most of the people that work there are friendly and do a great job, so I changed review from two to four stars. I need to cut back on the large chocolate Frosty as it has about 960 calories. However, it also has 20 grams of yummynous.

I have be to Wendy's several times. I have to say the cashier should just focus on the people in line and let the other people put the foods on the trays.

One of the closer Wendy's. My wife and I do not go here very often anymore. We had food missing from our order, cold or burnt sandwiches, and salads that were very wilted.  ...  ... The lights for the restaurant and drive through are turned off some nights at 9 or 10 pm. It doesn't seem like they are open. We went through the drive through and were the only ones there. A lot of service errors for just us being served.  ...  ... Would gladly go back if the service and quality went back up.

April 19, 2011, btwn 1:30p.m - 2p.m, I drove thru Wendys drive thru and ordered #3. Then I asked the lady if it comes with the sea salted french fries and her reply was " well thats the only fries we have" in a sarcasm VOICE! The reason I asked, was because the last time I was there, the fries tasted just like the regular one! So I said, "I was only asking" and she was like "wat else can I get for u" she sounded so irritated! I cancelled my order and wen to Rally's where they were able to provide me with great customer service! You see, I've been in the customer service field for quite sometimes. I try to delive the best I can in helping customer in every other ways I can. I expect to be treated the same. No matter how Irate or grumpy the customer gets, I don't let it bother me. Theres a reason that their like that. So whatever issue that cashier was having that day, I hope she learns not to let things get to her easily. I won't let her treatment towards me stop me from going to Wendys, I will not go to their location.

I knew it was a bad idea to insult my taste buds with Wendy's salt lick menu but my little girl needed to make a restroom stop so   We started our dissatisfied adventure.  ...  ... Restrooms were just as clean as the tables, not so nice! The counter guy was pleasant considering he was overwhelmed with his tasks. Trying to catch up from forgetting portions of people's orders while trying to take hours. He did have a good attitude tho!  ...  ... Received our food and I had a nice long black curly hair sticking out of the box before I even opened it to find it nicely tucked into my hamburger. As I approached the counter, the manager was actually on the way out of the back so I was able to bring it to her attention. She quickly apologized and brought me out a new cheeseburger immediately. She thanked me for not yelling at her, which is very much appreciated considering both of us know how people can be with situations like this. Overall, Wendy's in general but this location not ring exempt has always been a bit of a let down to me. I do have to give a shot out to the manager though for her exceptional customer service!

Worst Wendy's ever!  I live like 6 blocks away.  Every time I've gone here, over several years, they've gotten my order wrong. After not going there for about a year, I decided to try getting an iced mocha.  They got that wrong too..and that was the only thing I ordered and I was the only drive thru customer.  Also, the cashier tried to send me off after I paid but before remembering she hadn't even given me my drink..WTF! What a bunch of F-tards!  Wish I could give them zero stars.  Really wish they could get their act together considering how close they are; but won't give them any more money.  They used to be open for breakfast but no longer..only lunch and dinner.  Probably because they suck! Oh and when they were open for breakfast, half the time I would get a panini, the tomatoes would be missing! I remember when they remodeled, I gave them another chance because I figured maybe they finally got rid of the dead wood...and they did, but somehow managed to get more lazy, dumb ass dufuses..this is not an employee issue..this is a management issue.  They simply don't care if they put themselves out of a job.

REVIEW #2:  3 stars  (298 chars)
Has a huge tendency to be very slow and backed up. Waiting doe drink refills is crazy. Summer is not so bad but in winter with the snowbirds it is horrible.  ...  ... Wendy's really needs to get more diet friendly meals and less fat in their so called healthy salads and things. This one is average

REVIEW #3:  2 stars  (774 chars)
I don't usually feel compelled to review fast food, but this Wendy's location has disappointed me so many times, it deserves a review. ...  ... It fails at the primary goal of eating a CHAIN fast food restaurant: consistency.    Depending on when you go there, you might get  a great burger or an almost cold one where the cheese isn't even going to melt. ...  ... The staff, as nice as most of them are, seem overworked, frantic at times and poorly trained. ...  ... Asking them for a baked potato sometimes elicits a response akin to having asked them to predict the next set of lottery numbers.  ...  ... This is an example of how to do a Wendy's franchise in the WRONG way. ...  ... I don't blame the kids who work there, I blame the management and franchise (?) owners.

REVIEW #4:  1 stars  (559 chars)
Eww. I ordered a cheeseburger from this spot, & was so grossed out by what they served up. Not normal, even for the low standards Wendy's has conditioned us to accept. For $1 a cheeseburger you might as well go to Waffle House, always open with $1 cheeseburgers too. At some point, customers will need to wake up to the fact that they are not in the business of serving good quality food for reasonable prices, they just want to take the money, & will leave you with a bag of nasty crap the dog shouldn't eat if that's what they think it takes to get your $1.

I really feel like it's my duty to warn others that if you come to this Wendy's to please bring your patience. Please don't stop here for a quick bite or if you're in a rush. The people here work at their own pace. They are all very friendly, but this area is full of retirees and quite a few of them work here. They will chat with you all day about various things, but you have to be willing to give about 10 minutes more of your time whenever you place an order.  ...  ... I repeat this specific Wendy's is not a "fast" food joint, but my order here is always right.  :)

REVIEW #4:  1 stars  (460 chars)
its hard to mess up a wendys burger, but this location seems to have figured out how to do it. Our food was luke warm at best. the french fries, tasted old, and where cold.  If you don't mind eating food that has been sitting under a hot lamp, this is the place for you, if you want hot food, you would be  better to leave it on your dashboard. as much as i hate to say it, try to avoid this location. I didn't even make a complaint, figured why waste my time.

REVIEW #5:  1 stars  (1313 chars)
OK so by now most people know I am a pretty patience guy but every time I eat here it seems as if time slows down.The words fast food can not and should not be used when describing this place. First off let me start by saying that this place while a chain seems to be the broken link.  ...  ... In the last three times I was forced to eat here (friends choice) I did not recive my complete order, was over charged, and received food that looked like it was left by a previous customer. Soggy fries, burgers coated in so much grease the bun would have slid off had it not been for all the cheese that held it to the wrapper! Of course this was after the long wait time (clocked at over 12 mins by my friend on one visit!) So why do people still eat here is my question? Maybe they are still stuck on the memories of cold and tasty frosty's.  ...  ... Or maybe it was the times they enjoyed a biggie drink with free refills on a blazing 110 summer day here in phoenix. Who knows? I think that since they were acquired by Arby's there was no place for them to go but down hill. Dave Thomas would flip in his grave if he could see the tiny dried up squares of cow flesh his customers where offered for their hard earned dollar, and Wendy well she would be in tears!  R.I.P. to Wendy's and to another childhood memory.

This wendy's is terrible. I grew up going to Wendy's but recently the whole chain has become disgusting. This one is just a slow, disgusting chain. Blah, rather eat pretty much any where else.

Worst Wendy's I've ever been too.  Went in over a year ago for breakfast special.  Waited in line for 20 minutes and then the order was all messed up.  Long and short.  Too many other good places out there.  Don't waste your time..

So bad.  Service is always so slow inside.  It's like they only care about the drive through and they usually screw that up too. I know it's Wendy's so my expectations aren't high but this place still manages to consistently disappoint.  Seems like poor managers.  Once I had a really nice cashier that was trying hard and even asked for help from other employees when she got backed up but she was told to stop complaining and just go slower.  I looked around and saw two other employees flirting with a group of teenagers pretending to clean tables.  I could go on with more stories like this but the general trend is slooow bad service with managers who are mean and don't care about customers.

As far as Wendy's go, this is a nice location.  It offers a fireplace and all menus are updated on LCD screens.  The whole place has a nice feel to it and even offers the new coke machines where you have a ton of options to choose from.  I will be visiting this location again.

Best Wendys ever!! So new looking. This wendys even has a coffee house menu with fresh baked goods, tea and coffee. Place is so clean, has a fake fire place area with cute seating. Free wifi as well as those all in one soda machines. I would go here for a coffee break and a meal, the dollar menu is amazing 5 piece nuggets for a dollar each! Lots of parking right by paradise valley mall.

REVIEW #3:  5 stars  (804 chars)
I know it seems like an oxymoron but check out the pics that I have uploaded and you will see what I mean. Wendy's is my favorite fast food among it's peers, McDonald's, BK, Arby's, Taco Bell and the like.  Here in AZ Wendy's has a pretty tasty breakfast menu and who can beat the Frosty's? So this location has recently gotten an extreme make over and my favorite addition is they now have 3 Coke Free Style machines. I love Peach Sprite so I know this will be my spot when I have a craving. They have free WiFi with comfy lounging chairs in the dining area near the fireplace, a flat screen TV above the fireplace and modern seating no more booths at this location. This location has also added fresh baked goods for your sweet tooth. All of this plus a 24 hour drive thru; this is a whole new Wendy's.

REVIEW #4:  5 stars  (461 chars)
This Wendy's is right by Paradise Valley Mall.  It has a completely revamped look, which is awesome.  I would recommend trying the Cheesey Chedderburgers on the dollar menu.  They are so great.  Plus, they're on the dollar menu....Hello?!?!  They are really fast and friendly there.  They also have those cool looking soda machines, if you like that kind of thing, which I do.  You get to choose different flavors of coke you would like.  It's just really cool.

Wow....can't believe I done it again. What you ask? Forget to review a place I have been to tons of times and right near my home. Well let me start with the infamous COKE FREESTYLE MACHINES......they are totally awesome. I mean imagine hundreds of different drink combinations to satisfy your thirst. My personal favorite is the PEACH Sprite and Strawberry Lemonade flavors......simply delicious. This location has been totally renovated and it has a superb modern look to it now. It is very clean....well lit..... and has an electric fireplace which adds a nice ambiance to the place. The staff is friendly and the service is great.....I Always receive my food very fast. If your in the neighborhood.....stop in and give this restaurant a try. Eat, Drink and be Merry my Friends!!!!

After reviewing the Starship McDonald's up in Flag last week, I noticed I forgot to post my review of this Next Generation fast food place from three months ago. D'oh! ...  ... Wow!  You have to give Wendy's credit for thinking outside the box.  This fast food restaurant is like no other I've been to. As some of my photos can attest, this is more of a comfy chair club with a lot of eye distractions than fast food chain with plastic chairs. For instance, it has a huge flat screen HDTV blasting ESPN's Sports Center that is situated above a faux fireplace. "A" for effort! ...  ... This Wendy's also has a coffee/barista station.  Though the "Joe" tastes more like a water down Seattle Best. Too bad they couldn't get a Tim Horton's contract, eh!  Also new, is the Coca-Cola brand soda dispensers that tends to make everything taste like Dr Pepper.  So if you are from Texas, this might be a good thing. LOL ...  ... As for the food, Wendy's continues to let the corporate kitchen rethink their menu items.  The food is very good and it will be interesting to see where they go with it after a couple of years. ...  ... So, in line with my thinking about most fast food places, Three Stars "A-OK". But I'll throw in a 1/2 Star for effort and originality.  Enjoy!

REVIEW #7:  3 stars  (384 chars)
Again it's a fast food joint.  Recently remodeled and looks nice, but the line to the counter is short and due to the screens on the way, narrow.  Kind of makes you feel like cattle heading to slaughter.  Maybe they could rework that aspect and makes it not quite so cozy. ...  ... Otherwise, they food was as we expect it to be from a global chain, nothing really special, just quick

REVIEW #8:  3 stars  (426 chars)
Came here few times before and after they remodel the place.  Now they have a fireplace and it's usually always on during winter time.  Okay location.  First thought they might open 24/7 but later they close rather early.  We need a place here that opens up 24 hours a day.  The only food I like getting here is the frosty.  The portion of their burgers are so tiny and the meat feels like it has been frozen before, not good.

REVIEW #9:  3 stars  (1930 chars)
My husband and I were at the Paradise Valley Mall yesterday, and instead of eating at the food court; we chose Wendy's. This Wendy's is gorgeous aesthetically, all the way down to the couch and fake fireplace! It really gives you that warm and cozy feeling! ...  ... The food offerings are great too! Not only does it offer all your Wendy's favorites, but they also have fresh baked goods. This includes cookies brownies, pieces of pie, and rolls. Want to spice up the taste of your soft drink? This is the place to do it! They offer coke products, but you can choose a variety of flavors to add, like cherry, peach, orange, raspberry or vanilla. I chose to have my usual ice tea with Splenda while my husband picked Raspberry Coke. It was enjoyed immensely! ...  ... Both of us ordered our favorite burgers, the baconator. He likes to add  tomato and extra cheese. I prefer mine with mustard, ketchup and pickle only. What happens at this point determined the three star rating. His burger did not have extra cheese which of course costs extra.  ...  ... We take the receipt up to the counter and are immediately told that it does have extra cheese. By looking at my burger, we can tell this is not true. My husband goes up to the counter again, and this time he is handed a cold  piece of cheese on a disposable tray. He decides to help me eat before returning a third time! ...  ... This time the manager asks what the problem is. We explain that he added tomato and extra cheese. She says, "did they not add tomato?" If you looked at the sandwich with tomato and the slice of unmelted cheese, the tomato was obviously not the issue. Finally, she put two and two together and remade his sandwich. She also reminded the employees that they cook the burgers to order and gave me a free chocolate frosty for the inconvenience! ...  ... The bottom line is this Wendy's is classy, but needs to remember the customer is always right!

REVIEW #10:  3 stars  (2667 chars)
This Wendy's is one of the newly remodeled editions here in the Valley. Like at least one other that I've visited, the new decor inside is pretty impressive. If you've ever been to a Wendy's, you know that the decor really hasn't changed much over the decades. Those days, however, are officially over. ...  ... The most prominent of all of the changes is the faux fireplace with the lounge seating area. There are four lowboy lounge chairs surrounding two small tables seating in front of the fireplace, with a nice HD television mounted on the wall above. It LOOKS really nice. But, as I stayed a little while, I noticed how uncomfortable these chairs appeared to be for every patron who sat in them.  ...  ... Being that the chairs are low, and clearly built for relaxation rather than function, there doesn't appear to be any comfortable way to sit in them while eating your food. The seat portion is quite deep, allowing you to appear like you're reclining. However, that particular position is not conducive to comfortable eating. Every time a patron wanted to take a bite, they had to awkwardly make their way back to the edge of the chair to get back to their food. From there, the customers didn't have any back support. Plus, if you're a tall person, your knees are guaranteed to be up in your chest while you're leaning forward to get to your food. If you're a child or a smaller person, your legs are going to dangle off of the edge, as the cushion is so deep. It's truly a Catch 22 sitting in these seats to dine. As a lounge, though, it's quite nice. ...  ... My family and I managed to get a much more comfortable seat at one of the bar-style high tops located around the many floor-to-ceiling windows. It gave us a great opportunity to see what a train wreck the parking lot at this particular location can be. This day happened to be particularly crowded, it seemed. Every time somebody tried to pull out of their parking spot, they had to wait for what seemed like five minutes before there was a clearing. The way this parking lot is designed, if you take a left out of the drive-thru and go back around the building, you're pretty much screwed. You'll end up fighting people trying to get INTO the drive-thru, as well as the people trying to leave the parking lot to get out altogether. So, a word to the wise, turn right out of the drive-thru. ...  ... At its core, it's still a Wendy's. There are a few new additions to the menu, but it's pretty much the same old same old. If you do visit this remodeled version of Wendy's, try to go during an off-peak time. That way, you can avoid the general chaos that ensues when this place is at capacity.

So, I was in the area getting sweets for my sweetie on Valentine's Day.  It was lunchtime.  I haven't been to a Wendy's in oh, ten years or so and I was in a hurry, it was convenient and I decided to drop in and give it a try.  I wheeled into the parking lot they shared with Arby's at PV mall.  Walked into the vestibule - you don't enter directly to the restaurant, but as soon as I opened the door, there was this overpowering stench of sewer.  Ugh, I thought.  I entered the next door into the restaurant and the smell did not go away.  I was thinking, "PEOPLE! Don't you smell that ghastly odor?  How can you sit there and eat while breathing this disgusting aroma?" ...  ... People didn't budge, they just kept on eating like nothing was happening.  That was scary enough.  There was nobody in line to order, and nobody behind the counter to take an order - at lunchtime, mind you.  I could hear voices laughing in the kitchen and I could see people prepping food through a doorway into the kitchen.  I assumed someone would be out momentarily as I had made eye contact with one of the laughing people in the kitchen.  I figured I'd order quickly and be on my way before I choked from the stench. ...  ... I waited as long as I could.  Maybe two minutes.  I could see the dark spots forming in my vision as my chest burned with the acrid aroma.  It was totally killing my appetite.  I could not wait longer.  I practically ran for the door and the fresh air outside.  Fortunately, I made it out alive and gasped a deep breath of clean, cool air, clearing my lungs and nostrils of Wendy's smell.  Arby's was right across the parking lot.  I ran for my truck and moved it to the other side of the lot so that none of that stench would get on it. ...  ... Sorry Wendy's but you STINK!

Gotta love that value menu they got. $.99 Fries, $.99 frosty, a chicken Caesar wrap or two for $1.30(ish)/each. They do a good job of making sure the price is great, food is above average, the building is good, and customer service is good. I think they do a fabulous job at staying abreast of all these things simultaneously and think it doesn't get any better than that on the whole. Very cheap for above average fast food, which isn't very common.

REVIEW #2:  5 stars  (489 chars)
I have to review this place to give it 5 stars for just one sandwich.  For what it is (fast food) their hamburger (not all of them) is top notch. ...  ... Here's the deal.  Go in and get a 1/2 pound double with cheese.  No substitutions.  Nada. ...  ... Get some napkins too.  You'll need them. ...  ... I'm pretty snobby about burgers. Holy crap is it good. It just is. I almost hate that it is so damn good.  BUT IT IS! ...  ... Could be that I didn't spend $13 dollars on it, BUT IT IS!

REVIEW #3:  4 stars  (416 chars)
I can only rate the drive-thru here, as I have never been inside. I'm always skeptical about the long line that tends to form at the drive-thru, no matter what time of day I go. But the line always moves quickly. The staff here is on top of their game for sure.  ...  ... The junior cheeseburger is one of my favorite things on earth. Less than 300 calories and just enough to keep me going, without slowing me down.

I've come here for lunch on and off for the past few months I've been working at my new job.  This place isn't half bad, and its just like any other wendys I've been to.  Lunch hour is busy in the resturant and the drive through, so come prepared and expect some delays when ordering.  They also serve breakfast here, and I've never had a bad experience yet!  In and out in no time!

I got a phone call from the Manager of this location Bill, since I reported my horrible experience to corporate. Who apologized sincerely for my experience, and said it was entirely uncalled for. He did say they were out of barbecue sauce but did say that they had more then just the other sauce the girl offered. He did not sound to happy with his employees, and did mention that it was towards closing when I came thru the drive thru, but said it was totatlly uncalled for.  In any event he offered to replace my meal for me.  The verdict is not out yet, we will see how my replacement meal is. I will give them a shot on the replacement but the verdict is not out yet.

Look no further ...   ...  ... Looking for a healthy salad at a fast food establishment can be challenging  to say the least.  After all most fast food restaurants aren't know for their great tasting salads.  With that in mind I decided to give Wendy's a try.  I gave the menu a quick look over and decided to order the Apple Pecan Chicken Salad.   ...  ... After the first bite I was convinced  Wendy's is pulling away from the fast food salad pack by offering flavorful salad options.  TheApple Pecan Chicken Saladis a mix of greens (Iceberg, Romaine, and Spring) with blue cheese crumbles, dried cranberries, candied pecans, apple chunks, and grilled chicken pieces with a raspberry vinaigrette. I enjoyed the taste of the sweet apples, sugared pecans, cranberries and chicken. I am not a fan blue cheese crumbles  so I asked to keep that off. All the mixtures of taste and flavor came  together and allowed for a surprisingly  light and very tasteful salad.   ...  ... I have returned back for the  Apple Pecan Chicken Salad--fresh, plenty of flavor, and just six bucks.  How can you beat that. I'll keep coming back.

REVIEW #12:  3 stars  (687 chars)
This location is located in the classy around the area of the Camelback Colonnade area. With many fast food options and restaurants in the area this Wendy's location has seemed to do very well. The interior is updated and the location is always clean. The service is fast, friendly and a great bang for the buck. I think Wendy's has probably one of the best breakfast as far as options and quality food. The only issue I have with this location is my orders are not always up to par. My food thru the drive thru only has been served cold or prepared wrong. Meaning if I ask for no sauce they will still add the sauce. It happens all the time. Other then that everything else is all good.

REVIEW #13:  2 stars  (711 chars)
OK, So I went back to this location for my FREE meal, well there was no problem with getting the free meal, except that the girl at the counter that rang it up must have been stoned, because in between punching in my order which was pretty simple because it was on a receipt right in front of her and her singing a Brittany Spears tune, it took her like almost 10 minutes to ring it up, while I am standing there forgot to give me cups for my drinks, which I had to ask her for, and in general the food once again was crap, the fries were dry and hard, the nuggets tasted OK, and the burger was once again crushed. I use to like Wendy's I guess this what you must come to expect from today's fast food business.

REVIEW #14:  2 stars  (808 chars)
Wendy's has been my fav fast food restaurant since I was a kid.  This is the closest one to my home and I will pass by 3 McDonald's and a Jack-in-the-box to get there.  Each time I have eaten there has been a real disappointment. I don't eat fast food often but I know what Wendy's should taste like. The overall quality seems to really be suffering at this location. The fries and the meat are consistently overcooked and taste as if they've been sitting for long stints.  I usually go after work around 6pm. Each time I ask them to rectify the issues I experienced the last time. Each time it comes out just like the previous visit.  I am not a picky eater but I do expect quality and consistency when I pay a restaurant for food and have been a loyal customer for years.  I won't go back to this location.

I went to this location after picking up a friend from work, because she was hungry, and it was on the way home. The wait in the drive thru, was fairly short, and about the only good thing about this location. But when I got to the window the girl in the window, ruined the whole experience, she was quite rude, and did not appear to speak very much English.  ...  ... She failed to give us one of our drinks we had ordered and paid for, and had to ask for it. She also did not give us any straws, which we did not notice till after we left the drive thru. We also ordered a 5 piece chicken nugget, and asked for barbecue sauce. The girl said that Wendy's only carried one type of sauce, honey mustard, and that is all we could have. In general this experience was horrible, the burger I got in the Baconator combo was crushed, the fries were old and stale tasting and the 5 piece chicken nuggets were old and dry. ...  ...  I feel that it was toward the end of the night on a Sunday and this employee was not happy to be there and also I think they gave us old food, that was pre-made and had been sitting for a while. Either that or she was poorly trained, I am sure the language barrier had something to do with it too!

I work right next to this Wendy's, which is why I continue to go back even after they mess my order up time and again.   I am a very patient man, but oh my god.    The level of ineptitude in this place is extraordinary.   I think they may actually train the employees to be horrible at their jobs.   If I were the owner of this franchise I would be furious with the way it's run.     ...  ... The last 5 times I've been there they messed up my order.    They're batting 100 percent.    Haha! ...  ... For some reason I just can't resist the chipotle chicken sandwich no matter how they manage to mess it up.     ...  ...  ... Awesome sandwich, horrible employees.    I only have one word for the management there.    Training!

This place tops my chart as the worst customer service I have ever received in my entire life. Having just been released from the hospital and given the okay to eat whatever I wanted, I fast tracked it to the nearest fast food joint I could find to grab a quick meal.  ...  ... I was initially greeted with, "What do you want?" I brushed this aside despite it being overly rude and attempted to order food for my family. I say "attempted" because, for the first time in my life, I didn't make it past the drive-thru speaker.  ...  ... While ordering, the lady taking my order began speaking with another employee about prices. About 15 seconds of this went on before she returned to speaking with me.  ...  ... Having just waited for her to have a conversation that could've waited the 15 seconds it would have taken me to place my order, she begins speaking to me in a rushed manner. "Do you want your combo 'this style, this style, or this style'? Size? What to drink?" Not only was this the icing on the cake for me, but I looked at my fiance to make sure that I wasn't in the wrong. Her look was also that of disbelief. I calmly told the lady that she was being "f***ing rude" and left for what turned out to be a Burger King down the road. Despite the BK's slower than usual service, it was 10x better than what I received at this place.  ...  ... All-in-all: This place marks the first time that I was unable to make it past the ordering phase at any fast food location. Considering the bad service I have received elsewhere, this place makes its way to the top of the list for worst overall. I will never return to this place.

What an odd and disappointing experience! ...  ... I simply asked the cashier to confirm the contents of the Monterey Ranch Crispy Chicken Sandwich (I wanted to make sure that it didn't have any bacon) and I got a snippy, sarcastic, and just plain rude tone from the cashier. ...  ... The food came out within a couple minutes, which probably accounts for the french fries being cold and stiff and the sandwiches having unmelted cheese. ...  ... I can't remember when I've ever had such a bad experience at a Wendy's, but by the look of some other reviews as well, it looks like it's best to treat this branch as a poor exception to the norm.

I agree with most other reviewers... They are pretty darn fast for lunch rush in drive thru, never had a mistake on my order and the people are nice in drive thru. Good for them at serving people the right way.

About every other day on my way into work I have a choice to make. Do I make a right and go to Mickey D's for a sausage mcmuffin with egg, then have to wait at the light to cross over the traffic at Deer Valley. Or do I make a left on 23rd then right into the Wendy's parking lot for a new Artisan Sausage sandwich? The first time I made that decision I felt like going to catholic confession. "Dear Father, forgive me for I have sinned. It has been 24 years since my last confession. I cheated on my favorite fast food breakfast today..." After that day, I always drive by and wave at the relationship with McDonalds that I kicked to the curb for the hotter better breakfast fast food. The sandwich is awesome, soft artisan bread with fresh cracked egg (yoke still intact) asiago cheese and a "not greasy" sausage patty and hollandaise sauce. The potatoes are country style wedges with the skin still on them. The coffee rivals' dunkin doughnuts and the drive through is super efficient. Can you believe that they actually take the time to look at my CC and thank me by name? Before you go out to your local Wendy's in search of breakfast bliss, check to see if they serve the new menu items. I have driven 15 miles off course and to three restaurants looking for the new menu items in the east valley. Not all restaurants carry the new breakfast menu.  ...  ... McDonalds I am filing for divorce and I want alimony for all those years that you could have provided me a healthier better tasting breakfast sandwich. My breakfast lawyer will be contacting you soon.

For a chain this store is OK. ... Clean and friendly staff...and the place is clean too! ... The food is hot most of the time. ... Drive thru gets my order filled correctly every time. No shorted items that I can remember. ... Their prices are higher than another Wendy's less than a mile from this one. Probably because they are so close to the highway.

REVIEW #4:  4 stars  (223 chars)
I've never had a problem at this Wendy's. It is one of the few drive-thrus that don't screw up the order.  ...  ... Food is always fresh and hot. Those pretzel-bun bacon burgers are mighty tasty, in case you were wondering.

REVIEW #5:  4 stars  (521 chars)
Mary runs a top notch operation at this Wendy's, I don't like throwing 5 star reviews every where I go, but this place deserves it. Whether there is a line of 10 people or no line at all, you're out of there within minutes, and my order has always been correct. It makes me think that all fast food restaurants would have a better rap if they adopted the way she runs the store. It's nice to know that I'll truly be in-n-out in no time at all. Thanks for the good service Mary. ...  ... -A customer right down the street.

REVIEW #6:  4 stars  (311 chars)
Solid Wendy's location. I come here for lunch sometimes and the food is hot, quick and the order is correct.   the workers are nice enough and they even asked if I wanted ketchup in the drive thru which is almost unheard of these days!  The new burgers, french fries and brewed iced tea is my personal favorite!

REVIEW #7:  4 stars  (459 chars)
Wendy's new burgers are SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO much better.  I love the thicker cut and the new butter buns.  That sounded dirty but seriously they are a night and day difference.  Pair that with the seasalt fries and for fast food you got a nice meal.  I will for sure be back.   ...  ... oh and p.s. the caramel apple parfait frosty is good but it's really small compared to what you think you may be getting and for the price it's not worth it in my opinion.

REVIEW #8:  4 stars  (302 chars)
Wendys hasn't been Wendys for years now. It is owned by Arbys. But either way this is a very good "Wendys". If anyone noticed, the food turned to crap awhile ago. If you are craving Wendys, this one is pretty much the cleanest in the area. The workers actually seem to care! This is my favorite Wendys.

REVIEW #9:  2 stars  (221 chars)
Usually this is a good location. I actually drive out of my way past another wendys to get to this one. My chili was not hot nor was the container filled. My nuggets were old and stale. Very disappointed after this visit.

I was very impressed with this Wendy's! The interior was unlike any Wendy's I've been to. It is much more upscale and has a much more cafe like feel to it. My order was taken by what appeared to be the manager. She was very friendly and she involved the other staff in my order. They were all very friendly and prompt. I tried the Ranch Flatbread sandwich and a Caesar salad. The sandwich was a bit messy to way but tasted very good. I'm not in this part of town very often but I definitely recommend this location.

REVIEW #2:  3 stars  (383 chars)
This is a nice looking Wendy's both on the outside and inside. Everything about the appearance is fresh and new and the little artificial fireplace is nice. ...  ... Sadly the food is not any better than any other Wendy's and may even be a little less than average. It's OK for the price and when I feel like fast food I may opt for Wendy's, but in general I like to try to avoid it.

REVIEW #3:  2 stars  (229 chars)
Every time I go here my burgers are swimming in grease. You unwrap the paper and theres a pool of it. Gross! This was my second time here. I figured I'd give them another shot. Nope. Same thing. 2 stars for the Frosty. That's it.

REVIEW #1:  5 stars  (1114 chars)
I know it is silly to give a Wendy's a 5-star review but really, this is the greatest Wendy's of all time.  The food is typical Wendy's food.  It doesn't taste any better or worse than it should and that is just fine.  The reason this place rocks is because of the service, particularly, the Drive-Thru. ...  ... Let me play this scenario out for you.  You pull up and order your meal. Girl on the speaker says $2.90 at the first window. As you get up to the first window, you hand her $3 in cash...she already has a dime in her hand and gives it to you while saying "second window." As you pull up to the second window, you barely have time to press the brake because the guy at the second window is there with your bag of food hanging out ready for you to grab it as you drive by.  I can literally go through this Wendy's drive-thu in under 30 seconds.  It is amazing.  They couldn't be faster if I called ahead.   ...  ... Considering how little time many of us get for lunch, a place like this is really a blessing.  The manager who trains his staff to perform so well should be commended. I love this Wendy's!

REVIEW #2:  4 stars  (628 chars)
I'm kind of surprised that this place has gotten such low reviews, and I can only assume that their game must have come up quite a bit since some of these. ...  ... I normally wouldn't review a fast food chain but this place is clean, quiet and I've never had an issue.  I actually drive an extra couple of minutes to go to this location rather than the one down on Glendale Ave. ...  ... Also, let me just say, YOU HAVE TO TRY THE NEW BREAKFAST!  I love a good chicken biscuit, and the one they serve has got honey butter on it as well.  Wendys has really upped the ante for breakfast fast food.  Try it out, you'll love it!!!!

REVIEW #3:  3 stars  (2298 chars)
I've been eating here on and off since I moved to this side of town a few months ago, and I have a mixed bag of thoughts for this place.  The experiences have been a combination of fine, okay, and a few "that was really bad" experiences as well. ...  ... For starters, the food here is pretty consistent, and the menu itself is like every other Wendy's. I like Wendy's because I like a lot of their menu items, and I don't feel so guilty for eating fast food after leaving here.  Overall, the chain is great, but this location's kinda weird. ...  ... For starters, sometimes I've come here and the place has felt and looked sub par when dining in.  For a while, the carpeting in their dining area looked filthy, and it grossed me out.  Now the carpeting is clean, so I guess they had to cleaned and de-filthed. ...  ... Other times, when in the drive through, the service has been okay.  I remember one time I was here in the middle of the day (like 3 pm, so it wasn't a busy meal hour) and even though I ordered a single combo meal, they made me pull forward and wait with another car for them to walk my order out.  Um, I can't imagine why they would do that, since it wasn't really all that busy.  I ended up waiting about 5 minutes, maybe 10 in the parking lot with another car for my food.  This morning I saw a white van that went through the drive through and they were waiting as well for their food to get walked out.  Unless the drive thru people are trying to shave time off how long it takes them to get their drive thru order, it doesn't make any sense.  I wish it were more consistent in this area.  After having been to a few Wendy's this is the only location that has this bad habit in their drive thru and its kind of annoying.  ...  ... I will say, sometimes I come here and think, "this place is so dirty today and it took forever to get my food, I'm going home and giving it one star." Other times I come here and everything is fine, and I think "ya know what? It wasn't so bad today, I'm going to go home and give them 5 stars."  I settled on 3 because I figured it was a fair assumption of both the good and bad experiences that I've had here.  Most of my complaints are in regards to cleanliness and wait times, not so much the food, because the food is consistent and tasty.

I agree with Glenn about this Wendy's is on top of it with there service but check out the pic of the Chicken Sandwich I ordered with lettuce. WITH LETTUCE. Haha What the hell is this. lol I just had to laugh and take a pic when I opened this up. I usually only go here for fries and frostys.

Fries were over salted the last 3 times. Very disappointing for me because I generally love Wendy's.  If you can avoid the fries odds are the are extremely salty.

I am not a big fast food guy but this place clinched it for me.  I ordered the chicken sandwich as I have done many times before.  This time, I got extremely ill after no less than 10 minutes.  This rarely happens to me but feel the need to share.  I am sure it's 1 in a million but I will admit that this location is on my black list and urge people to ask for the meat well done.

This review is pretty much for the limited time Chicken Flat bread.  I really liked this sandwich.  It is better than their hamburgers.  Quite a lot of flavor.  I hope to see it back soon.  Not much else to brag about this place.  The salads and chili are just maybe ok.

I really like one of their managers who is here during the weekdays. He is very good at keeping the staff on their toes but I haven't seen him as recently as my last visit.

This Wendy's is okay if you don't have time to look for another one. The service is average and they almost always seem to have only one available cashier to help the large lunch crowd. My kudos to that poor woman. But the management gets a thumbs down for not assigning enough people. ...  ... Also it seems like all the weirdos in Phoenix come in to order.  ...  ... Don't go to this Wendy's unless you are willing to wait in line for a long time while some weirdo is glancing at you every thirty seconds.

After landing in PHX but before embarking on a 2.5 hour drive to Flagstaff, i thought Wendy's would be a safe and easy place to grab some food on the go...well, I was wrong. ...  ... * Chicken Nuggets: dry, freezer-burned meat with extra hard double-fried shell. ...  ... * French Fries: super hot, crunchy, over-fried french-fry-shaped fry-shells. so hard and crunchy that i thought i was eating french-fry chips. ...  ... * Junior Bacon Cheese Burger: bacon and burger meat both tasted dehydrated. ...  ... Guess what, last thing I want after a 4hr flight and landing in 100+ weather is hot, dry, crunchy, tasteless food!

Don't park your car and expect it to be there when you come out after eating there.  They towed my car today because I did not eat in the restaurant.  Unfortuantly we did eat there and could not get out of the parking lot because of event across the street.  So we walked around the nuthouse01area for a bit came back and car was gone. Talked to manager who said we did not eat there and I showed receipt and was told that was I was not seen on some camera so I did not eat there.  Now have to wait until Monday to get my car.  Well thats it never eat here again.   ...  ... Lost customer for ever Wendy'  Wish Dave were alive he would have treated customer much differently. ... Shame on Wendy's

I have no hesitation in giving this review one star.  I wanted a Frosty, but left without anything.  The patron two cars in front of me apparently thought she was ordering at a fine dining establishment.  It's Wendys not a fancy steakhouse. While waiting for this person to finish ordering her lenghtly and detailed order, a bum tried to ask me for change.  I promptly told him to get the F*** out of here.  I took my own advice and did the same.  Will not be back to this location.

My be got food here once and all of it was just thrown together and cold . I thought I'd play it safe and get a frosty today since my one surgery can't eat fast food . So there was something in my frosty I almost puked and had to throw it away . Don't go to this location

My friend ordered chicken nuggets, and two of them were molded together. I'm vegetarian, so I sat there with my crappy fries but tasty frosty and watched the madness unfold. ...  ... As she tore the two melded nuggets away from each other, THERE WAS A GELLY WHITE PASTE THAT DRIPPED OUT. I am literally gagging just recalling the incident, and I almost threw up all over the table. ...  ... This exact same scenario happened to my sister, on her totally different box of chicken nuggets 45 second later. Nobody finished our food. We all just left. ...  ... There is white gooey crap IN THE FOOD at wendys.  ...  ... So incredibly gross. SO gross. Gross. Don't go here, for the love of god!!

Not one but TWO times had to drive back around and give them back the food they handed me. Two times they gave me someone else's food! Every time I tried to check, they told me they were busy and that I needed to pull forward if I wanted to check.  ...  ... I just wanted to try their salad.  ...  ... Every fast food restaurant has the ability to make a decision: are you going to be as bad as everyone expects, or are you going to take the time to do it right? ...  ... Wendy's of 301 E Indian School, I hope you read this. Moreover, I hope you try harder to take the time to do it right. I believe in you.

Really not sure how to rate it since the service sucks so bad. Pretend it's a 1 1/2 star I guess. ...  ... For the second time in a week I've received my Jr. Bacon Cheeseburger with no bacon. How does that happen? ...  ... Other incidents have included but are probably not limited to: a mysteriously soggy bun, buns that were harder than they should have been, missing food and other various problems typically associated with these type of eateries. ...  ... I know it's fast food but come on people. Get it together! ...  ... Also keep an eye out for your straw as this Wendy's is notorious for giving you your drink and then giving you nothing to drink your drink with. I don't know why Wendy's insists on putting the straw in the bag since they more often than not forget to. ...  ... If it weren't opened 24 hours and I wasn't such a gluten for punishment I'd never go here. ...  ... Dave was cool, this Wendy's is not!

Wendy's new BREAKFAST blows! ...  ... I've never been a huge fan of Wendy's food, however seeing their big window sign of their new breakfast sandwiches drew me in.  My God they looked good!  And my God was I disappointed.   ...  ... I had a sausage biscuit with a kick ass looking buttermilk bun that was infused with syrup.  The meat was spicy (ala McDonnalds) but the rest was just yucky.  I highly recommend you skip Wendy's for breakfast.  Bummer.

Hit and miss on the food here, mine was OK and my wife's was terrible. Not a place to go if you like your food fresh cooked. Our food was on the counter about 30 seconds after we ordered which tells me they pulled it all out of a warmer, threw it together and placed it on a tray at lightning speed. I can appreciate the fact that it's a "fast food" restaurant but I went for breakfast and it doesn't take that long to cook an egg.

REVIEW #3:  3 stars  (1335 chars)
The burgers here taste like they do at any other Wendys. You either like Wendys or you don't. Some of the past reviewers say it's hit and miss. I personally haven't experienced a miss. But if it's hit and miss that's just like any other fast food restaurant. Fast food restaurants set standards to what the food should taste like and customer service standards as well. It's up to the staff to uphold those standards.  ...  ... Most of the time I've only been through the drive-thru. I've only gone inside to eat lunch once. The order tasted great as usual. The only thing I can remember was the person at the register didn't seem too friendly. I wasn't greeted and it took about 3 minutes for him to say, "I can help you over here sir." ...  ... There's been a few times where I don't even get the proper greeting at the drive-thru either. I pull-up and all I hear is, "what can I get you?" To me that just worries me of what's to come. If they don't care about the Wendy's standards enough to simply say, "Thank for choosing Wendy's..." or something along those lines, then what makes me believe they're going to care about the standards of my food. ...  ... Despite these flaws of this location I haven't had a miss on the quality of my food. Wendy's should really re-train the staff at this location as my patience is wearing thin.

Asked for the Portabella Brioche burger... No mushrooms, so instead I got a number 1. Ketchup out in the lobby... So I let the girl on register know. She lazily said (without looking at me) "there are packets there" and points at a little basket. Then I ask for ranch. They were ALSO out of ranch. But I guess it's ok because my fries weren't burnt. Close this store and take inventory because you don't have a lot.

The Baconator. How can you not?  ...  ... I rather like Wendy's for fast food...There is just something about those square hamburgers...You know like the Huey Lewis song. ...  ... The hamburger is amazing, two square patties, something around a billion pieces of bacon and cheese dripping enoughh off the sides to leave you a delicious desert of lickable cheese paper. ...  ... I have a thing for their soggy salty fries, it is hard to scoop up frosty with them, but once you do you are in freakish eater heaven. The salt and chocolate are just the right combination. ...  ... This peticular resturaunt was lame, even by fast food standards. The drive-through was not friendly, I got only two napkins, no spoon for my frosty (thank god for the fries) and no offer of ketchup. ...  ... The Baconator will be back...and soon, and I doubt that you want to use a Wendy's bathroom so take it home.

Been here a couple times and its been hit or miss. I usually have no problem, drive thru is pretty fast even during their busy hours. But the last time I went I ordered a combo meal at the drive thru and as I pulled away realized there were no fries in my bag. No biggie but when I went inside to get them, instead of just giving them to me, the girl at the counter called the drive thru girl over and asked her if I got my fries. Working in customer service for many years I found this to be very odd and demeaning in a way. Almost as if she was accusing me of lying without outright saying it. Over an order of french fries mind you. Well when the drive thru girl came over she looked me in the eyes and said "You know I gave you your fries" rolled her eyes and walked away before I could respond. The first girl I spoke to then proceeded to help the next person in line without speaking to me again. I honestly couldn't believe it. I mean really?  What kind of customer service is that?  When the cashier finished with the gentlman behind me she gave me an exasperated look of "what do you want?" Now I wasn't even mad when they forgot my fries, mistakes happen, but at this point I was reaching my boiling point. So I replied "Either you give me the fries I paid for or give me both your names and the number to your corporate office...you decide." I got yet another eye roll but finally received my fries!  Last time I go here though...too bad because it's the only location near my house.

Horrible! Stopped in on 4-12-12, went through drive-thru after 11:50pm...ordered the #2. I thought I was gonna get fresh fries and burger...I ended up getting nasty fries, looked like it was made hours earlier and has been sitting out...GROSS!  The burger was sloppy made and had a fish taste. Don't stop there after 11-11:30pm. This is the last time I will ever eat at Wendys on 35th ave and Bethany hm rd. I tossed out the food and it was too late going back to ask for a whole new order. Should've just went over to Whataburger since they make it fresh instead of stale fries and burgers.

Okay... Someone has to tell the management and maybe corporate that the drive-thru is ridiculous in both lack of speed and space for my vehicle. If you have a dually or after market rims, stay away!!  ...  ... I've been to this location twice now and both times I've waited 25+ min with only about 3-4 cars ahead of me and both times were around 9pm.  And it's not like they don't have the man power to pump out food in a decent amount of time because when I went in to complain, I counted over 10 employees!  ...  ... When this location opened 2 months ago, I was amazed at how busy they were and when passing by, it would seem like they are always busy.  But, no joke, I realized that the reason why they always look busy is because the drive-thru line doesn't move. I was unfortunate enough to end up in the actual lane, and was watching as cars lined up behind me and then speed off after 5 min of waiting without moving... lol...   They really need to correct this ASAP!!

Located in the T-4 D gates this is the place to stop for your super large super cheap iced coffee.

Typical Wendy's grub. Certainly better than BK and McD's but still nothing to write home about... I bumped the rating up a star (2 to 3) simply because of the location, fast service and reasonable prices (for an airport). Expect 2 star food with 3 star service in an airport, but nothing more.

I was starved and Wendy's was the only fast food that was quick and easy in between my flights. Unfortunately, the line was super long and they only had 1 register open. I had an hour to spare, so I was willing to wait for hot food.  ...  ... Luckily, the line went quick. But, what I don't get is how there is only 1 cashier, 1 runner, and a ton of people working in the back kitchen. I was baffled...  ...  ... The cashier told me the wrong number so I was waiting for my order while other people's orders behind me came and went. When I questioned my order and conveyed what number I was given, they claimed that they didn't even have that number in the system.  ...  ... Perhaps I just made up a number of my own and wanted to wait for my food... Really?!

02.08.10 ...  ... I don't know why I almost always end my trip reviews with a bad one on a fast food restaurant at the airport.  This is no different. ...  ... Seriously, I know life sucks when you work at a fast food restaurant at the airport.  If you don't want to work there, maybe you should find another job.  It's definitely not good for business when you have a sour look on your face while you point me to another cashier because you don't feel like taking my order. ...  ... I did get an extra piece of nugget.  In your face.

Can't belive how rude the employees are here!  ...  ... I work down the street and have stopped in once before and today gave them another chance and will not be going back, EVER! ...  ... The employees are ridicoulsly rude, they don't greet you, they hand out the food with out even looking at you and for sure won't thank you for your business. How much longer is the disctric/region manager going to let this go on?

REVIEW #4:  1 stars  (414 chars)
The food was average Wendy's fare, the service was ok. The thing that got to me was the ladies bathroom.  ...    There was hair in the sinks. Both sinks. Not a stray hair. A bunch of hair. Like someone who was balding had brushed their hair while leaning over the sinks. I actually gagged. The hand dryer wasn't working either.  ...    You can tell a lot about an establishment by the state their bathrooms are in.

We went here for lunch today and was surprised to find a chicken bone in our crispy chicken sandwich! The worst part is that we mentioned it to an employee to let manager know and no one ever came out to talk to us about what happened. Disappointing to see lack of service and scary to know what could have happened if it was a child that could have choked on the bone since it was so big! We will never go back here after the lack of attention to the matter!

REVIEW #6:  1 stars  (262 chars)
Wendy's has the worst food of almost any fast food restaurant. ...  ... Their fries used to be good, but not so much anymore. ...  ... Their burgers are overly salty, their breakfast is terrible. ...  ... The Frosty is the only edible thing there. ...  ... Yuck.

REVIEW #7:  1 stars  (834 chars)
Wendy's use to be my favorite Burger joint when they use to make them when you ordered... The patty use to be twice the size as what they have now, maybe not twice but much bigger then now... This was the second time I have been to this particular restaurant both times through the drive through and both time's I had a burger that a dog wouldn't eat... The on I had today was dry and looked like it was made the day before... I usually check the food before I leave the parking lot  this time my wife picked the food up and when she got it home and I check it this is what I got a dried out pieace of garbage I took one bite then spit it back in the bag and put it in the garbage, there goes 4 bucks... I will never again eat at this Wendy's... So if you go through the drive through I suggest you check your food before you leave...

I had not been to Wendy's in.....forever. Went last week and tried their 1/2 Baja salad. It was really good. Then went again a few days ago and had the same thing and a potatoe. I like that they have the soda machines where you can get any flavor. They even have diet caffeine free vanilla coke and diet caffeine free cherry coke. The yhave remodeled several locations and it really doesn't flow well. Everything is all backed up, no way to escape. How about removing that wall so we can go sit down. Call us up when it's ready. Or for the people that are waiting for their to go order, let them have a special seating area to wait. They do have several seating areas and then some areas with tables and chairs.

REVIEW #2:  4 stars  (2882 chars)
It looks as though Wendy's is trying to reinvent themselves...and from what I've seen so far, they're well on their way! ...  ... Before moving away from North Phoenix, my family and I had been to this particular location a handful of times. It was your typical Wendy's experience. No bells and whistles, except for the drink machine...which, by the way, appears to have several HUNDRED possible drink combinations. The decor looked like it has since I was a kid (p.s. a long time ago)...dated, to say the least. ...  ... Even driving up to the Yelp Event, I barely recognize the building. From the outside, you can see that there have been MAJOR renovations done. There are sleek, dark, tinted windows all along the roof line, coupled with ceiling to floor tinted windows surrounding the new seating area. ...  ... After checking out the Yelp table (and picking up a couple of "Here's The Beef" t-shirts), my family and I went in. ...  ... Upon passing through the second glass door, we were IMMEDIATELY lost. EVERYTHING had changed!  ...  ... The first thing that caught our attention was the all new seating area immediately to the left. There are two sets of two chairs facing one another, making for a rather intimate setting. Hung on the wall is a beautiful HDTV. But, the piece de resistance for the seating area was the faux fireplace. It was absolutely beautiful! ...  ... The overall decor has been completely modernized. The old, tired booths and seats have been replaced with updated seating. On top of the dividing walls, there are beautiful glass accents. Where there used to be boring run-of-the-mill booths on the left of the dining area, there is now a gorgeous "Arizona Room-esque" glass palace. Within this seating area, there is another, albeit smaller, HDTV hung in the corner. ...  ... Now, on to the service. I know there was a Yelp event going on, and you always put on a good show for company, but the management at this location really seem to have embraced the change that Wendy's is trying to make. Three different managers were walking throughout the dining area, greeting all of the customers, and handing out coupons for free things (burgers, fries, frosties, etc.). In fact, one of the managers offered to carry our food, and escorted us through the dining area to our seats. I know it's hard to get excited about the service at a fast food restaurant, but at least there's a ray of hope after today. ...  ... Based on what I saw, it looks like Wendy's is well on their way to righting the ship as far as their restaurants are concerned. I'm sure they spent a pretty penny on these upgrades. If they can keep up the great service, and ride the wave of the buzz created by these renovations, I'm sure they're going to see a FANTASTIC return on their investment! ...  ... Thank you to Lindsey and her team for making my first Yelp event an awesome one!

REVIEW #3:  3 stars  (201 chars)
If you have to eat fast food - do it in style. The nicest Wendy's I've ever seen in my life. No one goes to a fast food restaurant for the quality food. It's clean , modern and has a cool soda machine.

REVIEW #4:  3 stars  (1052 chars)
It's a Wendy's - they have square hamburgers and you can substitute Baked potatoes for fries, which should be available at all fast food places!  ...  ... A note on the sour cream for the potatoes: it is "reduced fat" sour cream. Ummm....cream, by definition is chock full of fat. If you reduce said fat I am not sure it qualifies as cream anymore... ...  ... Anyway - I just wanted to let people know that this location features the Freestyle Coca-Cola thingy if you are into all that. I had never heard of it before, and we were in the drive thru so we didn't really utilize its advertised capabilities of 100+ drink combinations.  ...  ... The drive thru features a snazzy video screen menu board, which probably cost them thousands but you still can't figure out what number a Junior Bacon Cheeseburger Meal is supposed to be.... ...  ... As for the food - my burger was warm when we got home, the potato was BIG and the lettuce/tomato on the burgers were fresh! The bacon was also delightfully crispy ( a rarity in a burger u don't make yourself).

REVIEW #5:  3 stars  (453 chars)
Where's the beef...? ...  ... I used to like Wendys. It was my go to for fast food. Everything just seems to be ok now. Nothing jumps out to remind me to eat here again.  ...  ... 1/4lb burger (before cooking) is now the size of a small JR burger and the JR burgers might as well be vegan. Seriously there was a spot on the bun where the meat should be. LOL ...  ... The Chili was great, the side salads were good.  ...  ... I think I am over fast food.

REVIEW #6:  1 stars  (455 chars)
I went to this location in the evening about 8:00pm, and orderd two double cheeseburgers. I ordered them with nothing on it, just cheese, and two fries. So it was too go, I get home and they gave me two pattys wirh mustard on them, and get this with no buns!!!! They had mustard which I did not ask for, I said plain, and they went as far as NO BUNS!! They only gave me one fries, I ordered two. So I will be going to Burger King or Mcdonalds from now on.

Let me start this by saying I am a mom of 2 young kids. Needless to say I don't have the biggest nightlife, because parenting at 6am with a hang over is just NOT worth it.  That being said I've never had cause to visit a Wendy's at 1:30am, until tonight. I've been up all night with my 6 year old son who is sick. I thought a frosty would soothe his throat and do just the trick to get him back to sleep, but all I got was a foomy version of one from them, plus shitty, cold food. If their food is going to suck at 1:30am, then don't be open that late.

REVIEW #9:  1 stars  (1064 chars)
Went to Wendy's on 7th St. and Greenway for breakfast with my wife. They opened at 7. We were there when the doors were open. Two gentleman were ahead of us. The restaurant had approx 8 employees.we stood for five minutes, the employees totally ignored us, one of the men left. The other asked if someone could help him, a employee looked at him, didn't say a thing, turned her back and walked away! The shift Manager looked at as and said," we'll be with you in a minute" Five more minutes went by and all the employees, and the shift manager still ignored us! We left! I eat at Wendy's all over the valley and generally the service is fast. Not at this location. The owners just went through a complete rebuild of the location and it looks great, but the service before the rebuild was horrible and that didn't seem to change, in fact it was the worse service I've ever had anywhere. If you are the owners of this location please do something about your poor attitudes of your employees and your management staff. Attitude is everything and it starts at the top.

One of the few fast food places that is always fast with breakfast.  Choice of biscuits, "fricuits", etc. are a nice alternative to other breakfast options from most of the competition.  Reasonable prices too.  Safe area.

REVIEW #4:  2 stars  (980 chars)
I like Wendy's and I think their food is generally better than the bunch, but this location is BAAAAD.  Don't get me wrong, the employees are friendly and try to be helpful, but there are two large problems with this location; the employees lack training and 50% of my orders come out wrong.   ...  ... Wendy's mails coupons to my home, and often this location hands out coupons with orders, but EVERY time I went to use a coupon at this location, they have no idea how to enter it.  They almost always say their don't have the button on their cash register for it, but I have to believe its poor training, or a complete lack of any training. ...  ... Second, at least 50% of the time, the order I get is wrong. At the drivethru I'm almost always missing at least one item which I don't discover until I get home.  In the store, items are wrong as well.  Again, lack of any training seems to be the problem, and a high employee turnover at this location also seems like a problem.

REVIEW #5:  2 stars  (860 chars)
I work in the same complex as this Wendy's, and with limited fast food around, I wind up here quite a bit for lunch. I've been at my job for the past four years. And let me tell you, this Wendy's has always been awful. The staff are far from friendly. I've stood at the registers while they chit chat near the back with not a care in the world. They look up, see me, and continue on talking.  ... The manager is the rudest manager I've ever encountered. The staff is monotone. There's a new worker every few weeks. They're always hiring, and now have signs all of the windows, doors, the counter where you order, and all over the table. They're desperate. And it shows in their work etiquette why they are so desperate for new workers.  ...  ...  ... The food, though? It's just like any other Wendy's. I personally prefer the location on Tatum & Bell, though.

REVIEW #6:  2 stars  (888 chars)
This is kind of a difficult review to write - which seems ridiculous as it is a standard fast food chain. When the food is fresh and the order is correct I would easily give this place four stars - and that is most of the time. their burgers beat down any other fast food place (save for In-N-Out). However, when the place is running behind or your fries are clearly the last of the last batch quality falls sharply. Also as much as I love their breakfast (again when its done correctly), I have had the wrong order come out twice and have to drive back around, had paper left on the cheese - and thusly on my sandwich and in my mouth (wtf?), etc. And as much as I wish it would be the success rate with breakfast is much lower in my experience. ALSO - avoid around lunch time - this place (inside and out) gets utterly ridiculous as there is a lack of other fast food places in the area.

REVIEW #7:  2 stars  (284 chars)
Used to get combos meals a lot, but lately I've only getting the food from the 99 cents menu.  All the hamburger portions are so tiny, don't really think it's worth the money eating here anymore.  Frosty drink is always good, no matter what size you get, I can never get enough of it.

REVIEW #8:  1 stars  (975 chars)
This location has fallen very far from the tree.  Absolutely awful service.  Hardly anyone was in the place, and the employees acted like it.  One of the employees walked around the entire place touching walls and surfaces and in general being abnoxious and even brooming the floor before he was about to serve us food WITHOUT WASHING HIS HANDS.  We watched him touch a dozen other surfaces and serve the drive through without washing his hands.  It took us much longer than usual to get our food.  All of the fries were mushy.  This location has gone down the toilet.  They were missing menu items and didn't tell us before our purchase.  We had to remind them of the price difference to get a refund.  I asked the cashier, "is that guy going to wash his hands, before he touched our food?"  The cashier told him to wash his hands, and then proceeded to handle our food despite having his fingers all over the register and everything else.  We will not be eating here again.

If it wasn't for their darn service, I'd give this 4, maybe even 5 stars! As far as fast food places go, Wendy's has pretty good food, but probably the worst service, and this one is not an exception. ...  ... I was at the airport a little hungry and looking for some fast food that would not scratch my throat. Maybe it was not the best choice, but I remember Wendy's baked potatoes with chili were nice and soft on the inside, almost mashed potato like in texture, so I got that. Well, when I sat down, I noticed instead of "baked potato with chili cheese" like I said, they gave me "chili cheese fries." I'm sorry, but how can you hear that incorrectly?!? The  person who took my order fulfilled my order, and that was literally the ONLY thing I got!! Plus, I'm always very cheery when interacting with others. I didn't even get a smile from him :( ...  ... So after scratching my throat with fries because I couldn't muster up the energy to go back, I'm typing this review on my phone. Don't get me wrong, the chili cheese fries were actually quite delicious if it wasn't for the constant coughing. Just be aware of going to this Wendy's (or ANY Wendy's) and make sure you check your order before you leave. That's something I keep forgetting to do... ...  ... By the way, I order the chili and cheese baked potato all the time at various Wendy's around the US. Half the time, I get bacon and cheese, and of course, this time I got fries. Also, half the time they actually do get my order right, the potato is all dry and NOT that lovely mashed potato texture I love. Talk about frustrating!

Atrocious service & failure to manage a simple breakfast selection of food.  Biscuits? Sorry, we're out for awhile.  Hashbrown potatoes? Sorry, we're out right now.  Fries? No we're out of those too.  So I order the panini breakfast sandwich without meat.  When I get to my gate, I see the sandwich is also lacking egg (meaning it's just the cheese & condiments on it).  Brilliant folks working here... brilliant!

What a horrible experience. Besides the food being totally awful, the 'manager' on duty was rude to every employee working.  The cashier (Almaz) was very nice, and pleasant. Immediately after I placed my order, the manager yelled to her 'dont take any more orders and go take lunch'.  ... Then the phone rang, and the manager answered it 'Mike, i've got a line and cant talk' and promptly hung up. ...  ... Now, they appeared to have a new employee working the other register. After the rude manager gave me my order, he went over and pulled a basket of fries out of the fryer. I was trying to get their attention to get some ketchup and she proceeded to yell at him for pulling the fries and then told him to help me. She then proceded to pull the fries out of the 'serve bin' and dump them back into the fryer. ...  ... One customer (as i was walking away) made a comment to the manager "perhaps if you were a little nicer to them they'd listen better" (referring to how she was treating the  employees). ...  ... It would have been nice if they provided salt/ketchup without having to ask - but the point is moot as I will NEVER go to this location again. I'll eat at the pizza place next door or the Paradise bakery down the hall. I have never tried them, but they have to be more professional and have better food. ...  ... STAY AWAY!!

Every great once in a while I'll have a craving for a triple burger from Wendy's. This hasn't resulted in a heart attack yet, so I'll try and keep this craving to once or twice a year. But, I have to say, this is the best fast food burger out there, and although I wouldn't want you to make a habit of eating like this, I do recommend it... Once or twice a year!

Oh, finally a Wendy's with some decency!  I've eaten here at this location on and off for the past few years, and today was no different. I was on the way to the Arabian Horse show at Westworld, and my stomach was grumblng-loudly ...  ... I came in here to have an early lunch before I headed into the event. This place over the years has always been one of my favorite locations because their always consistent.  Food is hot and ready, staff is friendly and the dining area's always clean.   ...  ... Today I went with the combo # 1, and it was out in no time.  Bathrooms were well stocked and clean, and the condiment's were well stocked. I will say I like this location more then others. Kind of buried in the shopping center, but its clean and nice just about every single time I go here.  Oh, and their new breakfast's?  AWESOME!

Quick drive thru if you are on a lunch break, nice staff.  Went at an off time for a small fry and small frosty since I was hungry and needed a snack (~2 p.m.).  Fries were hot and tasted fresh and the frosty was delicious as always. ...  ... Parking lot is poorly designed, so it can back up into the main road, which blocks traffic flow and irritates other drivers.  It can also block you into a parking spot in their already rather small private parking lot and you will need to wait for a kind driver to not move forward in the line for you to be able to back out.  I would recommend parking in the lot close by and walking over to avoid this dilemma!

Never consistent.  ...  ... I was in twice this week. On my first visit I ordered a potato, chicken nuggets and a kids size frosty. I paid at the first window and when I reached the second they tried to collect money from me, when I informed her I already paid at the first window she asked if I was sure that I already paid. I wasn't OK with her implying I was lying about paying for my lunch. After all that confusion they handed me my lunch, told me to have a nice day and I drove away. One I got about 10 feet ahead I realized they never handed me my frosty but at this point it was too late. A car was already at the window and since it's lunch time the parking lot was a disaster and I wasn't going back.  ...  ... My second visit was yesterday, I ordered a kids meal but it didn't have a toy inside. While this isn't a huge deal to me since it was for myself. But, if I had a kid in the back seat waiting on a toy, I'd be pretty upset.  ...  ... In previous visits I'm usually missing an item 2 out of 5 times. Whether it's butter for my potato, dressing for my salad or a straw for my drink.

Although the food itself was good and the restaurant appeared to be clean, the service was seriously lacking! Not a single person acknowledged my existence and I had to step up to the counter and ask if I could order. I never saw a single smile from any employee either.

As far as national fast food chains go - Wendy's is one of the better ones. I appreciate that you can get a salad instead of fries here. Their burgers usualy seem fresher and better tasting too. However, this location appears to be one of the worst run Wendy's I've ever been to. My salad not cold, was wilted, and had lots of brown bits. Service was far from enthusiastic.

REVIEW #4:  1 stars  (625 chars)
Just left this place and I'm very unsatisfied with there service. First it took the cashier 15mins to understand what I was ordering and another 10 to get my order into the register. Then I was frustrated because I could not understand his broken English. Then after that he does not give me my change back as if he does not owe it to me. When I asked for my change, he then try's to give me less then what he owed me. I have no problems with any race of people! All I ask is that you hire and train people to do there jobs. And please make sure your workers can communicate with your customers or they will stop coming back!

Not sure how my Frosty melted from the time it came out of the machine to when it was handed to me at the drive thru window 20 seconds later. Always feel the need to try new fast food products and the Waffle Cone had been on the short list for awhile. Your not missing anything with this semi-stale cone and then the old reliable Frosty (vanilla) was a disgrace at this location. Unless it was 109 inside the store, that ice cream should not have melted. Waffle Cone was only $1.69, but I'm going back to the Frosty in a cup with the spoon that usually sticks straights up and I won't be getting it at this sorry location.

This is the worst Wendy's ever- and I LOVE Wendys. I hate that this is the location closest to my work... But it never fails, you mess up something in my order EACH time! You would think they would get tired of the complaint calls and giving away free food to replace it, b/c I know I am tired of wasting my lunch time doing so!  ... Educate your staff on Gluten free and gluten allergies (ie your bread! When someone asks for a bunless sandwich, it needs to have lettuce wraped around it...essp when the customer said to wrap it in lettuce!) Also educate your staff on what condiments come with a baked potatoe. That is really getting old. The salt/pepper/butter/sour cream has always been part of the potato order.  ...  ... Just the worst and this is just the tip of the ice burg......... They didn't reply to my email of complaint last month... maybe a Yelp review would help.

Wow.  This seriously can not be the first review for this Wendy's location!?!? ...  ... Anyway....Wendy's is your traditional fast food joint.  With square hamburger patties and Frosty's.    They're pretty much all the same.   ...  ... EXCEPT....I do not like a side of scabs, sores, and blistered fingers and arms with my fries.  Thank you.  Went through the drive-through to grab lunch.  Was hankering for a frosty-fry combination. It's the sweet / salty thing.   ...  ... I ordered.  Drove up to the first window and paid.  Then drove to the second window to pick up my food.  I did a double take at the guys hands and arms that was manning the second window.  Some sores scabbed over.  Some looked like they were weeping.  But it was a blistered nasty mess.  Like he had his hands shoved in the fryer a week or so prior and they were healing.  VOMIT!!  I was so digusted in fact that I immediately tossed my food away when I got back to work.   ...  ... Wether he touched my food or not, did not matter.  Just the pure thought of him possibly touching my food was enough to make me toss everything in the trash.  ...  ... DRY HEAVE!!

This review is specifically for an employee named David. He is not only efficient and friendly, but took such good care of everyone who came into his store ...  ... The stand out moment was an older woman with a walker ordering some lunch. David took her order. Walked her to a seat and offered to bring her her tray. On top of that he brought her mustard and ketchup and came by to refill her drink.  He had consistent people trying to order but took time for the elderly. David if I had any cash I would has tipped you and made sure you really understand that your efforts do not go unnoticed. Thank you for going above and beyond!!

Inside or outside?...Soup or salad?...Cheese or no cheese?...Blondes or Brunettes? ...  ... We all have our preferences and I am no different. ...  ... I have never had a relationship with a redhead go smoothly and Wendy is not an exception:( ...  ... She's never really been good to me, although she's occasionally surprised me with something fun and spicy (like a deep fried spicy chicken sandwich that will set your mouth on fire:) ...  ... But in the end, she's always been a bit of a disappointment...for a lot of reasons. ...  ... Wendy whispers sweet nothings in my ear...things like "always fresh, never frozen" and "made when you order it", yet the burgers are always dripping with moisture and grease...clearly partially cooked and then waiting in a bin next to the grill:( ...  ... Wendy always asks me "how do you want it?"...so coquettish...so provocative...so beguiling! ...  ... And yes... I do tell her how I want it...and she nearly always gets it wrong...clumsily...inconsiderately...often incoherently and unpleasantly wrong:( ...  ... I tell her she needs to make it right...and she makes an attempt to satisfy...but I can tell her heart isn't in it:( ...  ... I vow that I will not darken her door again, but then I find myself in a tight spot where Wendy is the only one that has what I need...right there...right then...and I succumb. ...  ... That was the situation last week...busy, busy, so very busy, last week! ...  ... Hard workout...needed a retoxing...almost late for a meeting...empty drive through lane at Wendy's... ...  ... Well, you can guess the rest yourself...no need for me to go into the sordid details...except to say that maybe I've gotten a little bit smarter about this crazy redhead...This time, I didn't pull out until I got exactly what I wanted:)  ...  ... Pull out of the drive through...of the drive through...what did you think I meant?

Was looking for a fast meal the other day and stopped by this location for lunch.  I didn't want a large meal and didn't have time to sit down and eat a Salad, so I ordered a Chocolate Oreo Frosty & Large Fries, ha! ...  ... What a great combo.....the Fries were OK and the Chocolate Oreo Frosty was awesome!  I really wanted the regular Oreo Frosty, but they were out of Vanilla.....minus 1 Star for that.  I was full after this meal, that's all that mattered. ...  ... Return Factor - 40%

Try harder, please. ...  ... This used to be a great location. The food was always put together with care, it was hot, the chicken juicy.  Now, we get attitude from the staff, nasty attitude from the younger staff, the chicken tastes rubbery, the fries were almost raw, and they left us sitting in the parking lot waiting for them to bring out our drive-thru order. I finally had to go in and they had totally forgotten about us.  They tried to give us our cold food and I made them make it fresh.  I was SO not please.

REVIEW #6:  1 stars  (170 chars)
Whenever I get my food- it's cold! I don't know why I ever go there?! I keep hoping it'll turn around- like the others. This is expressly a Frosties Only location for me.

I have to give these guys a high mark for trying hard to please customers!! They always send customers through the drive through in record time. Wendy's gives seniors a great deal, too. Now they are even redecorating and I can't wait to see the results. If only they would do something about the smell inside. It is awful. Please fix it, guys!!!

REVIEW #6:  2 stars  (498 chars)
Seems like this location specializes in rude or non-caring workers.  I've been totally ignored at the window while the cashier just talked to his friend non-stop, basically throwing my change back at me.  I've had them rudely asked "Didn't you read the sign??" when their card machine was not working, but the sign had been poorly taped and fell off. ...  ... The food at least is usually mostly fresh, though on occasion they like to serve up cold/old fries. ...  ... I try to avoid this location.

There's something wrong with this chain.  It's gone downhill fast over the past several years.

The food was bland and was poor quality.  When you compare the price of the Double Stack to a McDouble, it's more expensive too....so where's the value?  There is none. ...  ...

REVIEW #10:  1 stars  (864 chars)
I've had the worst experience at this Wendy's.  I could do a long rant but I'll make this short. ...  ... 1) My 5 year old was served a RAW cheeseburger.  They walked this cow right through the damn kitchen. ... 2) Only one employee seemed to speak enough English for me to attempt to complain. ... 3) The ONLY thing I was given in compensation was a free kiddie frosty.  The manager (wherever they were hiding) didn't even come out to apologize. ...  ... The employees were too busy doing a chant for Obama than to worry about actually doing there jobs.  While I don't care who they wanted for president, it's a bit disturbing that this was okay with management. ...  ... If my son gets sick, I promise you that compensation will not be just a frosty.  I've worked near here for over 10 years and it used to be good but it has really gone downhill over the years.

REVIEW #11:  1 stars  (715 chars)
Must be the A-Team works after 10pm because this place was horrible.  I ordered 2 chicken sandwiches, and cheeseburger with fries at the drive-through and was immediately put off by this place.  I asked the guy if I could have a second to think about my order and he seemed to think that this was a major inconvenience to him when he stated "whatever" after I asked. Once I got home I opened the bag to eat my food.  I found that they had only given me one chicken sandwich(I realize I should've checked before I drove off, but I assumed they knew how to count).  Then I took out my cheeseburger and fries only to find out that they were pretty much frozen, awesome.  So, I will definitely not be coming here again.

So me and the Mr are knee deep in guest room remodeling. So tonight we were going to have Bo Kho (Beef Stew, Vietnamese Style) but I fell asleep and didn't get it started in time to eat at a decent hour.  ...  ... So on our way back from (another) trip to Home Depot we decided just to grab a burger. Now mind you I haven't eaten fast food for years.. I remember Wendy's having a delicious juicy burger, piping hot and yummy! Well to my surprise when I found that they didn't have my 1/4 double stack any longer but some little piece of shit called a Burger Buster, or something.. Well it sure the hell was, they busted the burger right out of that shit.. it wasn't burger but perhaps some dirt and belly button lint held together with some sort of emulsifier. This thing wasn't juicy nor tasty.. just cheap and nasty! ...  ... You know what? Someone should punch that little red head bitch in the face!

Just recently stopped off on my way home from work, called mama if she wanted anything for lunch? So she thought be a good idea to get Wendy's. ... I ordered Three cheeseburgers, order of chicken nuggets, and two large fries. I had the nuggets, it was ok. Not great? I would rather have them at chick fl'a instead. Girls had no problem mowing down the burgers, including the wife. Fries were actually good, forgot to tell them no salt. But it wasn't that much salt anyways.  ... I like how the location use to be a bank, neat how the reconfigured it to make it work. Even though we have tried to stay away from fast foods, Wendy's was a nice change.

REVIEW #3:  1 stars  (439 chars)
Don't eat here. 16 min stuck in drive through and once there is a car or two behind you your stuck for the whole crazy trip. 16 min two combos, I left with three large fries and a horrible tasting Chibatta burger, could not eat it. Also ordered a hamburger with no cheese and only ketchup.  I asked them to check to see if it had cheese on it and it did. So they replaced it with a large fries. Stay away. No big deal just pass this place.

REVIEW #5:  1 stars  (1421 chars)
They literally got every single part of my order wrong except for the drink.   ...  ... I drove through about 15 minutes before close.  Not unreasonably last minute.  But everything looked shut down.  I ordered a burger with no bun because I have a wheat intolerance.  Right away the person taking my order seemed baffled.  "No fries?"  "No, no bun."  Ok.  I tried to order a broccoli cheese potato because I know some Wendy's have this or use to have it, but they said they only had sour cream and chive or chili cheese.  No problem, I'll take chili cheese.  Then  a Jr. chocolate frosty.    ...  ... The first thing he handed me was the frosty.  It was vanilla.  I had to wait until the order was finished about 5 minutes later before I was able to speak to him again and request a chocolate instead.  Then I glanced in my bag of food and the burger  clearly had a bun.  Okay I can't just remove the bun, because just the contact with the burger is enough for a reaction.  But honestly I was too afraid to ask them to remake it because by this time they were about 5 minutes till close and I was afraid they'd spit in it or something.  I'll just give it to my husband and the potato will be my dinner.  Then I got back to my hotel, got out the potato (with no fork or utensil) and it was a CHIVE potato.  No chili or cheese.  Just a dry potato with chives.  There wasn't even any sour cream on it or in the bag.  Great.

This location appears to have all new staff and a new face lift because we have had few issues in the past couple of months.

Their two star review is not surprising at all.  ...  ... Good service and fast food is somewhat of an oxymoron, however, this is just unacceptable. I stopped in for lunch today, get away from the office for a few and have a chicken sammy, their spicy chicken sandwich is really good.  ...  ... 1. No greeting or smile from any single staff member.  ... 2. There were a few people in line waiting to be helped, took a few moments, as apparently it takes three employees to read an order ticket and pour a coke.  ... 3. It took almost 10 minutes for my turn in a line of 4 people.  ... 4. Ever single table was a mess and chair all over the place. ... 5. My food was practically thrown at me, and minus the sauces that I requested.  ... 6. And I am pretty sure he sour puss behind the counter scowled at me as I rolled my eyes in disgust at what was going on.  ...  ... It's hard to disappoint at a fast food establishment, as I am sure we are all going in with pretty low expectations to begin with, but honestly, just a hello and smile would have made a world of difference here.

Do yourself a favor and avoid this place if you can. I stopped and I was the only one there. I should have known. Every table was dirty. Kind of disgusting actually. I ordered my meal. 8 bucks and some change. my burger was dry but better than raw I guess. My frys were burnt so bad I took them back. I waited and waited and no one noticed me. FINALLY someone helped me. By the time I got new frys my burger was almost done. This location is the old style where they still give you your drink. it needs a makeover BALDLY. THE girls who served me were nice enough... no issues there. They just need some SERIOUS help.

Wendy's should NOT allow this location to operate!  I pulled up to the drive-thru tonight and a young girl on the speaker asked if I could wait.  I waited about four minutes while two cars pulled up behind me..and waited.  Finally, I ordered.  I could barely understand the girl through the speaker, but I managed.  I rolled up to the window and the girl took the orders for those behind me--very efficient, actually.  Then a rather large middle aged woman came up to the window and the girl disappeared.  I watched through the window as a middle-aged man watched french fries fry.  The transaction went well (they took my money just fine).  Then I pulled into the parking lot to eat my food--I really only treat myself to Wendy's once every month or so, but it has to be HOT. ...  ... My burger was warm but dry and squished.  Oh well.  I was looking forward to my fries and I was so excited when I pulled them out of the bag to see that they were overcooked--I love my fries crispy but rarely request this.  Then I ate the first fry and spat it out--it must have been an old fry that was sitting at the side of the fryer.  Then I ate another...sure enough, the reason the fries were well done is because the man at the fryer had taken COLD OLD fries and put them back into the fryer to re-warm them!  DISGUSTING!  I threw them out. ...  ... This is actually the fourth bad experience at this Wendy's location..out of four.  AVOID, AVOID, AVOID!  No doubt they're having staffing and other issues, they're DISGUSTING!  Oh, but at least my order was "correct" this time--the trick to getting your order right is to only order three items. ...  ... I'm now waiting for the food poisoning to hit.  This location obviously has no idea as to how to handle food properly.

I usually like Wendy's. I think that have some great burgers and who doesn't like a chocolate frosty. I really think it is just this location. Somehow the service is never that great and the food just isn't up to par with other locations. ...  ... The last time I was here, which will probably be the last time I am there, I had to wait quite awhile for my food. They managed to finally get half of it ready but were still having trouble getting the burger I ordered together. They finally got it together and I left to go back to work to eat where I discovered after all of that they gave me the wrong sandwich. Make me wait and still get it wrong. Boooooo. ...  ... At some point I will go back to Wendy's but never to this location. I will gladly drive the 2 extra miles to go to the one on Baseline.

I usually love Wendy's but i have had an encounter with the manager and he was straight up rude. And today I went around 950 am to get some food and according to their website Wendy's open at 7 am and I sat in the drive thru for 5 min and no one said that they were closed or asked me if I want anything. There was 4 cars parked out front so I am sure there were people in side. Now i called later in the day to get clarification on when they open, and the phone rang for 2 min... At 130 in the afternoon. I am very disappointed.

So Emily at the PUW couldn't answer my question about a salad that was on the menu so she says "just a sec" and then disappears without any explanation.  Then a young man continues the conversation.  I ask the weight of the salad and he tells me "just a minute."  He comes back and tells me they aren't a set amount, they all vary.  I inquired about the type of apples on one of the salads and I'm told red and green. ... I'm tired of ordering food and the employees knowing nothing about what they're selling.  No clue how many ounces in the beverages, no idea the weight of meat on a sandwich or what toppings are on it so they have to put you on 'hold" so they can ask someone else. ... I accept this lack of info, complete my order, pay, and as I begin to drive off I observe two guys and at least one girl finding this situation particularly humorous. ... So the (clueless) customer is funny now? ...  ... Bleu cheese on my salad was warm which seems strange. ... Thanks for making my dining experience after a long day of volunteering, painting, and then yardwork a pleasant end of the day.

REVIEW #6:  1 stars  (529 chars)
Terrible Service.  ... My family and I stopped into the Wendy's after picking up out of town relatives from the airport. The manager was quite rude to each of us as we ordered then had the nerve to tell us to eat quick because the lobby was closing early. We arrived at 8:15pm and he said he could keep the lobby open until 8:35pm. Granted this is no 5 star restaurant but to honestly tell customers they have a time limit on their meal is preposterous, especially when you arrive well before the closing time marked on the door.

Yeah, I know, it's a Wendy's. What should I expect? ...  ... How about at least getting *something* right on my order? You know, *anything*. ...  ... I order a grilled chicken sandwich, large fries, and a large chocolate frosty. The person at the counter says, "$2.13".  ...  ... Hey, I'm all for a great discount, but given that the frosty pushes two bucks alone, something was amiss. ...  ... No translator was available, but we managed to figure out she'd charged me for the 99 cent "crispy chicken" sandwich, no fries and a small frosty. ...  ... So she re-rang it, correctly I assumed. ...  ... I get my bag o' food, and she plops down not a frosty, but a soft drink. Whatever, I'm kinda in a hurry, so I just grabbed it and left. This is after all, "fast food", I was freaking starving and just wanted to get out. ...  ... In the car I find I got not a chicken sandwich, but a hamburger. And not large fries, but a small order. ...  ... The burger was, Wendy's. The fries, Wendy's. The soda, diet (which I think tastes like feet). ...  ... I've eaten a LOT of fast food in my time, but I don't recall ever having EVERYTHING wrong.

This place is a dump, and it's staffed by the indolent.  It's filthy; they're slow.  Go someplace that stands a chance of having been cleaned and swept at least sometime in the prior week and where the people "serving" you speak English with a smile.

Exciting news people! For years Wendy's has been serving bland tasteless dry burgers and horrible fries. My husband has a certain fondness for them, but he had always been forced to eat at Wendy's without me because I couldn't tolerate crappy fast food.  ...  ... This all changed recently when Las Vegas became THE test market for the entire country for Dave's new Hot and Juicy burger and natural cut fries with sea salt. Yup, in many parts of the country they still are serving those dry tasteless burgers but not here my friends.... ...  ... The new burger is the real deal. It IS hot and juicy and really great for a fast food burger. I don't get why it's so juicy and moist, but it is somehow. They also have nice new fresh veggies (apparently crinkle cut pickles are a big deal? and red onions?) and a new improved bun with BUTTER ON IT. Oh hell yes. If I'm eating 50 grams of fat damnit give me a couple more. The fries are much improved as well !  ...  ... If you must slum it at Wendy's for whatever reason, have no fear, the food is finally decent !

I usually come here when I crave a chocolate frosty & fries!  ...  ... I love their frosty, it makes me smile just even thinking about it. Fond memories. ... Drive-thru is quick and efficient. I am usually in & out of the place in a few minutes.  When I do want more food items other than a frosty, I would usually order the kids chicken nuggets meal & it has everything but smaller and a cheaper price.   ...  ...

Everytime I go to this place (usually I go after 10) the people that give you your food are always rude and never give you what you're paying for. The two men that take your order are always nice (older gentleman and African American man). When I got my frostys (best part about Wendy's) they were only half way full and instead of the young man filling them the rest of the way up he argued with me that that's how they do them even though every other time I get them and he's not there they are filled all the way! Terrible customer service most of the time. I would not recommend going to this location. After my visit tonight I don't think I will be returning to this location! HORRIBLE.

REVIEW #7:  1 stars  (1857 chars)
I have really tried to give this location the benefit of the doubt but NO MORE! ... This is the 5th time (yes, 5th) I have given the Eastern location a chance. I thought maybe they had an off day or even an off month?? ...  ... Though the interior is on point, they are lacking in the very place that needs to shine. ... The food quality is absolutely horrendous. Every time I have ordered any kind of burger the middle is pink and even RED. I didn't know fast food restaurants could cook their burgers at different temperatures (sarcasm)! And whenever I have mentioned it to the manager and staff they seem uninterested and like it's MY FAULT.  ...  ... Enter today's visit, which was from the pick-up window: ...   ... On my order was the 4 piece nuggets, a double stack, a frosty and a strawberry lemonade. First the nuggets were NOT cooked all the way through because they were jelly like and the breading was very light in color, as if they took them out of the oil WAY too fast. The double stack meat tasted old and the bun was very hard and unpleasant. The frosty was rancid and I had to throw it away, not even 2 scoops I took. And the worst part was the strawberry lemonade! It was GROSS, and extremely watered down. I've seen the process of the drink and it's not rocket science. How hard is it to put strawberry puree, ice and lemonade into a drink??!!  ...  ... NEVER EVER going back! The staff needs to be RE-TRAINED or taught some common sense. Maybe the staff is too young? Or the management is not doing a good job hiring employees. Something needs to be done to fix the problems. Not only is this bad for the company but bad on the consumer who WILL get sick if things aren't fixed.  ...  ... Next time, don't worry so much about having a fireplace in your establishment and worry more about the food quality and service standards, Wendy's!

Being a fan of the $2.99 crispy chicken deluxe, which comes out to $3.87 when I upsize to medium, I made it a lunch stop. It served its purpose by filling me up at an inexpensive price. ...    On my visit here, the service was fine. The restaurant was also clean.

You can't go wrong when you need something quick to eat from Wendy's.  I'm definitely a fan of their value menu!  I like their crispy chicken sandwich.  Their salads are wonderful too.  During the cooler months, I always go for their chili.  When I can't think of where to go and need to grab something fast...Wendy's is staple!  My husband loves this place too!  Especially their burgers and frosty's.

When they had the crispy chicken deluxe meal for $2.99, I'd eat here. Recently Wendy's bean counters got greedy and eliminated it. Good move in a recession.

REVIEW #5:  2 stars  (501 chars)
I walked into this location wearing a parka and was absolutely freezing.  The thermostat at the counter read 63 when I went to place my order.  My husband and I asked the employee if there was any way they could raise it a few degrees - I saw other people in the dining room with their jackets and hats still on.  The woman said "it's not up to us, corporate does it."   ...  ... On another note, our fries were cold.  Maybe that's just because the place itself was freezing.   ...  ... Won't be back.

I work pretty close by this wendys and every time I go there they always get my order wrong and the food is never fresh. It's disappointing .

REVIEW #7:  1 stars  (794 chars)
About the worst experience I have ever had eating out. First, they forgot about our order and we had to wait 10 minutes for what should have been a 3 minute wait tops for the size of order we had. Second, they made our goodly completely wrong. Third, they were extremely rude and not attentive to our needs at all, and four they were laughing about the whole ordeal and taking it as some kind of a joke. Every customer I saw in there while we were there had the same exact issues. It's no wonder that this location is so slow. Tables were left dirty, food not up to par with any Wendy's I have ever had, just a disappointment all around. The only reasonable thing that they did for us was give us the corporate number so that we can call and let them know. Completely a disgrace to the company.

REVIEW #8:  1 stars  (1666 chars)
Rude service x2. I went through the drive thru, and my inlaws were behind me. Now, those people will annoy the bejesus out of anyone, including myself, but theres never any excuse for rude service. And thats what both of us got.  ...  ... My transaction went like this: i pulled up to the drivethru and tried to place my order. The guy kept getting my order wrong - at the speaker. Suddenly the voice changed to a female one - with attitude. Then i pulled up to the window, where they THREW my food at me. I kid you not. So then i thought id better check the order. As i was doing so, an employee said, again with ATTITUDE, "can i help you miss?" I said "just checking my order", with a big smile, and pulled away. But not before i overheard a manager (in manager clothes) say "just rush this line thru".  I thought, how rude, then i parked and waited for my inlaws.  ...  ... THEY pulled up to the window, my mother in law proceeded to order, and was told she "sounds like a robot". She replied "maybe its your machine."  They then told her "weve had this machine for years and have never had a problem." I couldnt BELIEVE this.  ...  ... I looked back at an old check in i had here where the manager (bigset female with attitude galore) had a big attitude before and had said, within my earshot , "get these people outta my drivethru!" ...  ... Tell ya what, lady - it aint YOUR drivethru. And Ive been coming to thos wendys because its convenient (wait a minute. Getting into this locations a nightmare). I dont think im ever coming back.  ...  ... And if you dont want attitude, abuse, the wrong order, or god knows what done to your food, Id recommend the same.

REVIEW #9:  1 stars  (694 chars)
This location is nothing but problems, every time I go to this store I'm treated bad, and the food is terrible and always burned or raw, when you address the issues with the food they say bring it back, well I told them I've got to goto work they said well bring the chicken and the receipt the next day I said what am I going to do with the food in the mean while she said well you got a fridge right? wow really never again, the manager called me from that store even after I specifically asked the 800 number to have a district manager call she said I can come into the store for a free replacement however i'm not going to because I'm afraid they might do something to the replacement food.

REVIEW #10:  1 stars  (268 chars)
What the f@$ I went to get some of the pretzel hamburgers they are advertising and after making us wait for their service we got told the don't have pretzel buns....if your advertising something and promoting it it's supposed for u to have them available....lame store

Today was probably the best drive thru experience that I have ever had. The woman working today was so polite! I almost died of shock!. Can't go wrong with the chilli, spicy chicken nuggets and a small .99 frosty! Lunch cost me $5.05 today.

REVIEW #3:  3 stars  (1212 chars)
Wendy's has improved their quality of late and this location has made it onto our short list of "fail-safe" weekend or late night food options.  ...  ... Speed: Typically faster than most Wendy's locations, with 2 out of 10 times I have to pull forward to wait for my food.  ... Attention to detail: Beware, this location has an issue with drink cup lids coming off because they didn't press them on and make sure they're on.  ... Service: Why yes, I want to order fries and apple slices with the kids meal. This location asks more than the rest if I'm sure. Yes I'm sure, I asked for it, I have a debit card in hand, do you not want to take my money? Repeat after me: french fries and a side of apple slices. See, that wasn't so hard now was it?  ... Cleanliness: When you look in the drive through window the place doesn't look like a shrine to lard like some places do. (Including the Wendy's at Marks and Sunset which just looks icky). ...  ... I usually use the drive through, the inside seating area is typically clean but it's also dated and in serious need of a refresh.  ...  ... Overall 3 Stars: Since we don't have Chick-Fil-A here, if you like a spicy chicken sandwich you make do with what you have.

REVIEW #4:  1 stars  (167 chars)
Their drive thru service at night is horrible. The lady was being rude to us and gave us hard chicken nuggets that were like rocks. I'm never going back to that place.

REVIEW #5:  1 stars  (335 chars)
Ugh. So disappointed.  ...  ... My guy went and got spicy chicken nuggets, frosty's , fries and a cod sandwich. ...  ... When he got home, the chicken peices were as hard as a rock, with absolutely no flavor. I've never had a problem with Wendy's.. I'm pretty shocked. ...  ... The fries were just meh. Not crispy enough for my liking.

I am a fan of the medium size crispy chicken deluxe extra value. At $3.87 it is a bargain. So, usually when I head north and I am in the Wendy's mood I.ll dine here. ...  There is plenty of parking. The restaurant is never packed.

REVIEW #2:  3 stars  (356 chars)
It is fast food, so you can't expect a 'true' healthy meal. However, they are pretty efficient even when it is lunch hour especially near a school. And they do accept the coupons that you get in the mail so even better! More savings for those who are on a budget. Always love the frosty and their chili. That's probably the only things I ordered from them.

REVIEW #3:  2 stars  (340 chars)
The only reason for 2 stars is because I like their food. Service was slow and the employees would step away from the register for several minutes at a time before taking orders. When their was a problem with a customer there was a scramble to try to fix it and a lot of confusion. Would recommend different Wendy's locations over this one.

REVIEW #4:  1 stars  (1268 chars)
I LOVE Wendy's. I do. It's awesome. Not this one though. There is a reason why this one is never busy. And I have tried. OVER and OVER. Because I just love their food...when it is right. ...  ... Every time we go, EVERY TIME, our order gets messed up. It is to the point where every other time our meal is free. My boyfriend went through and got one thing, an M and M chocolate frosty. Guess what he got? An oreo frosty. O.o If we order sandwiches with no sauce, we get extra sauce and no bacon or cheese. It is a different worker every time, their turnover rate is crazy so we know it is not us.  ...  ... They have some weird system that they have to beat a time for people to drive up. Once my boyfriends car was almost hit by the girl swinging garbage out of the window to fool the timer. She thought it was funny that his car almost got hit. Last time I went the guy was swinging the dustpan and broom out.  ...  ... This is a great location, and would do awesome business if they would get their act together. Maybe they need new management, because it can't be the workers fault every time. You have to train your employees properly, and give them tools for success, which every person who works there can't be lacking without some incompetence from management.

REVIEW #5:  1 stars  (395 chars)
Its been a few months so I thought I'd give them another shot. Weelll although there were six different sauces rung on my ticket...my total in bag net was zero. I also was charged for two salads when I ordered one.  ...  ... I ran in to get sauce and just told the lady the extra salad rather than wait for a refund.  ...  ... Got home to no croutons for salad.  ...  ... D:    gah. Never again.

REVIEW #6:  1 stars  (504 chars)
Just got totally ripped off at the drive-thru.  Ordered a half salad and a medium drink.  Got charged for a chili, burger + premium drink with extra shot of flavor and extra cheese on the chili. ... Thought the price was high, but was crunched for time and don't have the ability to go back for several hours to complain.  At that point, and even now, it will be my word against worker as to what I ordered.  Although I did receive exactly what I asked for, rather than the food reflected on the receipt.

This wendys is your standard wendy's but has one of the fastest drivethru's i have ever expereienced.  They work fast there.  The food was the standard fair.  Good burgers.  Fair fries.  The chicken nuggets I got were a little dry last time, but I go here so often, that seemed to be a fluke.

Whenever I want fast food at a reasonable price, I will go to Wendy's and order a crispy chicken deluxe meal medium size. For less than $4, I enjoy a tasty meal that fills me up. I also appreciate that I could choose my side. ...   I also notice that the employees working here are personable.  ...   And the restaurant is spacious and clean. If you want bang for your buck, I recommend the crispy chicken deluxe value meal medium size.

REVIEW #8:  3 stars  (496 chars)
I don't understand why they eliminated their $2.99 crispy chicken deluxe meal and if I am correct, raised the price on fries in the middle of a recession. I do understand that it has alienated customers, such as myself. ...   Recently I had been eating here so frequently that I became the duke of this Wendy's. The employees are friendly and the dining area is generally clean. ...   I have lowered the rating by a star. Eliminating a good deal during a recession lowers my opinion of the place.

REVIEW #9:  3 stars  (221 chars)
quick drive thru. drive thru kind of weird when its get crowded, its like two different lines from two different entry ways. Sometimes may be missing something from my salad, but pretty solid as far as Wendy's go. *shrug*

REVIEW #10:  3 stars  (445 chars)
The employees make your order as soon as they hear it at the register. This makes orders go by pretty quick when it's a pretty small to decent order. Otherwise, a large order backs up the line far too much. ... Most of the employees there look really unhappy and I've witnessed arguements and even fighting, yes literal fist fights, between employees. The food is great usual, it's just the staff can really make or break the dinning experience.

REVIEW #13:  1 stars  (482 chars)
I got food poisoning at this location a couple of years ago after eating the chili. Within hours I was vomiting and end up on IV fluids. I called Wendy's corporate office to alert them of the issue. They did absolutely nothing for me and basically told me I had no proof. Eventually I found out from a Wendy's employee that they use the un-sellable hamburger meet in the chili. I'm not surprised. The chili is the worst item on the menu, over-cooked to mask the taste of stale meat.

REVIEW #14:  1 stars  (1151 chars)
I went to Wendy's and my hamburger was raw!  Every time I go to this one, they mess up something on the order.  I know it's fast food but come on.  I don't even go to the other Wendy's in the area because they are so bad. There is always an army back there and some how they can't get an order right.   ...  ... This Wendy's location has this women that works the register that is Russian?  (Sorry if I may be mistaken.)  This lady has to be one of the rudest fast food employees I have ever seen.  I wish I could say she is a nice lady and blah blah blah,  but I am just being honest.  I always call her the "Hamburger Nazi!"  She just yells at you with no smile; "For here or to go!"  I'm not sure if it is a cultural thing or what.  At least the burn outs in other places smile.  I get nervous every time I order.  I have to spout out the order very fast and she cuts you off.  Go see for yourself, She is there everyday!  I've even got her in the drive-thru a few times.   ...  ... I wish Dave was still alive because Wendy's was so much better back in the day.  I hope I don't get this lady in trouble.  I just want to tell her to relax.  Cheers!

This is the worst wendys i have ever been to in my LIFE, food is ussally sloppy and kinda cold, there is a older pale woman who works the drive threw who is very rude and ive been there couple times she is always in abad mood and rude to everyone, She gets upset when i asked for 2 ketchups she told me last time that the new ketchup packs are 3 in 1, so i told her i understand i want 2 of those she looked at me and put 1 in the bag and closed the window.. so i waited there honking my horn finally someone else came up and gave me my damn ketchup, i tried to contact headquaters on this lady she is the reason why wendys lost my buisness, on top of all that one day i was in the drive threw one of the workers was by the trashcan taking a piss in broad daylight.. cant even imagine what they do behind closed doors

Always a good experience at this location. It's renovated and the dining room and even bathrooms (atypical for a fast food joint) are very clean. The service is usually quick with no issues. The asian cashew chicken salad is surprisingly delicious and crave worthy for a fast food salad, and is less than 400 calories! Oh, and they have that cool coca cola fountain with a million drink options. Much nicer location than the one on Eastern.

REVIEW #3:  3 stars  (1340 chars)
I had a good experience here. I was in the mood for some of their chili.  I am not ashamed to say that I always enjoy Wendy's chili! Pretty darn good.  Since it was just me, I went through the drive through to take lunch home.  The lady taking my order could have picked up a personality on the way to work today...  but I'm guessing maybe it's just been a long day for her. Otherwise the drive through went pretty smooth and quick. ...  ... I saw they had new flatbread sandwiches.  Guess I might as well try one right?!  I chose the Smokey Honey Mustard Grilled Chicken option... of course with my chili on the side.  On their sign in the drive through, it states the sandwich is only 370 calories and 22 g of protein!  Sure!  I'll give it a whirl!  It was a smaller chicken sandwich but that's probably why only 370 calories.  But it did have a great flavor with the smokey honey mustard sauce.  The flatbread was great also with grains baked in which gave it a great flavor.  Like I stated earlier, I always enjoy their chili.  It's always hot and tasty.  And a small cup of chili is actually pretty filling for me.  You can get onions and cheese added to the top if you want that option.  I'm not one to turn down cheese!  Yummy.   ...  ... A good and quick lunch for me from Wendy's today! Yep, I'd get their flatbread sandwich again.

The cheeseburgers I get here are always room temp so the cheese isn't even melted :/ yet the French are scorching hot and EVERY single time I get chocolate waffle cones in the drive thru they try to just hand them to me as is in no cup, I have to ask every time, As well as constantly being stingy with the ketchup packets, even if I spend 20.00

REVIEW #6:  2 stars  (412 chars)
This Wendy's just opened not too long ago in my area so I was really excited.  Went through the drive thru in which it took 10 minutes to get my food and when I got home the whole order was wrong.  I asked for a hamburger and they gave me a cheeseburger and the fries were not fresh.  Very disappointed.  So much for convenience.  Guess I will have to continue going to the one on Green Valley if I want Wendy's.

REVIEW #7:  1 stars  (281 chars)
Been here twice now. Used drive- thru both times. The service was way too fast. Therefore,I knew that both times our burgers weren't going to be hot and fresh. And I was soooo right. I will not go there again mainly because these prices aren't that cheap for cold dried burgers. :(

I don't know if it was a change in management, a change is support staff or a change in both but this Wendy's location has stepped up their game a bit.  Against my better judgement I went to Wendy's last week to give it another chance after months of a boycott.  I was impressed.  The food came out very quick and my order was accurate.  A spicy chicken sandwich.  I know, it is hard to mess up an order that simple.  So I decided to try again today.  Same situation.  Fast food and an accurate order received.  For that I am giving them a bump up to 3 stars from my previous rating of 2.  Today I ordered a Ceasar side salad, a four piece chicken nugget, and a spicy chicken go-wrap.  My complaint is that one of my four nuggets was about half the size of the other three but that is just the way it was processed.  3 stars seems fair right now for the change in customer service.  Change for the better is progress.  ...  ... I still have a problem with Wendy's on a corporate level.  They have alienated their customer base with cost cutting measures.  They have raised prices and given less food all to make a buck.  The side salad from Wendy's is not a big salad.  It is a side.  Yet the dressing packet was not big enough to even cover the side salad.  I would have asked for extra dressing had I ordered a larger salad.  There are a few items left on the menu I still like so I will probably be back.  Though I will not visit as frequently as I used to.

REVIEW #2:  2 stars  (849 chars)
My aunt once told me that when she orders fast food she tells them to give her whatever they think she wants because she always gets the wrong order anyhow.  Well, I am feeling the same way about Wendy's.  I ask for cheese and onion on the cup of chili.  I get chili with nothing.  I ask for balsamic dressing for my salad and they give me ranch.  I don't get the croutons with my salad.  I order a hamburger.  That is with no cheese.  It comes with cheese.  I try to use a coupon and get told it is not in their system and so I get charged full price.  I have had too many bad experiences with this Wendy's.  When it comes to incorrect orders, slow service, ever increasing prices and smaller portions, I am through with them.  Wendy's may be convenient for my office but it is not worth it.  From now on I will find somewhere else to get my lunch.

REVIEW #3:  2 stars  (235 chars)
This Wendy's is REALLY SLOW at getting food out. The food is pretty standard for Wendy's, but the service is SUPER SLOW. Also, this tends to be the dinner spot for a lot of the homeless from around the area- so carry some loose change.

Horrible drive thru, I was the only customer in the drive thru at 6:27 I pulled up after ordering just a portabello mushroom burger. I paid at 6:28, I know cause I kept looking at the receipt after the black guy who's name said antonio on the receipt said it's going to take less than 5 min. They always tell me to park to the side after any order I get. Finally it's the last time I'm letting them do that because it costed me an 11+ min. wait. I saw 3 other customers behind me park their cars too..and several others in the drive thru leaving with their food. One customer waiting after me left with no food speeding off almost causing an accident. The other behind that one left with the food from an employee bringing them it. I honked my horn and asked why are they being served first and I've been here for 10 min before them!. The tall longer dark hair guy in a hat mumbled off not answering my question and went back inside. Then I walked in. I asked where is my burger and it was like an echo through the place. They came up with it with it after a min. Of what I observed was confusion and they added no comments on their unexceptional service. Two people said "I added an "xtra" med fry for the wait", I don't even like the fries, the are cold and soggy every time, that's why I just wanted a burger by itself. I demanded a refund immediately! I wasn't even hungry anymore I was so upset. I pay for service as much as food. They took their time giving me a refund and asking around like a bunch of Amateurs. They even took my receipt knowing they screwed up in the assessment of this situation. Look up the times and you will see between 6:28pm of paying and at 6:42ish I received my refund meanwhile my car sits out in front of the drive thru. I was late to work and this is the last time I or anyone I work with across the street gets that pitiful service. I'm so upset that a bunch of adults cannot be competent enough to work for what America sees the fast food chain as the lowest form of education. I don't even know why I'm writing this complaint because it will not change anything and you will do nothing for the stress I endured and a recorded tardiness for my work record. But I'm posting this same response in every possible review, therefor causing less money for this company and hopefully making someone aware not to ever go there. You've been warned. Oh and they stop making frosties at 1130pm.

Ordered food today between 5pm and 5:30pm and it was less than ok. The chicken sandwich was good but that is where it ends. Baked potato was cold and this particular store doesn't have cheese or bacon for its potato's? Ok uh huh. The fries were white and raw. The soda had a funny taste and I'm not sure if it was the mixture or the ice.

This place sucks and the service blows.  Waited for 5 minutes with one person in front of me then another 5 mintues - Not fast food at all - Del Taco would probably be better next door or you may make it home in ten minutes to cook yourself something to eat -nuff said

I feel bad that the only review is a one star, and though Ive only been here this one time, and it was at the drive thru, i thought id add that my service was good. The guy at the window spoke english and explained the difference between two burgers well. I got exactly what i ordered, it was a special burger too (plain), and it was fast. So Id give it four stars.

Service:  ... Great. The servers at the drive thru were nice, and our food was ready for us when we got to the window.  ...  ... Price:  ... $10 for two burgers is pretty expensive.. not including drinks or a combo.  ...  ... Food:  ... We got two of the new ciabatta bacon cheeseburgers, and I thought they were really good. I probably won\t buy it again though, just because of the price.

This Wendy's is located between work and where I go after work, haha, and its not that bad, sometimes.......  I have been to this location multiple time, thus the dukedom but unfortunately its more about location and accessability than service (and isn't it true that's the case with most everything these days "/) but I digress, the wait times are longer than average when you dine in or even if you go through the drive thru, and that makes me sad.  The only reason this place is getting two stars is the fact that I know that I will probably be back there, another thing that makes me sad.  There is hope though, every once in a while I get pretty good service so the silver lining is there but hopefully that shines through more often than not!  We will see as I said before I will be back and hopefully they suprise me in a good way!

You don't expect much when you go to Wendy's, despite what their commercials tell you however when I ordered the Caesar Salad I couldn't stop laughing, I wish I was joking but it was lettuce, lemon pepper sauce, and one tomato.  ...  ... That poor bastard. That lonely tomato. He tried his best to hide under the pile of lettuce but it was no use. What kind of salad has one tomato. I would almost prefer no tomatoes by that point. You couldn't throw in some carrot sticks. I don't even need whole carrots, just some shavings would have been fine. ...  ... At least I got a good laugh for my meal at Wendy's.

It literally just took me an half a hour to order two burgers, two fries, two bottled waters and two ice teas. A half a hour! How? Well, I went over to this place and was met by a woman that could barely speak English and could apparently understand even less. I wondered what the hold up was and I see that the problem was car after car having to explain themselves repeatedly to get their point across. ...  ... Yet, this person is handling the drive thru. It is crazy. I mean, I could care less what anyone speaks but if you are running a Wendy's and at the restaurant English speakers are coming in, it would seem to me that you would have someone at the window that speaks English. ...  ... Anyway, the Ice tea was cool and the natural cut fries were great. The burger though, well, I think it needs a bit of help. The bacon just left a bad taste in my mouth. All and all I'd say pass on this Wendys.

we went there the other night and we were going from the drive through, first they got our order wrong, instead of substituting my fries with chillies they added an extra chilli to my order. when i told them they got my order wrong, the manager on the inside rolled his eyes and was bitching to the employee cause he needs to void the transaction now... while i can hear the conversation clearly... while we were waiting for the employee to fix our order the manager ran out side to help the car behind us in order to "help" the service time... but by doing so his ass was right infront of my face because he was talking to the employees through the window... and he did not say sorry or acknowledge us being there by his not so sexy ass... i just left without getting my food... never have i felt so disrespected by a manager that was so unprofessional and rude by sticking his ass by my car window in front of my ass... i wish i could leave a negative star review for this place!

While I don't review a lot of fast food places, I felt the need to talk about this one as it brings forth a point that I make about any and all fast food restaurants. ...  ... But first....  I'm not so much a fan of Wendy's burgers.  Flavor wise, they just don't do it for me.  I am, however, a fan of their chicken nuggets.  And I appreciate the variety on their dollar menu.  My recent discovery, the Cheesy Cheddar Burger is decent.  Not great, but certainly decent, and doable when you need a quick bite. ...  ... The place also gets points for having a nice staff.  I've had good experiences with the staff through every transaction here, and they are helpful and friendly.  I don't ask for a lot, but they do a fine job. ...  ... So what is this "point"?  I don't eat fast food vegetables.  Period.  And I was reminded this when I tried their value menu Chicken Caesar Wrap.  I guess you could point out a "Well, what do you expect for a dollar" comment, but I DON'T expect brown, wilty lettuce.  So I turned my meal into a chicken wrap, minus the caesar.   ...  ... Heh.  I guess you could say that I came to bury caesar, not to praise him.  Come on.  Groan all you want, but I had a great opportunity to add that.  How could I not? ...  ... Well, Wendy's, we'll always have chicken nuggets....

Simple order of Spicy Chicken Nuggets and a small Chili. ...  ... I get a small chili that is so runny that it's like broth and to top that off I was given no crackers. If you don't have enough chili and your giving someone the bottom of the pot then at least give crackers. :(

Bought me a large strawberry lemonade...I should've gotten a medium.  It was really good though.  Ordered large fries.  I thought I'd eat some and save some for later.  Nope, I ate the whole thing at one sitting; the fries were too healthy and not that great.  I asked the cashier for a handful of ketchup.  She told me I couldn't.  Turned out to be a mean joke lol.  And Vegas food prices are ridiculously expensive.

I've been visiting this Wendy's for many years. ...  ... I go around eating at many places in the mall. This is one of my favorite places! I visit them frequently. ...  ...  ... Most of the staff already knows my order. I am treated very well with every visit. ...  ... The quality of food is very equal to any other Wendy's location.  ...  ... I've never had bad service at this location. All the employees are friendly, & efficient.  ...  ... There are some negative aspects to visiting this location. The prices are higher than any location I've ever visited. Another bad thing is 99% of the time they don't have trays, so you get your food in a bag, even if you're dining in. ...  ... It's a great place to get a meal, at a reasonable price, if you're staying in the area.

Oh geesh!  Where to begin. The girl was on her cell phone and all I could think of was "Gurrrrl F*** this job". I ordered a jr bacon cheeseburger to hold me over for dinner and it took 20 min. Insane!!!!  I should've got a frosty cone and called it a day. Not to mention the woman to the side of me kept coughing without covering her mouth. ALL reasons I dislike large crowds, especially at the mall. Bunch of mongaloids work here. I shouldn't be so mean, but Christ on a cracker. At least the woman on her cell phone apologized about the long wait. Now that's GREAT customer service.  ... Less talky and more communication would be even better.

REVIEW #4:  1 stars  (330 chars)
Avoid. These guys have yet to get my order right after 3 visits. Nothing exciting either. Hamburger with catsup. Every time there's something wrong. I'll get a burger with everything, burger with mustard, chicken sandwich...  Definition of Durp. Their receipts print the taunting statement of "Concerns please call" and no number.

This particular Wendys has been getting too much business from me and I dont like it. Im trying really hard to slim down the ole waist line and eating here does not help. ...  ... The salads are delicious.  It's healthy. When theres cheese, grilled chicken pieces, yummy dressing, and other yummy's. ...  ... The chili is awesome ,  I'm crazy about all the beans.I used to make this stuff back in high school. Wendys was after all my very first J.O.B. I used to get the fries and make myself chili cheese fries all of the time ! ...  ... Out of all the fast food places, Wendys apparently has sentimental value to me. My first paycheck and my first slice of financial freedom. ...  ... This location just happens to be the place I worked at. I come here everytime I am in Vegas, I love the food and the people are still nice.

I was here for the first time with my girlfriend back in May. I like Wendy's but there were a few issue. They never had the baked potato and they were not loud enough to call out the food.

REVIEW #4:  3 stars  (893 chars)
After getting an oil change on my lunch break, I needed to find something quick to eat that wasn't going to make me a total fatass. It had been a while since I had been to Wendy's and I remembered hearing they had new salads, so I decided to give them a try. ...  ... The employee that was working the drive thru was one of the fasting talking people I have ever encountered... I had to ask him to repeat himself multiple times. I ended up ordering an apple pecan chicken salad and a baked potato. The salad came with pomegranate vinaigrette salad dressing that was excellent, so tasty for a fast food joint.  The baked potato wasn't the best ever but for a cheap, semi-healthy lunch it did the trick.  ...  ... It is likely I will try this Wendy's again if I need to pick up something quick to eat that won't make me feel like I need to do an extra hour of cardio at the gym later that day...

REVIEW #6:  3 stars  (1857 chars)
I usually don't like reviewing fast-food joints; unfortunately, I have to on this one, due to the fact I constantly visit this Wendy's more than any of the others, especially in the last 3 months.  ...  ... I eat here on occasion for a quick bite, which it has been either around lunch time or late at night. Now, the food will remain the same since it is a corporate-owned fast-food restaurant; therefore, I have no problem with the food, especially the Baja Salad (with no dressing) - superb! Service, on the other hand, can  vary depending on the time you visit this particular location.  ...  ... When I get off the "normal" Vegas shift, roughly 11/1130 pm, and in the mood for Wendy's, the service is standard - no waiting time, no rude service, etc. The late/graveyard shift-workers are exceptional at their job. Around midnight, my friend and I ordered one medium lemonade drink and a small soda drink. Instead, the guy who took our order ended up accommodating us to two medium-sized drinks and charged us for one medium and one small. (I think he was hitting on my friend, but who knows?)  ...  ... Now, there were days after my morning exercise (near brunch hour), I have gone to Wendy's (this particular location) and have gotten the opposite service! The staff during this shift tend to talk more and gossip among themselves in front of the customers, which I have witnessed seeing orders mistaken due to miscommunication on their end, which included mine. I don't know how many times I hear disgruntled employee murmur under their breath as their walking by. I understand it's a minimum wage job, but in front of the customers? Really? I don't know how many times I hear the same employees gossip about one another in front of me as I'm ordering and confuse my order! ...  ... All I'm saying is be observant when visiting this specific location

I would never usually review a fast food restaurant unless I've had a pretty unique, review-worthy experience. And I do have one. ...  ... Wendy's was our last resort before driving back to LA. In-n-Out's line was way too long.  But boy our problems did not end there. This was so long ago that I can't remember all our troubles with this establishment, but I do remember one. My friend ordered a Wendy's chicken sandwich and he got it, WITHOUT THE CHICKEN. If you know, a chicken sandwich is just bread, lettuce, and chicken. Yup. He was missing the whole chicken patty. ...  ... I've never laughed so hard in my life.

REVIEW #8:  2 stars  (280 chars)
I'm eating what could be a baked potato, but it may be a slab of leather...I'm not quite sure.   ...  ... My BLT salad was supposed to be grilled chicken with a balsamic vinaigrette, but it's Italian dressing with fried chicken...hmm ...  ... at least the girl upfront was nice...

REVIEW #9:  2 stars  (226 chars)
Must be the slowest fast food workers I have ever seen. To stand at the counter for 3-5 mins before even being greeted when there's 4 people in the kitchen and only me inside and one car in the drive thru is pretty bad service

REVIEW #10:  2 stars  (556 chars)
Way to fail, Wendy's!  ...  ... I saw a commercial for baked sweet potatoes last night and decided to swing by Wendy's for lunch today to get one. I was also picking up another one for my coworker, two chicken ceaser wraps, and a salad.  ...  ... I went at 11:30, just before the 'standard' lunch time. Wendy's only had one sweet potato available. The lady taking my order thought I said I wanted chicken ceaser sandwiches. I corrected her, but I still ended up with the sandwiches instead of the wraps in my bag. Glad I checked the bag before driving off!

Haven't had Wendy's in a long time, I had been given a gift card, so I thought I'd try out the "improved burgers". ...  ... I had the bacon cheese burger combo, now you can choose from many options instead of fries you can add a salad, or baked potato.  I had the fries.   ...  ... The burger is really very good, it was made fresh, they toasted the bun, it had a couple of thick apple smoked bacon strips, pickles, lettus and tomato.  I enjoyed it very much, it reminded me of the home style my mom made us as kids!

REVIEW #2:  2 stars  (287 chars)
I eat here at least once a month against my better judgement but I'm always hoping for a finger in my chili. I never try any of their new sandwiches or anything I stick to the chili. It's by no means good but hell it's less than $2 and it helps everything come out easier in the morning.

If there was an option for ZERO this would've been it. My boyfriend and I went in for the Portobello mushroom burger during lunch...he orders it and was told they run out of the bread. We ask if there was anything for our inconvenience....the MANAGER comes out and says no. He says they ran out and can't discount the meal. He didn't even apologize for not having the bread. Fine we said. I ordered the 10 pieces nugget instead.  The food came out cold and the nuggets taste like it's been sitting out since this morning.  Bad service!..,check!  Cold food!...check!  Not coming to this location again.

Rude and nasty service at the drive-thru! Whoever was taking the order was very curt and not in the least bit friendly bordering on contempt. I ordered nuggets and fries and everything was stone cold. When I asked to have new food that wasn't cold I was given a terrible attitude from the employee. ...  ... I will NEVER return to this location.

This Wendy's is close to my house.  It used to have great service and no issues, unfortunately the last few times I have gone the drive thru lady has been rude and my order is ALWAYS wrong.  Today was no exception! Ordered 2 combos today, baconator with diet coke and spicy chicken with no mayonnaise. I even politely had the them read the order back to make sure it was correct.  I was given a double cheeseburger with regular coke and the spicy chicken had mayonnaise, that coupled with the rude service was my last straw, I will no longer be going here. :-(

So I stopped here after my less then stellar visit to church's chicken. I was in and out of the drive thru in literally two minutes. I know some people will say well that means nothing is fresh. Well it was hot and it was fast and it was Wendy's. I'm not looking for gourmet. I ordered 2   5 piece spicy nuggets and a new caesar wrap they have. My total was 3 bucks. The nuggets are spicy and the wrap was basically one of their chicken sandwiches cut in half and wrapped up with some lettuce and dressing. Not bad I suppose, and for 99 cents its better then any other places wrap I think. In fact, Wendy's has a HUGE value menu so if your into quick cheap eats, I'd definitely recommend it because I'm sure you can find something.

This Wendy doesn't stick out any more than other location, nor does it suck more than any other location.  ...  ... It's just in the middle. ...  ... More often than not, they are very good with the their customer service. Only once was I served cold fries and had I not been through the drive thru, I would have went back and asked them to replace them.  ...  ... It's good fast food, at decent prices.

I realize I am reviewing a fast-food eatery, but please hear me out because I wanted the world to know what I experienced at this particular location. This is kind of a public service announcement. ...  ... Originally I wanted to go through the drive-thru, but my husband insisted we eat inside. Once inside I was overtaken by the smell of dog food. I'm not even kidding. Straight up folks. I couldn't think of what else the smell would be. I couldn't bring myself to eat here. I told my husband we were leaving immediately. ...  ... I am not sure what makes that smell, but it does not belong in ANY place that is serving *human* food.

They completed redesigned the interior of this Wendy's and because of the new design I am a big fan of coming here.  Justa  few months ago this Wendy's was pretty plain (like most of them), now they have a better looking interior, they have a soda fountain machine with 1000 different flavors, and they have Televisions so like today I can watch Baseball or whatever else may be on.  I really like the fact that they now have a public soda machine so I don't have to go to the counter and ask for a refill which I always thought was the dumbest thing about Wendy's.  Wendy's has improved their food as well.  I really like the Baconator and the son of Baconator.  The new Pretzel bun burgers are pretty good too.  I ordered the Son of Baconator today and with small frries and a drink cost around $7.  Based off the size of the burger and the taste I think it was well worth the price.  Of course they still have the same old yummy frosty and several other inexpensive food chaices as well.  I get tired of eating all the same old burger places all the time, but Wendy's is a good choice when you are on a quick lunch run.  A couple of months ago I would have rated this 3 stars, but due to the very nice interior redesign, it's now a 4.

I come to this Wendy's all the time for lunch. Its super close to work. ...  ... I frequent the drive thru, so this review is for drive thru service only.   ...  ... The staff are friendly and fast, and I have never had an order come back wrong.  No tomato, extra mayo, extra pickle, etc...they've never gotten it wrong for me. ...  ... Yesterday I tried out the grilled chicken flatbread, with the asiago and ranch.  It was really good.  Fresh greens, tomato, and it wasn't drowned in ranch dressing...just enough for some good flavor.

REVIEW #4:  3 stars  (621 chars)
This Wendy's has been recently remodeled and looks great!   ...  ... I always rock the value menu!  I can get nuggets, fries, chicken sandwich and a frosty for under $5!  Dipping the fries in the frosty is nothing new, but dip those nuggets in the frosty and it will change your life! ...  ... I have been coming to this particular Wendy's since 2006 because it's close to my office.  The drive thru is consistently fast and accurate.  While the food quality isn't the best I've had from Wendy's it isn't bad at all.  It might be one of the better Wendy's restaurants in LV but the ones in the mid west are always better.

REVIEW #5:  3 stars  (953 chars)
When I was working in an office in this area, this was one of my most frequent dining experiences. ...  ... Wendy's scores major points because their drive-thru lines are the fastest in the business. More often than not, you are served promptly and correctly. ...  ... Even at this restaurant, that is usually true. However, at this restaurant, they seem to have a difficult time telling the difference between milk, Frostys, and Frosty Shakes. Numerous occasions I ordered a Frosty Shake, only to have them try to give me a regular Frosty at the pick-up window - and on at least one occasion they were standoffish when I explained this to them. Other times, I have ordered a chocolate milk, and they respond with something like "what kind of Frosty did you want?" I NEVER once used the word Frosty. ...  ... Despite my rant, the good does outweigh the bad at this particular location. Just make damn sure they get your order right before you drive off.

REVIEW #6:  2 stars  (489 chars)
Stopped by here to pick up a quick bite on my way home.  Decided to try the new chicken sandwich they've been advertising, sans tomatoes (eww). ...  ... Chicken was dryyy.  And my light lemonade tastes a bit too light - as in it was watered down.  The fries were OK.  It sort of tasted like I got the leftovers from the lunch rush since my visit was a little after 4.  Blah. ...  ... At least they were nice.  This experience does remind me why I don't frequent Wendy's, though.  Oh, well.

I have no idea why this Wendy's is so bad!  We used to go to this Wendy's every once and while, because it's the closest one to the house.  After a while we just kept kept getting terrible food.  I understand that it's fast food and not fine dining.  You come to expect a certain quality of food in the fast food industry and when a fast food joint can't meet that benchmark, well then you have a problem.  Ultimately we just stopped going to this Wendy's.  Then they started their new menu with new meat and ect.  I hadn't had Wendy's for a while so, I actually went to the one close to my work in Henderson.  The one over on Green Valley Ranch.  I came home that day and told my wife that Wendy's tastes a lot better now!  So, she wanted to see for herself.  We went to this Wendy's and it was so bad! I just don't understand why it's so terrible.  They can't seem to get orders right and when they do it's terrible.  I got a spicy chicken and they put a ton of mayo and it was just bad!  Don't waste your time! If you want Wendy's then go to the one on Green Valley Ranch up the road. I wish they had negative starts for this particular Wendy's.

Don't usually review fast food joints, unless I find something interesting to write about. ...  ... Anyway, Wendy's is not a fast food of choice for me, and until my most recent visit yesterday, I probably have not been to a Wendy's in at least 20 years. ...  ... But I was coming back from an appointment, and wanted to grab something fast to snack on before heading over to the Splendor in the Glass Pre Party event at Whole Foods, so I stopped by this Wendy's. ...  ... I ordered a few items off of their value menu, and was pleasantly surprised at how good it was as far as dollar menu items go. ...  ... The Double Stack (I wasn't sure if that was pancakes or burger, and had to asked the cashier) was good and, well, cheap! ...  ... Spicy Chicken Sandwich - spicy, not too dried, pretty good. ...  ... 5 pieces Chicken Nuggets - tiny morsels of flavor, that I can totally snack on while I read. ...  ... Being so closed to where I live now, this might just be a nearby fast food place that I will hit up when I need a quick snack in the middle of the night. ...  ... Cleanliness - 3/5  Not dirty or super clean. ... Location - Lakes area 5/5 for me. ... Food - 3.5/5 For fast food, it is decent. ... Parking - 3/5  Small lot, but plenty of parking nearby if it gets crowded, especially at night after the bank closes.

I love Wendy's, & never really had a problem before, until the other night. I decided to stop in & try their new Buttermilk chicken sandwich, because their commercial on it looked so good. Wow, was I so wrong!!!!!!!!! 1st of all, I paid $4.49 for just the sandwich...it was so small, I thought they gave me the chicken sand off the dollar menu! Also, their was nothing buttermilk about it..it was so spicy, I could hardly eat it, ontop of it being very dry, as they did'nt put any type of sauce on it..I put mayo on it when I got home! Very disappointing, because the commercial made me have high expectations..instead it was like getting $1 spicy chicken sand & paid $4.50 for it!!!!!!!!!!!! :(

This is literally the WORST fast food restaurant I've ever been to and it has nothing to do with the food.  I like Wendy's food, prices, etc.  But the people that work at this location haven't a single clue what they're doing.  I don't know why I continue to go here except that its a half block away from my house and sometimes I want something like Wendy's instead of the other fast food stuff.  But after this (my 3rd time) I can't do it anymore.  I went in and there was 1 person in front of me and it literally took them 10 minutes to get to the lady in front of me because they were still trying to figure out what to do with the last order.  Every time I've been in there it has taken me at least 15 just to get my order taken and its never been busy.  The people are absolutely clueless!   ... If you want Wendy's I suggest finding another location because the people that work at this location are so mind-numbingly unintelligent that it kills the whole taste of the food.

I feel kinda like a dweeb writing a Yelp review for Wendy's but I just have to give props where props are due.  This Wendy's just recently went through a major renovation, and it definitely shows!! Not only is the inside GORGEOUS, but the food is fresher, the customer service better, faster, and friendlier, but coming to Wendy's feels almost like going to a regular restaurant.  Well, maybe not quite, but at least on par with a Panara Bread.  ...  ... When I walked inside, I was a little overwhelmed because everything looked so different. Comfy chairs, lounge areas, flat screen tvs, even a faux fireplace greeted me.  My eyes actually had to adjust because this was not what I was expecting in a Wendy's.  Everything was spotless, with not a random cup or piece of trash in sight. Once I finally figured out where to go to place my order, the cashier was so nice and conversational that it actually took me aback.  My order was ready and complete before I even finished preparing my drink (they have one of those new fangled soda dispensers with 100+ varieties of beverages), and it was hot, fresh, and tasty. ...  ... My drive-thru experience was similarly pleasant.  They only have one window now, but they must have more people working the drive-thru, because I had absolutely no wait time- as soon as I handed over my money, there was someone there handing me my food. ...  ... Hopefully, this is not just a fluke because of the new look and will be consistent. For the meantime, I'm sold!

We were coming from Red Rock to pick up our pumpkin pies.  We were starving and my boyfriend mentioned he wanted Wendy's. We wanted to check it out since it was renovated and decided since we're right here,  why not?  ...  ... Briona our cashier greeted us with a big smile.  I ordered the Portabella melt protein style (no bun, add lettuce). The boyfriend had a 1/2 lb double meal.  ...  ... The soda machine was out of everything besides Dasini, Barq's Root Beer, and Minute made. Yuck. We let someone know while we waited for the food to come up.  Someone offered to go to the fountain in the back & we asked for Coca-Cola.  Then the guy serving up the food was nice,  I let him know the order was missing the lettuce & he fixed it really quick.  ...  ... The food was hot,  fresh and most importantly served in a reasonable amount of time. 3-4 minutes. The restaurant was very clean. We loved the make over & the employees were all super friendly.  Which is great I hate it when you go somewhere & there's that one sour person working that brings the whole staff friendliness down.  Great team work. We'll be back.

Give me my baked potato!!! ...  ... Yep, I come for the baked potato and I'm not ashamed. Let me be honest, I cannot cook baked potatoes. They come out hard, undercooked and nasty. The baked potatoes at Wendy's are heaven. Smothered with cheddar cheese, sour cream, butter, and chives. Deliciousness! They are huge too so no skimpy ones. Just how I like them.  ...  ... Next, their home style chicken sandwiches are cooked to perfection. Never over done, perfect crispy ness, and never greasy. The chicken breast is large and hits the spot.  ...  ... The french fries are hit and miss. Sometimes soggy or over done. you never know what your getting.  ...  ... Now, let's get to the sweet stuff. The frosty is an original hit here. Back when I was little I would dunk my fries but now it just tasted weird. It's sweet but not exactly like ice cream.. More like frozen yogurt. I say get a small and try it. Usually what I do is at the beginning of the year buy a one dollar key chain and get a mini frosty with every purchase that year. Sweet treat at every visit. Even if you go once every 3 months it's only 25 cent a frost. It pays for itself.  ...  ... The coupons to your email and mail are awesome. I always get BOGO sandwich or salad coupons. Saves you a little bit.

I don't usually rate fast food but I visited this Wendy's today and was pleasantly surprised . The service was excellent. The manager walked around asking people how their meals were. He even brought out more sauce for the couple next to us. ...  ... The only thing I noticed was the floor area around the Coke machine (the one that you can get a hundred different combination of soft drinks) was wet & dirty from spills. I guess that comes from getting so many options.  ...  ... I will defiantly be back.

Wheres the beef!? ...  ... Wendys has always been a place to go when we dont wanna make dinner. It has def changed some items, like their fries, which I am now not a fan of! I liked the old fries, they were sometimes mushy but sooooo good! The prices are also always fluctuating, it used to be a JBC was .99 then 1.19, 1.29, and now its 1.69 I think. You can basically get a cheeseburger deluxe for like .99 but its that dang bacon that gets ya! What we usually always get are the small frosties and a small fry to dip them in it : ) YUMM!! ...  ... I like this Wendys bc theyre quick, and have great customer service! Ive never had any bad experiences... YET! LOL.  ...  ... Go here for your chocolate frosty with fries fix!

REVIEW #9:  3 stars  (1365 chars)
I couldn't come here for a while because they were going through a remodel and I have issues with places that stay open during certain construction. There was scaffolding all around the building I just had visions of drywall dust in my food so I had to pass until about a month after the remodel to make sure the dust had settled. I might eat garbage but it has to be dust free good garbage.  ...  ... My wife has been wanting to try the new pretzel pub chicken sandwich so we headed over with coupons in had. I had a BOGO coupon for any of the chicken sandwiches so we ordered 2 of those so we both could try one and then my hungry ass ordered a daves hot n juicy, cheesy cheddar burger, jr cheeseburger deluxe (for the dog) and some chili cheese fries. The pretzel chicken pub sandwich was very good and the thick slice of muenster cheese really stood out... but the pretzel bun didn't. The pretzel bun was very soft but lacked any pretzel flavor. If you are going to put "pretzel" in the name of a product it really should taste like it! The daves hot n juicy is my favorite here these days. I just get the single 1/4 lb and with the fresh veggies on it and it really hits the spot. The burgers here are fresh and never frozen. They also fresh cook bacon. My chili cheese fries were a good 3.5 stars. ...  ... I saw they have frostys in a waffle cone now. Nifty.

REVIEW #10:  3 stars  (539 chars)
This Wendy's was totally remodeled. The dining room was maid to look like a cafe. It's the nicest looking Wendy's I've ever seen. ...  ... Prices are good. Service was great. It's comparable with other Wendy's in the area! ...  ... Figuring out where to order and pick up your order, is a bit confusing.  ...  ... They have the new cola machine, which gives you anything you want. ...  ... The seating is very comfortable, and it's the only Wendy's I've ever seen with a fireplace. ...  ... I would return to this Wendy's restaurant again.

REVIEW #11:  1 stars  (365 chars)
I thought this location was nice, but unfortunately not the cleanest when it comes to food prep. I found a moth in my salad.  Their social media rep responded immediately, but the local management didn't respond until my SECOND email to corporate.  If you eat a salad from this location, make sure you inspect it thoroughly for extra protein not listed on the menu.

What can i say. Its Wendys. But when i pull up to the Drive thru and the Guy on the other end says Welcome to Wendys We are better than Mc Donalds thats always a good thing. And I love the new Menu option with half a Salad and then you pick out of other things. I had a frosty. The BLT Cobb salad was delicious with no dressing on it. And they kept the drive thru moving.

I am a longterm customer of this Wendy's location. The employees are friendly and the food is fairly constant. They take care of their regulars. ...  ... For the most part the dining room is clean.

I'd never thought I'd find myself rating a Wendy's, but the employees here aren't your typical glazed over, fast food workers. They're.....friendly. So much so, that when I need my fast food fix in the area, I will almost always choose this Wendy's. ...  ... The recent changes to the menu are fine by me, but the employees here make drive thru stops quick and painless. What can I say? This Wendy's is a winner!

REVIEW #5:  4 stars  (833 chars)
Though Wendy's isn't my go-to fast food spot, I always enjoy ordering from there.  ...  ... I almost never change my order there, haha. I always get a Jr. Bacon Cheeseburger, value cut fries, 4 piece crispy chicken nuggets (with BBQ sauce), and a chocolate frosty. This meal is so cheap, it's crazy, but it really hits the spot. I personally like their chicken nuggets better than McDonald's. ...  ... Recently I started ordering the strawberry lemonade, which is quite tasty! ...  ... I noticed they now offer a caramel frosty? I haven't tried it yet, but it sounds delish! I may have to try it next time I visit. ...  ... Oh, I also noticed that this location is open very late now! I can't remember the exact times, but I believe they are open until at least 1 am everyday. I think the latest they stay open is until 2 am! Yaaaay!

REVIEW #1:  5 stars  (1060 chars)
This review is for the Wendy's inside MCCarran Airport in Las Vegas. For some strange reason, this Wendy's location was freaking amazing when we were there. I'm pretty certain it's the best Wendy's I've ever had. I had a Pretzel Bacon Burger, and my wife had some sort of breakfast flatbread sandwich. Everything tasted remarkably fresh, and the bacon was perfectly crispy. This was a very surprising experience.   Honestly, the food quality was more like a sit-down restaurant than a fast food joint. ...  ... Generally, I do like Wendy's well enough. But this was far beyond other experiences I've had with the chain, so much so that I felt compelled to give them an Internet thumbs-up. I don't know if this location is always this good, but wow...unexpectedly exceptional, especially for an airport restaurant. ...  ... I did notice there are a few reviews on this airport Wendy's from 2011 that are fairly poor.  I wonder if management is different there now?  I'm not sure what's changed, but the place was pure greatness when we were there (August 2013).

REVIEW #2:  3 stars  (914 chars)
Congratulations, Wendy's, your track record is 100% - every time I order NO tomatoes, you put EXTRA. Must be something in your training, as it's universal.  ... Page 236 of the employee handbook, "When a customer orders no tomatoes, you can assume they are delusional. They surely meant double tomatoes. Give them extra and they will see the error of their ways. After all, we know what's best for them. They will thank you for it, like Obamacare or the TSA." ...  ... They get three stars because the food quality was actually quite good (once I got my revised version). They were also very quick.  ...  ... They would have gotten 4 stars if the lady behind the counter hadn't rolled her eyes, as if to say, "This PITA actually wants her order correct? As if!" ...  ... Also, since they screwed up, they should have offered a free drink, French fry, or at least an extra napkin. Even a sorry would have been nice.

REVIEW #5:  2 stars  (384 chars)
Not really much to say other than the convenience of a Wendy's in the airport which is nice if you are in the mood for a burger and a Frosty. The only problem was airport prices! The cheapest combo if I remember correctly was $8. I got a chicken sandwich combo and a small frosty and my bill was $13. Really sad! I just don't understand the need to gouge the consumer for convenience.

Just what you would expect from an airport fast food establishment. Mediocre/bad service, horrendously expensive prices ($3.00 for a burrito smaller than a small cell phone, or $2.62 for a small soda?) The food was alright, maybe it tasted better, I tried to savor each of the three bites that burrito took to consume, realizing each bite was $1.00.

First of all, I am new in this area visiting my aunt from the hospital. We went to get a drink at this Wendy's and the first door was closed. So we thought lol and then we saw a different door and we found out that door was just stuck. And the girls working there were like laughing about it.  ... And I guess they were like you need more muscles or whatever. Rudee!!  ... They were like being all clumsy knocking stuff over and laughing. This girl came out from the door from the register and locked the girl out I guess and the girl locked out threw some cup lids at her. Totally unprofessional. I wont be coming back here again.

Dont waste your time. The girl behind the counter was incredibly rude for no apparent reason, because you work at a  fast food joint and didn't amount to anything don't take it out on me. ...  ... First I asked if they had a military discount cause every other wendys does and she said no with an attitude. Second i ordered two meals and she kept getting it wrong. It took her 3 tries. Then when she made the drinks she slammed them on the counter almost spilling them. You would think that her seeing me by myself with two orders she might offer a drink carrier but no, so i ask for one and she just tosses it on the counter. Once i get my food i asked for ketchup she gave me 1 packet so i asked for some more packets she walks away and comes back with 1 more packet. Worst lunch ever

REVIEW #4:  1 stars  (836 chars)
FOOD POISON!! Yep! I'm living it right now, and have been for the last few days. I ordered a burger, fries, and a strawberry lemonade and about 2 hours later I started my 3 day journey to and from the bathroom. I called them the morning after it begun and asked for a manager(I believe Fernando) who, after telling him what happened, said "Yeah, I mean, stuff happens."  WOW. I then told him he should go over cooking and food safety with his employees which apparently he thought was funny and unnecessary by his chuckle and lack of interest in my suggestion. Anyway he did offer to comp me food as if I wanted to ever return, and when I said I didn't want to eat there again he suggested a salad. Whenever I become well again I will probably be calling again and hopefully getting a number to someone that takes food safety seriously.

REVIEW #5:  1 stars  (555 chars)
I usually post some place that's worth going, but this is a place I have to fore-warn you about. ...  ... First, bad customer service.  Wrong me the order, then made me wait 15 minutes for a hamburger since everything is frozen solid.  No apology from the manager, and didn't even notify me the ETA of my burger. ...  ... 2nd, their "FRESH" salad is rock solid.  If you want "FRESH" frozen salad, this is the place to be.   ...  ... 3rd, I would not go to any Wendy's anymore unless Dave comes out personally and apologize to customers they've pissed off!

REVIEW #6:  1 stars  (386 chars)
One of the worst Wendy's locations in Las Vegas.  I can not remember them ever getting my order right from leaving out things to forgetting straws and napkins.  I get the impression they just don't care at all.  Bad customer service.  Dirty bathrooms.  The place is ghetto.  Do not go there.  I wish it was better, but it's just not.  You are much better off going to Arbys or anywhere.

I would like to give them four stars but unless you pay careful attention to your order there is a very good chance they will screw it up.  I don't get a good vibe from the staff either, I have yet to have real bad service but I get the impression they don't really care.  That's fast food..... ...  ... I only go back for a few reasons.

This Wendy's is pretty good as far as fast food places go.   We have never had a bad meal here and their menu is becoming more and more health conscious.   They now have the natural cut fries.  They include Marzetti salad dressing with their salads.  Marzetti uses really healthy ingredients.  They also have baked potatoes that most fast foods don't offer.  Their chili is pretty good too.

I love Wendy's but will next time go to one of the other locations within the city when I get a craving for a frosty.  The staff is a little harsh, my order was not right and the fries were cold.

Huge disappointment and I know it's the hired help, went to the 2858 Fish hatchery Rd. location here in Madison, WI during what must be the second shift at 17:16:49. I used to go there all the time for lunch and the Spicy Chicken sandwich rocked as well and the fries were perfect. Well this time I tried the Spicy Chicken Guacamole Club Combo...it was just downright nasty. At least the Chicken nuggets were ok, said my son. So on with my taste test...now mind you I love Wendy's I even own Stock in the Company which is more so why I feel like I was let down. The Chicken had resembled something that was under a 50 lb anvil, squished flat and over cooked, the fries were cold and soggy by the time we got got home. A 2.5 min drive home. Oh and my daughter that gave the order and payed the 16.64 bill was a bit upset and said wow are they rude. there you have it same place different shift...go figure.

Really ZERO STARS!!! ... I don't know why but they can't get my order right. The order taker gets it right because when I check my receipt, it is correct. The food in the bag is ALWAYS WRONG.

It's fast food, how hard is it to get right?

I am 95% sure I acquired a nasty food based illness here. I ate some of the chicken nuggets, and within 2 hours I was terribly ill, vomiting the entire contents of my stomach into my kitchen sink because I was not able to get to the bathroom.  ...  ... It was that bad.  ...  ... As for the service, the 'help' if you can call it that clearly did not want to be working at the place, and I observed several questionable hygiene related issues in regards to how the staff handled themselves - and the food.  ...  ... How was I able to do this, you ask? Well good reader, the reason is that I was standing for 10 minutes at the counter waiting for my order, a Hamburger, a single order of chicken nuggets, a baked potato, and a large soft drink. I had ample time to observe these things.  ...  ... I know only the most 'interesting' person would actually enjoy working at a fast food place, but the help here set a new bar of horribleness - if the bar was buried 3 feet into the ground that is.  ...  ... Add in the for lack of a better term - 'wiped out' dining room which was filthy, and you get fast food hell. Avoid at all costs - go to another Wendy's - any other Wendy's.

Not sure what happened to the beef at Wendy's, BUT I have been to this location and the fish hatchery location and the newer thicker beef patties have a strange old meat flavor.

Wow, I found a Starbucks that hasn't been reviewed yet, and I bet that loads of Yelp-er peeps have been here.  Coffee at Starbucks is Coffee at Starbucks; the flavor doesn't change much... ...  ...

I would not recommend going here if you plan on staying a while to study. Finding an empty table is very hit and miss and there's just a lot of traffic. It can get distracting. ...  ...

I love Starbucks and have high expectations for my experience.  The register partner was great, I give him a 5.  He was friendly and nice even though a bunch of people just walked in.  The Redhead that seemed to be in charge was a little tense.  She told the barista 5 times that the Java Chip Frappuccino gets drizzle.  She seemed a little irritated with her for forgetting.  The barista asked if the customer wanted the drizzle and they were adamant that they did.  She put the drizzle on the drink.  The redhead continued to tell her that the drinks with chips get drizzle.  I tried to be nice to the redhead and asked about her store.  She was irritated and bitchy.  I know it is frustrating to train people  when your store is a little busy but you are in the people business serving coffee.  Try to remember that, mean redhead lady.  Starbucks may need to remind her of the core purpose, "To create an uplifting experience that enriches people's daily lives".  Enter at your own risk!

I stopped here at 2:15 for an iced coffee.  There are only 3 people in store and I can't see how many card are in the drive-thru but they seem to only be concerned about their customers in the cars because it took 5 minutes to pour a simple black iced grande coffee!

REVIEW #5:  2 stars  (493 chars)
Terrible service. First, they charged me for a venti when I ordered a grande. Then, I had to wait for more than 15 minutes for my drink because they made a few drinks in a row wrong. At one point there were more drinks waiting on the counter than people in the store, and yet somehow none of them were mine.  ...  ... At least they made me the larger size that I didn't order.  ...  ... Tip: go to the other Starbucks down the street. I'm convinced the workers at the one don't listen or care.

REVIEW #5:  4 stars  (1040 chars)
This is my local Starbucks.  It's a bit on the small side but that's ok, it feels homey.  All the locals are here getting their morning cup....guys starting their days and having a chat, women either on their way to drop the kids off or just dropped them off and are on the way to work in need of a java jolt.  The folks behind the counter are friendly and they remember people and their orders.  I've only been in twice but I'm sure the more I frequent, they will remember my order.  This time of year I change it up a lot though......I just can't make up my mind.  Do I get a Gingerbread Latte, a Peppermint Mocha or a they have started something called a Caramel Brulee.  They are all yummy and just what is needed to wake up in the morning!   The only reason it's not 5 stars is because I think they have gotten a little pricey over the years.  One of the first things I cut out on a budget is coffee.  At over $4 for a Grande anything, it's now a treat from time to time instead of a daily thing.  It's still a darn good coffee though.

REVIEW #6:  4 stars  (987 chars)
This location is super convenient and the parking and strip-mall is always easy to get in and get out.. and if you feel like sitting down, there's sufficient (a bit cozy) room inside or if the weather is nice, there are plenty of tables/chairs outside.   ...  ... The staff is quick and friendly and since my drink is simple, they've rarely "screwed" it up (unless you count too much foam on a macchiato).  The longest line I've ever had to endure was a whole line of 3 people in front of me (yes, even at peak coffee hour).. so really, no complaints there. ...  ... You'll notice a lot of local people do their coffee here as there really is no local coffee joint nearby to give this place any competition (yeah, that's hard to do when it's a SB, but I'd give a local coffee joint my business)... a lot of morning cyclists, or morning ppl enjoying their coffee with a paper. ...  ... This is a good Starbucks.. the same faces and consistently well made drinks.. no hassle.. feels local.

I would generally give all Starbucks 5 stars....yes sometimes your drink taste like poop, but most of the times they nail it.....well except if you go to one in a grocery store.  ...  ... This one is great...minus the lady with the black curly hair. Fire her already. Why is she so rude %99 of the time? I avoid this one solely because of her.

REVIEW #9:  3 stars  (335 chars)
Small sized Starbucks shop.  Service is fast even when really busy and servers are polite.  We like to go walk over from our house on weekends and enjoy a coffee.   ...  ... Three stars because the tables were all dirty in the shop and on the patio the chairs were covered in bird poop and obviously hadn't been cleaned in a long time.

When you give a tip at this location, the employees are always genuinely grateful for it. (More than I can say for the Starbucks by my house, who gets tipped when they don't even get my drink right and don't seem grateful at all.)  ...  ... I just love this location. Everyone is friendly, service is fast, my order is always correct. I've never had a bad experience. Keep up the good work, John and crew!

Nice drinks, but...Wow, long wait at drive-thru.

REVIEW #6:  3 stars  (594 chars)
If I can give them 2.5 stars I would. Its sad how this is the ONLY Starbucks off the freeway over here and the drive-thru is backed up in ways you couldn't imagine. I frequent SB everyday (DEFINITELY not this one) and this is, by far, the slowest establishment I have EVER been to. Its ridiculous, mind you it's 12 pm on a Sat. I only stop here when times are desperate, this is one of those times. There should be a time limit on the drive-thru..seriously. I had a 10 FaceTime convo with my bestie while waiting to get up to place an order, I still haven't gotten my drink.  ...  ... Holy cow!

REVIEW #7:  3 stars  (795 chars)
This is one of the closest Starbucks to my house, so if I'm sitting at home and have a sudden craving for an iced tea, hot chocolate, or apple cider, this will be my first choice.  Drive-through can get clogged up pretty quick in the morning, but avoiding peak hours helps keep it smooth.  They do tend to run out of their baked goods rather quickly, though I don't normally indulge in them, so not really an issue for me.  I will note that about 1/6 times I visit this location, they get my order wrong (I ask for soy milk in hot drinks and no sweetener in tea), which is fine, because getting a free drink 1/6 of the time makes me feel better about frequenting a corporate chain. ...  ... Note:  Parking can get cramped, especially with the drive-through exiting through the middle of the lot.

REVIEW #8:  2 stars  (1529 chars)
I really don't want to rank a 2, but I have just had it. I love this location and especially with the drive through. Peak times are HORRIBLE at this place with the layout of the parking lot and drive through (not their fault through), but other times its okay. I have noticed this location is starting to have a LOT of quick turn over. We came here for so long and got to know everyone but each time I go in while is 4 or more times a month, always different people. always friendly though! I do give a 4 star for customer service.  ...  ... But I am rating 2 stars for the drinks. I went in today (drive through) and got my usual today, a tall Mocha frap with whip. It tasted horrible. It seems like that EVERY TIME I come to this one, they make my drink differently. They never follow the same process or didn't wash out the blender container. I was a good mile or more away this morning running to another errand before I REALLY got into my drink to notice and I was NOT turning back around. I shouldn't have to turn around and walk in just to get a common drink re-made. It is just so frustrating. I have had to go back multiple times to get drinks remade at this location. I am just over it. I respect Starbucks as a company and commend their efforts and service, but I am starting to get the feeling that they are loosing their values because they are such a huge name and staple in our modern day and society. I really hope they get back on track. I am to the point of wanting to find local shops and support them instead.

REVIEW #9:  2 stars  (125 chars)
I was going to give them a "1" star, but they did get half of my order right, and what they gave me by mistake was delicious.

REVIEW #10:  2 stars  (289 chars)
Slow drive thru...order wrong.....speaker at drive through order board terrible.....parking lot configuration sucks. Wife's coffee not made very well. I appreciate the staff trying to make up for all of the short comings of this location. If not for them this would be a one star for sure.

REVIEW #11:  1 stars  (391 chars)
Both times I have been in this location I have asked simple questions and two different employees have rolled their eyes and made me feel like asking a simple question about merchandise would completely put them out. As a fellow Starbucks employee, I would be written up if we ever treated a customer like that. I recommend going to any other Starbucks in the area. This one literally sucks.

Starbucks is Starbucks. Can't say I can review the coffee because it is pretty much the same across the company. If you like coffee at one Starbucks, you'll like it at this one too. Staff was friendly enough and got my coffee (vanilla latte) out quick. I prefer local coffee spots if I can find them, which get my four and five star ratings.

I really enjoy this Starbucks and wish it was closer to my home. Most Starbucks are created equal as far as product goes but this location offers superb customer service.

REVIEW #5:  4 stars  (586 chars)
I don't know what everyone is talking about. If you come in the early morning rush hour, it will be busy and drinks will take longer. People want the baristas to be very quick yet welcome the customer and chit chat-- just can't be that way people. Anytime I have gone in, the staff has been friendly. If I am in the drive through, they try to get me out of there quick and complete my order. You can't blame the staff for indecisive and snobby customers. Only problem I have here is that it's usually a little dark and unwelcoming inside so I feel sleepy when trying to do homework lol.

REVIEW #6:  4 stars  (421 chars)
I'm a starbucks fan! I really like going to a starbucks where the employees are friendly, knowledgable and they remember you and your drink!  The only reason why this location doesn't get 5 stars is because their drive-thru is slow.  I'm not sure if they may be understaffed for the drive-thru, but it takes awhile to move through and get your beverage.  The location is perfect, close to the freeway and in a nice plaza.

REVIEW #7:  4 stars  (1144 chars)
Oh no, not another Starbucks review. But, read on. ...  ... I come here two to four times a week, mostly to relax and have some quiet time. If you come here often, you might find that statement funny, since there's always a steady stream of folks coming and going.  But the line is never longer than three, go figure. ...  ... This is an above average location for Starbucks, in so far that you have the space to linger, sip your beverage, snack and read a paper. The wall spaces have a few 110 outlets, so you know who sits there.  But the beauty here are the spaces that come away from the wall, which are always free.  ...  ... As others have noted, the drive-thru is a mess. So I've never understood why more patrons haven't decided to come inside and see how friendly and inviting this store really is.  All the employees are great btw.  Fortunately most have decided to stay in their cars. Fortunate for me. LOL ...  ... I've found 6:30 to 7:30 am and 2:00 to 4:00 are good times to linger.  If you do, I'll be sitting at the big table near the door. Stop by and say "hi"!  ...  ... So, three and seven-eighths Stars, and yes, I am a fan.

REVIEW #9:  4 stars  (389 chars)
Small, out of the way, but still really convenient when you need a pick-me-up.  I usually stop here on my way home after grocery shopping at Whole Foods, get a shaken iced black tea lemonade - no sweetener, and the rest of my evening is calm and relaxing.  The staff are always really pleasant to talk to and offer cheerful greetings whether it's through the drive-through or in the store.

REVIEW #10:  3 stars  (502 chars)
Location is a bit too small for how busy it is. The seating area probably needs some rearranging to be more efficient. There is some wasted space for retail that could probably be better if it was used for seating. In the winter when the weather is nice, the outdoor seating helps to solve the issue. One other thing I noticed is the WIFI isnt' very reliable. I stop by between meetings to get a drink and use WIFI and often have a hard time staying connected or using it for anything business related.

REVIEW #13:  2 stars  (347 chars)
Seems like this particular Starbucks is always understaffed. The wait is always forever and they often make the drinks wrong! A couple times they handed me someone else's black coffee when I ordered a hazelnut macchiato, and of course its after I left the drive-thru that's when I found out. How inconvenient it is to go back to get the right one.

REVIEW #14:  2 stars  (342 chars)
Starbucks is supposed to be my escape from the office, so splurging for an over priced drink is easily justified. Not this time though, the cashier and manager seemed annoyed by my presence at 10:30am on a Friday morning. I guess they were enjoying not having any customers. Bad attitudes with my over priced coffee is a hard pill tk swallow.

Worst Starbucks I have ever been to!! FLAT OUT HORRIBLE SERVICE!  Took me probably ... 5-7 just to get a Carmel Frap. One person working while the rest were standing around shooting the bull.And on top of it all, I continue to try this place out to see if maybe just one trip here will be quick. NOPE.  ... The drive thru line is even worse. For some reason the customers who go to this particular Starbucks feel like they are special because on top the horrible customer service I have spent countless minutes sitting behind a person who either has the mental capacity of a toddler or who doesn't understand the magical voice contraption to their left...(because they take forever to order)... THEN these geniuses get up the window they forget to order their favorite little side with their coffee... wow... SOME OF US DON'T DRIVE A PRIUS. Thanks for wasting my gas and time.

REVIEW #2:  2 stars  (1259 chars)
This location of Starbucks let me down yesterday. It was 11am. I had met my sister here before we headed out on the town for the day. I was hungry for a breakfast sandwich or hot sandwich from the fridge that they will heat in the over for you. They were out of almost all flavors of sandwiches, they had only 3 left. They were also out of all breakfast sandwiches including the turkey bacon with egg, I understand that it was 11am but still, most Starbucks have these sandwiches well into the afternoon hours.  ...  ... I decided to try the faijita chicken sandwich with pepper jack from the refrigerated section at the counter. The cashier was very rude about the lack of sandwiches in the first place. She got irritated that I asked if they had a ham and swiss sandwich when it wasn't out. Anyhow, she heated up the sandwich and wrapped it up for me. The chicken was disgusting and I pulled a couple of pieces out and they had black spots on them. I am not sure how long that particular sandwich had been sitting out but eww. ...  ... I did also have a passion tea and it was delicious as usual. Rule of thumb, come here only for drinks, avoid the food at this location. I would only come back for coffee or tea. Customer service was also not the greatest.

REVIEW #3:  2 stars  (425 chars)
Wedge shaped inside and very cramped. There's about 15 people crammed around the pickup counter, the condiment stand is not accessible at all. Then when it cleared,  there are other cream carafes.  ... Starbucks deliberately keeps the stores small like this so their sales per square foot metric comes in high. There's one store I've been in that's. It cramped and this is not it. Boise ID on State St. should be their model.

It's a Starbucks! Franchised food chain that offers exceptional coffee and service. Located on the northeast corner in the target shopping area but not the Starbucks inside the target.  ...  ... Every time I've stopped into this location I have received excellent customer service! They have a drive through which is very convenient and a large lounge area which is nice for doing whatever it is you're going to do at Starbucks while soaking up their free Internet. I recently got turned on to the Starbucks card/app for my iPhone so this has been a pleasurable experience. Now I get all these benefits so why not come enjoy them. This franchise really has their stuff together! Five-star reviews all around

I am not a Starbucks fan due to its high price. But this location thrive on its friendly staff, always. I take my daughter there everyday after her swimming lesson. The service was great each time we were there. And of course you can stay there in the well decorated room. Due to its west exposure, I would say sitting there in the afternoon was not that pleasant.

The layout and design of this Starbucks is great.  Lots of space.  Unfortunately, on our visit the team wasn't doing a very good job keeping that space clean.  The trash can is overflowing and the tables need to be wiped down.  They were friendly though and that means a lot in my book so I'm giving them 4 stars for this visit but hope they would focus on the environment a bit more and ensure food items are stocked appropriately.  That'll get them to 5.

This Starbucks recently opened and it has been quite the pleasure. Prior to this opening I was always having to wait in the long lines at the Starbucks at Arizona Ave and 202. Now that is one is open, no more long lines! The best thing about this coffee shop is that the inside is HUGE! There is a lot of room for seating and there is a patio if one wishes to enjoy this beautiful March weather.  ...  ... The staff is quite friendly (in fact, they gave me a free coffee the other day) and are always attentive to your needs. There is a drive-thru if you don't wish to use your legs and I've yet to wait more than 5 minutes to get my beverage :)

REVIEW #7:  2 stars  (1323 chars)
Im not impressed with this new location at all, I guess disappointed would be the right word. Its in a nice area of Chandler with many new buildings going up so I had high hopes entering this store. Its beautiful inside. Spacious with "newer" more modern decor. Although the wait staff is nothing short of unskilled and unprofessional. THREE out of the four times i came the drive through was closed. Whats the point of a drive through if you never use it. I came in at 2pm on a Tuesday. There was one barista ringing in orders and a line of about four people ahead of me. She was one of the slowest cashiers ever, the woman being serviced demanded a gift card for next time due to poor service. When it finally was my turn, I ordered a mocha light frappacino with added whip cream. Thats not being too difficult is it? Apparently to the barista it was. As I waited for my drink the man ahead of me told here she forgot the cream in his coffee and he stood there for about five minutes because she had to "get more half and half" . Ugh. He was visually upset too. Then when my drink was served, it was a coffee frappacino! I told her my order once again and she made me a mocha light frappacino and for got the added whip. Whatever, I give up and leave. Even though this location is convenient...its not worth the headache.

I have a Starbucks closer to my house right on Ray and 101. BUT always go to this location on Ray & McClintock. The staff here is great. I especially love the drive thru lady who works Mon to Fri (she isn't there weekends). Being a Starbucks addict, having the same friendly barista is something I prefer. My drink is always made correctly. Which when I walk in and order from someone I don't know, it seems to be a 50/50 on if it is made correct. Only thing I request extra is chocolate drizzle inside cup. Lots of Starbucks mess that part up. So I use drive thru every time now, knowing my drink will come out correct. Service is quick too. Never long lines.

Ok....generally I would not review a Starbucks....BUT I go to this one fairly often considering it is in the parking lot where I park my car on thurs during my internship....long story, whatever. So it's generally pretty good, but today I was in line behind this van for like a bazillion years (15 min).... I got up to the window and the girl had my drink ready AND gave it to me for free! WooHoo! That was super awesome. So for that reason, this location is cool in my book.

I like this location because they have a drive-thru. Even though there is almost always a long line, they get you on your way fast. The staff is friendly and competent. Also, they rarely run out of anything (other locations seem to go through their entire inventory of breakfast sandwiches and scones by 9am). ...  ... If you are the type that does not drink your morning coffee inside a moving vehicle, they also have comfy chairs inside and decent patio seating.  The patio faces the parking lot and drive-thru but it does have shade umbrellas so it can be very pleasant in the morning.

There are 3 drive thru Starbucks on Ray/Rural, Ray/McClintock, Ray/101N. I come here the most, in-store and drive thru. Honestly, the staffs here seem a bit indifferent or at least they made me feel like they are better than me. However, the drive thru here seem to be the quickest out off all.

So I think its a given that Starbucks has great coffee...so what I would like to say most about this location is the customer service ROCKS!  Everyone is always extremely friendly, the service is super duper fast and they usually have my husbands order ready to go the second they see him walk in the door...yes he goes nearly every day.  That is what I call good customer service.  Service with a smile and employees that remember you, it makes you feel appreciated, even if you are only buying a cup o' joe.!

I am a coffee addict but totally fine with that.  ...  ... This Starbucks location I frequent all the time. Great crew here.  ...  ... One positive and negative is their drive-through. While convenient at times, in the morning especially it get's insanely busy and the wait can be a bit much. The upside though is they often put their money where their wait is, if the wait is too long they often end up buying your coffee that morning. I've had it happen 3 times in on month. So I can't complain. ...  ... Robert Pfeifer

This is not the closest Starbucks to me, but it's the closest one with a drive-through... and sometimes I'm just that lazy!

This is the Starbucks I prefer above all others in my area!  Whenever I walk in, or drive thru, I feel like Norm from the old tv show, Cheers ... everybody knows by name, and greets me using it and a smile. :) More often than not, they know what my drink of choice is, too!  Trisha and Jen are two of the most bubbly, upbeat, customer service-oriented people I have ever encountered.  But honestly, I have yet to encounter anyone there who doesn't seem to love doing what they do, or fake it really well! Quality service with a smile ... not easy to find these days; this Starbucks location offers it in a big way! :)

I don't generally patronize Starbucks.  For one thing, I'm not a coffee drinker.  However, wife and daughter are.  They both love the coffee here (in general).  So we popped in this morning on the way to dropping daughter at a friend's house, and on our way to work.   ...  ... They got, and seemed happy with, their pricey coffees.  They also bought me a pricey "old fashioned" donut.  The donut was really good.  I don't think it was $1.50 good, but it was vastly better than Dunkin or any grocery store donut (which isn't a very high hurdle to clear, I admit).  If they weren't so pricey I'd give them four stars for quality of food and beverages. ...  ... In summary:  very pricey, but pretty good.  If you want to splurge (or are rich enough you don't care about price), come to Starbucks.  This shop had friendly staff who moved quickly.

REVIEW #9:  3 stars  (1321 chars)
This is my friendly neighborhood Starbucks.  I am sad that I am finding myself here more frequently since the two closest independent coffee houses have gone under. ...  ... RIP the independent coffee house but alas I must still have my caffeine fix. ...  ... This location has a rather nice outdoor seating area.  They seem to be heavily staffed on most of my visits.  Given, they are pretty busy but I still find myself watching in amazement as 6-7 people scramble about. ...  ... I am always struck at how it takes 6-7 people to do roughly the same work that someplace like Coffee Rush does with 1 or 2 people. ...  ... Not infrequently my order is either wrong or has to be stated and restated 4-5 times.  I suspect this is a result of too many folks working on the outcome.  Like the game that is played in elementary schools where a statement is made at one side of the class and whispered from child to child until it reaches the other end of the room.  So child #1 whispers "Henry stubbed his toe at the pool." and the last kid is told, "Henry found human toes stuck in the pool filter." ...  ... Lost in translation.   ...  ... Too much noise in the system.   ...  ... That is why about 25% of the time I end up with a nonfat hot chocolate or something rather than a no whip, extra hot mocha.  Such is Starbucks.

Your typical Starbucks. The only negative is about half the time their wifi doesn't work, which can be frustrating. I often go to Starbucks to get a little work done.

Great location, quick drive thru and friendly service.  This store is BIG and has been renovated.  It's a great location to study, read, have a meeting or just enjoy a cup of coffee and relax.  It's on the corner, so the location is convenient to get to.  If you love starbucks stop by this one for sure!

I went through the drive through this morning and had to wait to get inline but only for a second. They were fast, efficient and wasted no time getting all the customers through the line. I needed that this morning and I am extremely please.

This particular store is big but not very quiet if you want to come and read. The service is great and the greeting over the intercom is always a pleasant, especially from male-baristas. They are always trying to move the drive-thru quickly enough, not taking their sweet time like the one on Ray/ 101

REVIEW #6:  4 stars  (1085 chars)
Brand new location right on my way to work!  It is on the SE corner of Rural and Ray in the Fry's shopping center.  Even though I drive thru this intersection frequently, it is not easily seen from northbound Rural since it is behind the Wells Fargo which I guess is why I never noticed it until today even though they have been open for two months.  I believe the building used to be a Pollo Loco which explains the somewhat bland structural design and awkward layout.  It is nice and big inside, though, with enough room for two full size leather couches.  A gaggle of teenagers was making good use of them on the evening we stopped by.  Other than that group the place was pretty empty and so there was plenty of tables open.  I noticed that they also had a big patio with plenty more seating outside.  Another nice thing is that they have a drive thru.  The easiest way to enter is from Ray but it wraps all the way around the building.  Hopefully that means it will be convenient and not too crazy during busy times.  I will write an update when I try it out on a weekday morning.

REVIEW #7:  4 stars  (424 chars)
Can you believe that an Espresso Coffee can not be shared with a Tocino del Cielo? It is an insult to the population of Chandler.  ... I made a line for more than 3 mins. I had an attendant behind the counter that spoke Italian, Spanish and English. The leather seats were comfortable and the benches were spacious.  ... The next time we come here I will bring my own Rajita de Crema to enjoy my Macchiato as it is expected.

REVIEW #8:  4 stars  (445 chars)
I like this location to others. nothing like the taste of the walmart of coffee. I dig the layout. ...  ... lots and lots and lots and lots and lots of first world problems in the reviews for this place. ...  ...  a whole lot of, " my milkshake, my milkshake".  ...  ... Cause if you put that much sugar and caramel and mocha in your coffee you are drinking a milkshake. ...  ... Meanwhile in the third world..... ...  ... Shame, Shame Chandler.

REVIEW #9:  4 stars  (645 chars)
I'll chime in and give this location a ratings boost.  The main thing they have going for them is their drive-thru.  They always seem to move people through really quickly.  The other location down on Chandler Ave always has a much longer line.  They have a nice patio and lots of places to sit inside. ...  ... I have never had a poorly made mocha here and the staff has always been very friendly.   I have never had an issue with service when going through the drive-thru and the few times I have gone in they were equally pleasant and efficient.  ...  ... Not sure what all the hate is for.  If you are on Ray this is a pretty great location.

REVIEW #11:  4 stars  (1047 chars)
Well, I quit drinking coffee for a while trying to cut back on caffeine but now in 2014 I find that somehow that monkey is on my back again. Anyway, I mostly go to this Starbucks location since it is very close to my house right on my way to work. I usually use the drive thru and I will say that even when there is a long line it moves really fast. Everyone is very friendly and they always get my order right. I also love that they put in the little green plug that keeps your coffee from spilling even without me having to ask for it. ...  ... I still can't give them 5 stars because the reality is that Starbucks coffee is just not that good. But like most suburbanites, this is my most convenient option so I just go with it. I also think their food has gotten even worse after the recent menu changes; I am speaking specifically of their baked goods. I just can't stand it how they call those square shaped muffins of theirs scones. Go to a real bakery and find out what a scone is actually supposed to taste like and you'll see what I mean.

REVIEW #12:  3 stars  (725 chars)
Came to this location for the first time on Sunday morning around 11:30am. It wasn't very busy in the drive-thru so I decided to go that route. I ordered a venti caramel macchiato with soy milk and extra caramel. It came out great. Perfect amount of caramel, sometimes when you ask for extra it's like a caramel boat but this Starbucks got it right. Three stars because I also ordered a gouda, egg and bacon ciabatta sandwich off of their new bakery menu. It was horrible. The egg tasted liked powdered egg and the gouda had no flavor.  I would not suggest breakfast sandwiches here. The croissants are much better. The service was good. The baristas at the window were friendly and smiling. I will visit this location again.

REVIEW #13:  3 stars  (575 chars)
Oh, Starbucks. ...  ... It's like that horrible ex you can't stop going back to.  ...  ... Except, they're much closer to your neighborhood.  ...  ... And in some cases, a lot faster! Hardy, har har. ...  ... Really, 9 times out of 10 I'll take a locally owned coffee shop. ...  ... Yet, sometimes, you're having one of those rough "need extra caffeine!" kind of mornings. You see a Starbucks pop up on your commute and roll on in.  ...  ... This location? Super fast and friendly drive through service at 5AM.  ...  ... Three stars simply because no Starbucks is five stars.

REVIEW #14:  2 stars  (734 chars)
Okay, I get a starbucks pretty much every day. The same thing EVERYDAY. I had to go to chandler for a job and i needed my starbucks fix so i went into this one. everyone was nice and friendly and i think it is a pretty new starbucks. ...  They made my drink completely wrong so i politely went over and told them it didn't taste the same as my every day drink. She was nice to try and fix it but all she did was put it in the blender again and made it more watery. I tasted it again and then told her it just still wasnt the same. She got a little snippy and said that thats how its made and didnt care after that. So i went to a starbucks near by and asked if they could make a new one and it was exactly how its supposed to be made.

REVIEW #15:  1 stars  (1887 chars)
This location is larger than most Starbucks and in a very good location. It's too bad the service here is horrible. I've been to this location several times and had an issue each time. First time I went through the drive thru and ordered a grande black coffee.  I received my coffee in the grande cup, but it was only filled a little more than half way. Second time I went in and there was one person on the store phone (personal call), one person with their back toward waiting customers texting, and a third person ignoring customers while standing at the empty drive thru window. When a customer tried to get the texting girls attention, she actually moved away from the counter and started heading toward the drive thru window to finish texting. She seemed annoyed at the customer trying to get her attention. One couple in line left the store. The guy on the store phone finally turned around and told the person on the phone, "OMG, there's a line. I gotta go. Call you later". This guy then called for the texting girl to take a register. She sighed really loud, slowly made her way to the register, and proceeded to take the next customer's order while rolling her eyes at the male employee. The third  time I went to this location they were out of the two house coffees and needed to make a fresh batch. There wasn't any customer's after me, and very few people in the store. I was told they would bring it out to me. I sat down and began reading my book. After 15 minutes I realized I didn't get my coffee. I went to the counter. The two female employees were standing there talking.  One girl giggled, apologized and said she'll bring it out to me. She forgot to make the coffee! Whoever manages this location needs to know that the poor customer service and attitude is going to get this location closed really quick. I've taken my business to the other two near by locations.

Had to come back and update this review.  ...  ... I come by this Starbucks more often than I'd like to admit; it's by work. Will swing by once a week or so, and will have meetings here in the afternoon with my throws coach as it's close to the gym.  ...  ... Let's be honest: NO Starbucks is five stars. They're a dime a dozen, and you probably know what a "good experience" at a "good Starbucks" is like.  ...  ... Theresa, however, is what makes this place! And her team of awesome ladies!  ...  ... Always a huge smile on her face, even at 5:15/30 AM.  ...  ... Remembers me by name and follows up on previous conversations we've had. Knows my drink (Grande Pikes Place, no added sweetener), unless I go off into the deep end and order something crazy!  ...  ... The customer service here is the only why I'm upping the rating two stars. ...  ... Well done, Chandler and Kyrene team! :)

REVIEW #4:  4 stars  (417 chars)
Staff was very friendly! They always take a moment to chat me up while making my drink. And they always make my drink right. ...  ... The big windows get too much sun for the shades to compensate for, so half the seating of the store is too warm during our summers here in Phoenix. Sometimes its hard to find a seat on the cool-side during peak hours. ...  ... The net is always up and there is enough parking spaces.

REVIEW #5:  3 stars  (662 chars)
As much as I rag about "corporate coffee", I still come to Starbucks out of convenience from time to time. * cue gagging noises *  ...  ... This one happens to be on my drive to work! Sometimes you just need that extra caffeine hit after your morning wake-up cup or two at home. Don't judge!  ...  ... There's no drive thru; however, the place has a huge parking lot.  ...  ... The employees are always friendly and will either ask for your name or read it off your credit card. Me, usually in and out pretty quick - It's pretty hard to mess up  basic, non frou-frou iced coffee!  ...  ... Standard Starbucks quality; what did you expect?   ...  ... Recommended.

After faithfully going to this specific Starbucks for years, then moving away 8 months ago... I really miss this store location!! ...  ... I have yet to encounter a Starbucks as great as you. It's just not the same. Thanks for always getting my drink right, not being stingy, putting up with my indecisiveness and particular orders, your friendly attitudes, chatting with me about randomness, being my never failing pick-me-up... my real neighborhood coffee shop.

REVIEW #2:  5 stars  (345 chars)
All Starbucks are the same, right?  WRONG!  I work out of my car all over the valley, and yes there are other good locations, but everytime I walk into this store it is consistently top notch.  Many of the same baristas have been there for several years and they really make it seem like a good old fashioned neighborhood coffee shop.  Nice job!

Looking for a spot with wi-fi and friendly staff, this location is awesome. They recently did a redesign inside with more efficient seating and layout. There's plenty of spots with plug outlets to hook up the laptop and plenty of window spots with a view.  Location faces Alma School road, in the Alma Elliot Square center.

REVIEW #8:  5 stars  (1348 chars)
Many will argue that a Starbucks is a Starbucks. I agree that, much like Denny's, Starbucks tend to be a pretty consistent experience. The Starbucks at the corner of Alma School and Elliot is more. ...  ... Is the coffee so much better? Not really. Is the building amazing? Not at all. What is it that is special at this Starbucks? The people. ...  ... The customer service is simply phenomenal. There is a personal touch that brings a stream of regulars coming back daily. They often remember your name, drink, and even personal quirks. I'm sure if any of the staff is reading this, all I have to say is "small cup with a splash of water", and they know exactly who this is.  The staff goes beyond friendly and offers a "small town" feel to a sometimes busy Starbucks, without sacrificing efficiency. ...  ... The only complaint I have is that the outdoor tables are extremely unstable.  I think the welding has broken down.  It's hard to work on a laptop when the table pitches at a 45 degree angle at random.  It seems this is relegated to the "smoker" tables, but a little time fixing these would add a lot to the experience.  I work here a lot and always find this adding an unneeded challenge. ...  ... I highly recommend making a stop at this Starbucks.  I drive past three other ones from my home each time because it's definitely worth it.

This location lives up to the best Starbucks tradition. Clean and comfortable surroundings, skilled engaging staff, and good hours.

There is a reason why this location does well. Find it yourself.

I'm not really a fan of this location and usually go to the one by Target. ...  ... I went in because it was on the way to my sister's house and I wasn't impressed with the staff. In fact, they were kinda rude. ...  ... When I went in, the door was stuck and wouldn't open. An employee came around from the counter and opened it for me. He explained that it sticks when it's hot out and that most people just think they're closed and walk away. I made a joke saying, "Well I guess I need to start hitting the gym, huh?" Both employees just stared at me and smirked like, "This guy's an idiot." Feeling a bit uncomfortable I ordered my drink.  ...  ... When my drink was made, the barista didn't say anything, he just set it up on the counter and began making the next one.  ...  ... I felt really uncomfortable and like my business wasn't wanted. At the location by Target the employees are warm, welcoming, and friendly. I'll stick to that location from now on.

I am also not a fan of this Starbucks and I also will travel further to the other Starbucks on Shea.  Seems like everytime I would a latte it's really light and half the cup is filled with froth.  Feels cheated.   ... Shea location is much better.

I've visited this Starbucks 4 of the past 5 days for Frappucino happy hour and I could not be more pleased with each experience.  The girl working the register remembered my name after my first visit.  I'm surprised they are not busy during happy hour, but I'm sure that has to do with the "out of the way" location in Fountain Hills.  I'll be moving further away from this store soon and am disappointed I can't take them with me.  I rate this five stars because the staff is friendly and it's easy to park and run in.

REVIEW #5:  5 stars  (1203 chars)
Staff at this Starbucks, unlike most Starbucks in Scottsdale & Phoenix, actually exhibits happiness when customer walks up to the counter to order. Whether you get the morning crew of kindly beautiful women, or the afternoon crew of handsome manly men, you are made to feel like a blessing, not a chore. They all seem to know almost everyone by name, and if they don't remember your favorite drink, they will try to guess it. Moreover, these are efficient and skilled baristas, making my drink perfect every single time. And they are so attentive to the smallest nuance! One barista even noticed my lid was a bit cracked, and she came around the counter to replace it, without once interrupting my conversation with another customer. Who does that? Who even notices? Look for the barista with the gray page haircut. She'll take your coffee order like a U.S. Marine Lieutenant General while asking you about the NFL Playoffs and all the while beaming a Miss America smile that refreshes the most depressed day. Regardless of how tired I am, I'll pass by numerous Starbucks and fall asleep at the wheel doing so, in order to get my Mocha at this most singular establishment on Shea Blvd in Fountain Hills.

Staff that works early morning 6a-7:30a shift, M-F, are all FANTASTIC! I am always greeted w/a genuine, warm smile by whoever happens to be cashiering. Their drinks are always made consistently good too! ...  ... *Side Note Personal Pet Peeve: The family-on-vacation donned in shorts or the retirees (also in shorts) who take their sweet-ass time at 6:45am ordering their drinks/baked goods in front of me in line. They do a lot of squinting at the menu, hemming and hawing over choices, scratching their heads, stepping back, etc. NEWSFLASH: There are working ppl who are on a time crunch for their commute - step aside if ordering is too much for you!

Albeit a corporate-run company, this Starbucks maintains the feel of a small mom & pop coffee shop. All of the employees not only know their customers by name, but are also eager to engage in friendly conversation. Furthermore, despite being located in Fountain Hills, which has a predominately older demographic, they are able to handle the sometimes impatient crowd with a smile or a few words of ease. As for those complaining about the product, blah blah... come on, you're walking into a Starbucks... you know what you're getting into. I just appreciate this specific one so much more than other Starbucks because of the awesome people who work there. Four stars because they are still not Peets : )

I have been to A LOT of starbucks (Hey, there is one on every corner in Chicago!) but this one was memorable.  I was only visiting family for a week in Gilbert and probably visited this starucks more then I would care to admit in that week but they had my drink memorized and were extremely friendly.  No drive up and the parking lot can get a bit crowded in front of the starbucks but great inside.  Nice patio with 'misters' (I duno if that is correct terminology.  The little water sprayers to keep you cool) on the patio for days you want to sit outside.  This is a starbucks so I dont really have much to say about the food or drinks (you have all been to one.  You know what it's about) but this one never got my drink wrong.  The one by my house gets my drink wrong on a normal basis :/

This Starbucks is just great! The baristas and all workers alike have a very professional sense about them. They work fast and efficiently.

Great place.

Minus points because it would just be so much easier if this was in a location (within this strip mall) with a drive-through.

Who hasn't ever had some Starbucks? Well I guess people who don't drink coffee or anything they have to offer. I loved Starbucks ever since I was a pre-teen. I used to go to this Starbucks every morning before school started; they even knew my name and order. I thought that was super cool and it was...until I started realizing why I wasn't getting into the shape I wanted to be.  ...  ... They offer such yummy choices and I love it!! However, I have to limit myself going there...except if I am having straight Black Pike's Roast, then I don't really mind going. Everything else in there is a treat to me.  ...  ... The ambiance is so cozy and smells like home. I love coffee but if I go to Starbucks everyday,  maybe I'll get bored. So I am a fan, but hopefully, not anytime soon, become an obsessed fan.

Just a typical Starbucks but a long line-always. no drive-thru but patio seating if you bring your 4-legger which I did! why is it that my lattes always taste different at every Starbucks?

It is the closest to my house so that is where we stop when we have a lounging day together-that is my 4 legger and me:)

Though I like going to Starbucks for their drinks the real reason I go there is a place to get away and get work done on my computer.  I enjoy sipping my green tea lemonade while working on my computer.  This Starbucks has recently undergone a remodel.  Though I LOVE the location the remodel leaves me lacking.  The tables along the wall where there are plugs to plug in my computer are gone.  The center isle has now been replaced with a HUGE LONG table.  Not sure who is going to sit here.  Even if you do it sits in the middle of the floor so you have foot traffic all around you and there is no power outlets.  The remodel has added space for people to sit but has taken away from the coziness of the place along with the ability to reach an outlet.   ...  ... If you like working on your computer this is NOT the Starbucks to come to any longer.  If you are just want to grab a quick cup or coffee or coco on while out on a shopping excursion then stop on by because they will set you up with your caffeine buzz with a smile on their face.

Typical Starbs...but the baristas always have smiles on their faces, so I like to go.  It is the closest coffee places to my house, so I go often for a quick triple espresso.  They spell my name right, too (one T), without me ever having to say anything to them.  ...  ... This is right by Chipotle, Jamba Juice and Fatburger, off the 202.

REVIEW #6:  3 stars  (496 chars)
I don't know why, out of all the Starbucks in the Valley, this is one of the ones I'm fondest of. It's just your average Starbucks. The staff is friendly, the food and drinks are overpriced in comparison to some of the local coffee shops, there's free wifi, and it's on the comfier side of chilly during the summer.  ...  ... Also, there are two leather chairs in the corner that are ridiculously comfy and great if you're looking for a comfy spot to curl up in for a bit with a book and a drink.

REVIEW #7:  3 stars  (665 chars)
i wasn't sure which Starbucks I wanted to pick to write about.  I go to this one once in a blue moon (long story about this one), but there is also another one I frequent on Ray and the 101 (brand spanking new)  I also go to the one on University and Hardy in Tempe...but I have the same issues with each and every one of them...why do they have to be so friggin cheerful in the morning???  Stop it!  Nobody can be that upbeat at 6am...even after I drink my tea...I am nowhere near their cheeriness...STOP THE MADNESS!!!!! ...  ... Besides all of that...I do love my green iced tea and blueberry coffee cake (or Lemon Cake...i switch)...good stuff and convenient...

REVIEW #9:  1 stars  (299 chars)
The people here are awful. They were talking crap on my wife within earshot because of what she was wearing. I understand they work in one of the more "difficult" service industries but you'd imagine that the heaps of money their family has would be able to educate them enough to have some manners.

Friendly service here!  12 tables inside, 2 comfy leather chairs, lots of outside seating. Music wasn't too loud & general mood was mellow.   ...  ... No drive thru.  Services: Lunch, Oven-warmed Food, Sirena Espresso Machine, Starbucks Card Mobile, Wireless Hotspot. ...  ... I was impressed that their food case was so full on a weekday at 2:30pm (see pic): http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7ITv2jv4rB-UuQwAo2ntjw?select=sSu-8pjsWRNuhXxqu_Omdw ...  ...

I normally wouldn't even think to review a Starbucks, cuz really, why? Most people have probably been to one and they don't all differ too much. ...  ... I started composting, and people have told me that Starbucks gives away their coffee grounds (Barnes & Nobles doesn't - at least here they don't). I went there to ask for it and they put my name down and asked me when I could come pick it up. They said that they would start collecting it for me throughout the day when I was going to come. When I went to pick it up the other day, they really delivered! I had a ton of coffee grinds and it was perfect for the compost! ...  ... All the workers that I interacted with in this specific Gilbert location has been so friendly and helpful. Even when they were busy, they would make sure that I was helped. (I felt bad since I was just coming to pick something up.) ...  ... Definitely A+ for their service!

REVIEW #3:  5 stars  (481 chars)
I wouldn't typically review a place like Starbucks and I'm a little embarrassed to admit I pay almost $7 bucks for a beverage that doesn't have booze.  However, I had the best drink here and they deserve all my stars. ...  ... I get a hot, venti, chai tea latte, soy milk and 1 to 3 shots of espresso -- depending on my mood.  That's been my drink for the past 8 years and I had the best one EVER at this Starbucks recently.  It was so delish I slurped it down in under 20 minutes.

REVIEW #4:  5 stars  (312 chars)
Melissa is a Starbucker after my own heart.  On a hellish day that required 3 espresso shots I met Melissa.  She schooled me on how to order my drink so that it would be a dollar cheaper and also told me that if I paid with a Starbucks card that I would eventually earn my way to free soy milk.  You rock sistah!

I love going to this Starbucks.  It is such a pleasure to walk in and find Jessica, Becky and Josh there.  They are so efficient and pleasant.  I order a drink that is a bit tricky to understand and they get it right EVERY time!   I had to give 4 stars because I went in a couple of times and someone new made my drink.   But it will not alter my opinion.

REVIEW #7:  4 stars  (426 chars)
this Starbucks really care for customers service. I really hate myself for not remembering my barista name. they greet you as you walk in. if your a regular they greet not only by your name, but they know what you want already. they work on it so you can enjoy your lattes, frap, espresso, etc... right away. I love coming here at night to hang out, until their closed. if it does get hot the mist outside helps with the heat.

Trying something new! A mocha frapp...we'll see. Great atmosphere with places inside and out to just hang.

REVIEW #9:  3 stars  (812 chars)
This location of Starbucks is pretty good. The reason for the three stars is because as I was coming in the door of this Starbucks yesterday I was almost taken out by the girl who was taking out the very large trash can. I offered to open the door but she didn't hear me and almost ran over my foot with the trash can. Clearly her mind was somewhere else. Bad first impression. ...  ... The cashier who took my order was extremely friendly and cheerful. I ordered a caramel macchiato with extra caramel on the sides. They over did it a little bit on the extra caramel but I know that I walk a fine line whenever I order this drink with extra. Overall not bad. It's a Starbucks and I'm in this area a lot so I will be back. To the girl who was taking out the trash, just be more aware of your surroundings please.

REVIEW #10:  1 stars  (505 chars)
The coffee is to be expected as most Starbucks are the same.  It was the service that was disappointing.  When we got to the counter the 17 year old who apparently knows everything told us there would be a 15 min wait while they brewed more coffee????  What??  I asked why 15 mins, and was advised that was how long it takes.  I got back into my car, drove to Dunkin Donuts, walked inside, ordered and received my coffee in 12 mins...  yup, it was literally quicker to drive somewhere else and get coffee.

Starbucks is hurting my wallet by being inside grocery stores and now Macy's!!! However, I can't complain because they are always around when I need my fix! My favorite lately is the skinny vanilla latte since I am watching the calories. My all time favorite is the white mocha. The prices are creaping towards the insane but for convenience and consistent quality it is worth it. I don't like their coffe, hence the 4 stars. Just their espress drinks and green tea lattes! Staff is always friendly and fast at this location. When they were packed a couple weeks ago they had someone come out and take orders in line while someone was ringing and they got a line of about 15 people out in minutes! Very impressive!

REVIEW #2:  1 stars  (345 chars)
Every time I go through the drive thru I'm waiting for at least 20 minutes. I thought this was a fluke at first but tried a couple more times with the same result. Which sucks cause they are the only Starbucks with a drive thru by my house. Most of the time I have my toddler with me and don't want to have to get her in and out of her car seat.

Walked over from the Einstein's that it's attached to (big plus). People were friendly. I was barefoot and given no issues, so it seems to be barefoot friendly :).

REVIEW #5:  4 stars  (507 chars)
At first blush, this seems like a rather mediocre Starbucks. Two (or is it three) tables in a very small seating area. Look around the side of the building to see some nice outdoor tables, complete with fresh water squirted to cool you down, and it seems a little less average. What really makes this my most frequentest place for a buzz near campus? The amazing staff. Despite working for yet another soulless corporation, they create community and warmth easily bikeable from my apartment and grad school.

REVIEW #6:  4 stars  (582 chars)
I'm a total Starbucks... hell, coffee junkie! I like that this place is small and not too busy. The parking situation can be a bear sometimes since it shares spaces with Einstein Bagels and Blockbuster, but you can park a little across the way if it was really full so it's not extremely bad. Most of the time Starbucks is Starbucks, however I find that sometimes they don't make the drinks here consistently - at times they'll taste really sweet, sometimes too bitter. I guess it depends on how the barista was trained to make the drink. But as long as I get my coffee it's cool...

REVIEW #7:  4 stars  (520 chars)
This Starbucks gets the "Congeniality" award :D ...  ... Why? ... *They share a hallway with Einstein Bagels! 2 of my favs connected :) ...  ... Other things I like: ... *plenty of parking ... *never too large a crowd ... *friendly staff ... *police presence (there always seems to be 1 or 2 vehicles in the parking lot) ...  ... Areas for improvement: ... *a bit slow with getting the drinks out.  ... *although they ask you for your name, they don't call it out when your drinks ready, which causes a bit of confusion.

REVIEW #9:  3 stars  (739 chars)
The parking is crowded and awkward, but if you are already coming to this location for the bagels at Einstein Bros. next door then I suppose this is a decent Starbucks.  It is small - less than a dozen small tables- and was extremely busy on a Sunday morning.  The staff was friendly and helpful and the drink was made well (which is why I drove an extra mile and a half from the 43rd Ave and Thunderbird location).  The wait in line was over 10 minutes, but my drink was made quickly after I ordered. ...  ... I can't imagine sitting to study or work at this Starbucks, but I saw at least one person doing so. ...  ... As a side note, I do not like this new heated pastry thing they are doing.  I kind of like my scones cold or room temp.

REVIEW #11:  1 stars  (455 chars)
First time I have ever been to a Starbucks where the service was not friendly. No one made eye contact or even said thank you. I grabbed a snack box that was already opened and realized as I was paying. I informed the cashier and she just grabbed it and threw it and stated "anything else?" Then the barista added syrup to my iced coffee after I stated please no sweetener. There was no line and it still took 10 minutes to get a plain grande iced coffee.

REVIEW #4:  5 stars  (1972 chars)
Why on earth would I review a Starbucks, right? I mean, lets face it, Starbucks experiences are fairly run of the mill.  Anyone who hasn't had a beverage from Starbucks has probably just crawled out of their bomb shelter because their 30 year supply of freeze dried astronaut food has run out.  Once they get over the shock that the 'big one' never hit and there is no longer a USSR they will quickly have their first Starbucks experience.  But I digress.   I have one reason to leave this review:  the girl that ran drive thru that one time I went knocked my M F'ing socks off.   ... I don't often do Starbucks, however I am a sucker for one thing: you put the word salted in front of caramel and I am there. Starbucks did just that so there I was, looking for a salted caramel mocha fix before class.  No time, so I chose drive thru where I was greeted by the most chipper voice I have ever encountered.  Now one might think 'well yeah, if I was surrounded by untold amounts of caffeine I too would be perky at work.'  But no my friends, this was a whole new level of happy, whoville had nothing on her, the Grinch would have had no shot stealing cheer from this drive thru, his heart would have exploded.  Her sunny disposition would not have simply defeated the Grinch, it would have made him dead. ... She commended my salted caramel choice, I felt proud.  She suggested a venti, which is far too much caffeine for me but I could not resist.  She said I deserved it, and I believed her.  She was excited to swipe my credit card, complimented my hair, and handed me my beverage.   ... I didn't even need that coffee, her personality was infectious, I was ready to Carpe Diem!! or Yolo for the younger crowd. ...  ... Then someone stole my parking spot at school and that was over, but I still had the coffee and it was good. ...  ... Either way, that girl, whose name I don't know, that one time I went to this Starbucks knocked my socks off, and for that I thank her.

No longer my favorite Starbucks. Horrible customer service. Received bad service twice in 4 days. Apparently it is so hard to smile. Girl at the drive through really did not seem to care.

I'm been here numerous times and received *okay* service, but this last time it was just terrible! Typically I'm there to meet clients as Starbucks is generally a nice place to do so in a quiet, relaxing atmosphere.  ... Let's start by saying my name is Morgan. Yes Morgan, a unisex name. I am a girl and have known many Morgans both male and female. I've even run across a few unscrupulous business people who question if I am really Morgan (generally for credit cards, banks), however while they sound skeptical and ask more then the typical security questions, never, and I mean never, have I been so horrified and embarrassed as I was in this Starbucks. Nor have I ever met someone quite so ignorant and rude.  ... The other day, I went into the Starbucks with clients and when I handed my card to the cashier, he asked if 'he' was with me. When I replied "he?" the cashier continued to look around us (a group of females) and ask where was "he, Morgan". Apparently 'he' needed to be around to show his ID. My jaw dropped! I replied that I am Morgan to which he looked at me skeptically, sighed, then brashly stated that I needed to show him my ID.  ... Last I knew the appropriate way to handle this situation would have been to politely ask for my ID, not to assume (ignorantly so, mind you) that I am not the person on the card because, well, Morgan must be a male only name! More over, once he knew that I was in fact Morgan, being rude beyond that point was just uncalled for and unprofessional on so many levels. Worst yet, he never apologized, you would think for that much he would have. Nope, nothing. It certainly left a lasting imprint on my clients which had a few (mind you highly embarrassing) chuckles at my expense.  ... Thanks for the laugh. Guess I'll find somewhere else to waste my money.

Am always amazed at how different each Starbucks is in terms of service. Today I was here to redeem my "coffee bag" free cup. I asked to upgrade to an americano as I cannot drink the Pikes because of the acidity.   The girl ( in the drive-through) said she couldnt do that. I explained why I couldnt drink the Pikes and that I had done this before at a Starbucks with no issue but she still said no.   The store at 75th and Bell has an awesome crew and I continually go back there unless I am in a different area of town.

I suggest only going there if you have to because, afterall, it is a very convenient location.

I was visiting some relative in the area and stopped at this Starbucks.  I visit a lot of Starbucks and this store seems poorly managed.  The wait was 20 minutes for our  simple order after we paid.  The staff were more concerned about drive thru customers who paid after us than our order.  There were no tables inside so we went to sit outside.  As we were sitting outside the manager INTENTIONALLY shut off the misters when it was 110 degrees.  He claimed they stopped working. But they mysteriously shut off after our neighboring table complained about the poor service.

I would give this Starbucks a 0 but it doesn't let me. Today was the 4th time I was kicked out of a Starbucks when I had my Certified Therapy Dog with me. She has a vest and I have an ID I wear. I was told today my dog can't be in the store. I have spoken with SB "higher ups" in the past (when we were thrown out of other stores) and they say the staff cannot ask me about my dog or kick us out. It is against the law to throw a Certified Therapy animal out of anywhere. Starbucks has broken the law 4 times now. Not to mention humiliating & degrading me in front of other customers. I was called "Sweetheart" at another location (59th and Union Hills) in front if a packed store by an employee and was told I can't have my dog in the store, even though we were both clearly marked. Today was the last time SB is throwing us out. I have contacted several news outlets. They are not only rude but broke the law, numerous times. My dog is Certified and visits Nursing Homes and Hospitals. Starbucks, you threw the wrong duo out........again.

When you make a purchase at Lifeboat Coffee, $1.00 is donated to a pro-life organization! No more will i go to a Starbucks or buy their brand at a grocery store. ... In addition, the last time I was there, I got a caramel mocha. When I got on the freeway to take my first sip all it was was hot milk! Terrible, terrible ,terrible! I needed my caffeine!  ... And let's not forget the slow service!!!!!

REVIEW #3:  5 stars  (453 chars)
Hopefully I have the right location.  If so, this place is only "to-go".  There's some outdoor sitting but you can't go "inside" to order something. ...  ... I come here probably a couple times a month and I always get pretty good service.  Really chipper folks but I guess I would be, too, if I was serving coffee all day (and drinking it too - presumably!) ...  ... Even when the lines are long, it goes by pretty fast.  They've got it together there.

REVIEW #5:  5 stars  (460 chars)
I always get 5 star service here.  I'm most often there when I stop by and get a coffee on the way to the farmers market early Saturday mornings and it's almost always busy!  Luckly, busy doesn't seem to matter the employees always have a smile and are ready for a quick chat while you order or wait. ...  ... This location does seem to be a few cents more then others though, even the one just down the street near Target is almost a buck less with 2 coffees.

I was so sleepy so my boyfriend offered since it was on the way. It was drive thru only, there were 6 cars ahead of us but we got our coffee quick though. I love it! Very enthusiastic friendly drive thru people!

REVIEW #11:  5 stars  (772 chars)
This is THE best Starbucks. The service is always fast whether you go through the drive thru or walk up to the window. I go a few times a week and they always remember me and joke around with me as if we've known each other forever. The coffee is always good (I'm from Seattle, I know good coffee..), the food is typical Starbucks food (sandwiches, bagels, sugary treats!) and the staff is really just amazing. They never mess up my drink, unlike the Starbucks down the road, which is why I'll drive the extra couple minutes just to come here!  ... This location is mainly a drive thru location. You can walk up to the window, but you can't go inside. Convenient if you're driving through town and need a quick pick me up. OR...if you just want someone to smile at you. ;)

REVIEW #12:  5 stars  (327 chars)
This is the most pleasant Starbucks I have ever been to. There is always a polite person on the other end of the speaker when ordering and and even funnier and pleasant person when paying. I think they hire only these type of people which makes it a even more joyful experience while picking up your favorite starbuck beverage.

REVIEW #13:  5 stars  (273 chars)
This Starbucks location is fantastic! The staff is always friendly and the service is fast! The entire Real Estate Brokerage visits on a daily basis to get their morning started. Though it would be nice to have a lobby, the new renovated patio is perfect in warmer weather!

REVIEW #14:  4 stars  (263 chars)
A great kiosk style Starbucks!  I miss having the lobby, so that is the reason for the four stars.  The walk-up window is awesome and their newly re-vamped patio is a great place to spend a sunny Phoenix day.  The partners at this store provide excellent service!

REVIEW #15:  4 stars  (566 chars)
I would call this location, "my starbucks".  I frequent Starbucks about three times per week but the funny part is I only drink the iced tea.  I love this starbucks because of its location which is about a mile north off the I-10 on Dysart rd.  I also like how its an "express" location because it means people, like myself, just want to get a drink and go.  I don't really care for the coffee shop experience, so this place is great for me.  I give it 4 stars because I want my ice tea very cold when its served and there have been times where it has not been cold.

REVIEW #16:  4 stars  (127 chars)

REVIEW #19:  4 stars  (377 chars)
My Friday morning treat, being from Seattle I have to enjoy Starbucks from time to time and Friday is normally it.  This is a drive-thru (and walk up) only location which for that time of day is perfect for me since I don't need to take extra time getting out, going in, coming back and then leaving.  Staff is always very friendly and pretty quick in getting your order ready.

New furniture and updated look.  Heard they are going to open another one in Frys so there will be two right next to each other.  Wow!!! I have never had any problems at this location.  It is the typical Starbucks.

REVIEW #7:  3 stars  (363 chars)
It's a Starbucks.  Nothing special or bad about the place.  Usually I stay away from Starbucks but this one is convenient next to the Frys that we shop at.  Starbucks just opened inside the Frys, so not sure how long this place will be around as they are next door to each other.  I will be going to the Starbucks in the Frys from now on just because of convince.

REVIEW #8:  2 stars  (322 chars)
Music is too loud (obnoxious) and the internet sucks, slow. I love Starbucks but at night this more like a nightclub, but you know without the people. Currently using my phone to tether just to do the homework I can barely do because it is so friggin loud here. But this is just the humble opinion of one gold card holder.

REVIEW #9:  1 stars  (437 chars)
Horrible service every time I come. Id give NO STARS IF I COULD! Order either doesn't get done or they ask for your name and don't call it and someone takes your drink.  Here's a noble concept, some people actually sometimes order the EXACT drink.  ...  ... My sandwich was taken by someone who ordered the same thing. Only thing I got was a the obligatory Sorry.  Last time I ever go to Starbucks. Thank god Dutch bros is down the road!

REVIEW #10:  1 stars  (1337 chars)
If you want a burned cup of overpriced coffee and then be served by "Barrista's from Hell", go to this Starbucks.  I've been here several times passing thru on appointments and EVERY time I go there, the barrista's have a nasty attitude, like you are lucky they are even going to take your order after waiting a couple of minutes at the counter this tall, gangly, brunette with big glasses FINALLY turned around and took my order without offering an apology for the wait. I went next door to the barber and wanted to give him a tip but he didn't have any change so I went back to this Starbucks that I was just in 15minutes prior and asked if they could break a Ten dollar bill. The same moron has the gall to state (again with NO APOLOGY) that she couldn't break the bill unless I bought something!!  I just bought something!! It's Starbuck's policy she nastily responded. I said that is a lie!! I go to other Starbucks and have never had a problem getting change, not that I have done it that often, but it's called customer service!!  What a poor excuse for a "thinking human being" barrista and Starbucks should clean this entire site out. Close it up or get some people that care, want to provide good customer service and most importantly, like their job and want to be there!!  WILL NEVER GO HERE AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I have to say this Starbucks is the best.  They know who you are what your drink is and are very personable.   they are awesome I have not seen another Starbucks like this ever.  They  don't argue in front of the customers as I have seen many times before.   They ask how are you doing and don't just talk to each other (ignoring the customer)  as I have seen before at other  Starbucks.   They are awesome.  I had to relocate to another state.  Sadly I will miss this Starbucks they are simply the BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

REVIEW #3:  5 stars  (429 chars)
Vikki just blew my mind, she made me and my bf the best drinks we've ever had at Starbucks, most make the Java chip too sweet and this is perfect and some make my favorite Italian cream soda too watered down and always forget the whipped cream but again it's perfect. She offered us desserts, we bought them and did everything timely and with a friendly cute smile. This is my new Starbucks Bc of of her, make sure u leave a tip!

You always know what you ate going to get when you are at starbucks, but you can't always assume it will be a great experience. Here you can. Everyone who works here is a great person and they amazongly remember so many peoples faces, names and drink orders. A lot of the regulars are great people too. This is also a pretty nice location to study with a table that seats 4 with outlets, 3 two peron table with outlets and the two comfy leather chairs also have tgeir own outlets

Need to improve service. The cashier is nice but slow. Drinks came out slow. They had one training barista making all the drinks. He kept asking questions to the cashier. It just looked like they didnt have enough people working. My drinks were not up to par. The only nice thing was one drink was free because it was taking them extremely long. It just didnt seemed well managed. I would rather drive little bit farther for better experience.

REVIEW #11:  2 stars  (363 chars)
I have to come to this Starbucks because its the only one in my area between home and work. Too bad its the slowest Starbucks I've EVER visited. It seems like they could use their staff more wisely when a rush comes in. There is no sense of urgency when taking your order or preparing it. Just leaves me feeling frustrated. Staff is nice at least, maybe too nice.

REVIEW #12:  2 stars  (505 chars)
It's the bare minimum that you would expect from Starbucks. I have never been able ti order a breakfast sandwich because they always run out before 10am. When asked how many sandwiches they usually carry the lady told me only 7! No wonder they always run out. They are only good for making you a drink at a mediocre pace. And don't expect much from these baristas, They have a sense of entitlement to the place that subtly overwhelms the customer service. Handle the stress ladies, its just a coffee shop.

REVIEW #13:  2 stars  (330 chars)
Love the shop. Love the baristas. Love the coffee. Hate the smokers who swarm the outside patio and make drinking coffee outside hell for non-smokers. The friendly staff has no interest in enforcing the non-smoking city law and Starbucks policy!  If you are a non-smoker, it is inside or nothing.  If you smoke, the patio is open!

REVIEW #7:  4 stars  (2259 chars)
Imagine this: I had just driven 3 days from Minnesota to Arizona.  I knew that my favorite coffee shop in Minnesota, Caribou Coffee, didn't exist in the desert southwest.  Tired, a bit intimidated, and craving coffee, I find my first local Starbucks about 2 miles from where I live.  I park my car and walk up to the store, and from the moment the coffee aroma hit me, I knew I had found a place I could get away, drink great coffee, and relax reading my book, just like I had done back home.  The baristas (at least 2 or 3 of them) are extraordinarily friendly.  I had an extended conversation with one about Near Eastern and Asian culture and languages, which blew my mind. That had never happened to me before, and it brought a profound joy to my heart.  I had spent nearly 30 years in MN and I had never encountered such friendly staff *anywhere*, not even in the coveted "uptown" area of Minneapolis (known for being down to earth, organic, open minded folks).  I felt immediately welcomed in a strange land, one in which I wasn't yet comfortable.  I don't have much money, but this Starbucks gets what little dollars I do have; it gives me an escape, a feeling that I am "home", and that sense of community I so dearly miss.  I've spend many hours in their cushy chairs, either applying for jobs on my laptop, or reading a book out of my favorite series.  I don't know what I would've done if I hadn't found this Starbucks in my first few days in Arizona.  I know, many of you would say, "Gee, Starbucks?  Really?  Couldn't you have found a more local coffee shop?"  No.  I couldn't have.  I'm broke, and I have no internet access where I live.  To stumble upon this shop was awesome; I was never a fan of Starbucks when I lived in MN, but now, I'm a huge fan.  At certain hours of the day, you can't find a place to sit, but that makes it all the more warm and friendly.  People here don't seem to mind if you sit directly next to them when it's busy (Minnesotans apparently really like their personal bubble).  I give it 2 thumbs up, but you'll have to see it for yourself.  I may be merely a lonely traveler looking for something familiar, but I was impressed with the service, the friendly faces, the product and the cleanliness of this coffee shop.

We went in here to kill some time before a movie. The people were nice and helpful. The menu is easy to read and there is a decent amount of seating inside.  ...  ... Our drinks didn't take long to make and were tasty.

REVIEW #9:  1 stars  (712 chars)
My sister and I stopped in her after a movie to enjoy some coffee.  I am a frequent flyer of Starbucks and visit them at least 3 times a week.  I had never been to this particular location before and I will NEVER go back!  The barista was so rude, like, unbelievably rude.  And of course she didn't have on a name tag so....She was thin, brunette, mouse-y looking.  I politely asked her for a couple of waters to go along with my order and she ROLLED HER EYES at me and said "Yeah ok".  When I then tried to confirm my order was correct with her, she acted all offended and said "I'm sure it's right ok?" again, with a very rude tone.  I've never been treated this way at a Starbucks.  They should be embarassed.

REVIEW #10:  1 stars  (939 chars)
Sad how Starbucks lost its customer service edge that they were known for...  Headline - A Seattle company that lost its Pacific Northwest roots.  My daughter had saved up some coupons for the new Fizzio soda.  She was so excited to have daddy daughter date with our start at Starbucks.  The team member lady was extremely rude and loudly said "we can serve you because these coupons are expired."   I said "serve us???"   "Ok.  We don't need to have a drink here if you can't serve us".  I don't think she meant it they way it came out but her attitude was so bad that we just left.  My daughter was very sad and embarrassed about the explosion from the team member.    The real bummer is they were two days past.  Ha!  The old Starbucks would have said, glad to help you.  Enjoy your drink.  Instead of inferring, your an idiot why don't you just leave.   Hope they take some time a coach that poor young lady before she does this again.

REVIEW #6:  5 stars  (467 chars)
I wouldn't normally check in or rate a Starbucks I go to because they're all pretty much the same. I believe this particular location recently went through a new facelift (remodel). It looks different from all the other Starbucks I've been to: High bar tops and community tables, nice outdoor setting, and open space. The setting reminds me of some of a few coffee places I've been to in NYC. Maybe that's why I like it so much. Oh and the baristas are welcoming too.

I love this Starbucks...well I love everyone that works there, save for one redheaded surly girl. My cousin and I call her Sister Surly and the moment we see her, we head on off to the other Starbucks on Dobson and Warner. ...  ... It's your typical Starbuck's fare -- coffee and pastries. ...  ... Next door is  Jamba Juice, across the parking lot is a Massage Envy and then next door to that is the Good Egg. You can have breakfast and then go to Starbuck's after. ...  ... Overall, this Starbuck's is my favorite in the Valley...except when Sister Surly works...

REVIEW #14:  4 stars  (523 chars)
I'm a big Starbucks fan, but I had to take away a star from this location for a few major reasons for a guy-on-the-go (residential real estate agent) like me.  They don't have a drive-thru AND their parking lot is almost always packed!  The parking lot being packed isn't always because everyone's at Starbucks - it happens be in a very busy plaza - but it doesn't change the fact that it is major pain to hunt for 10 minutes for a parking spot for a cup of coffee that only takes me 3 minutes to order and receive!  Aaugh!

REVIEW #15:  4 stars  (437 chars)
I've come here a few times in the past, and now that Starbucks has free WiFi, I've found myself coming in on a more consistant basis.   ...  ... I like it here because they have plugs at enough tables that I can sit with my laptop and not be restricted to just a few seats in the place.  Hours are great, and they obviously offer a variety of drinks and pasteries to choose from.  Service is great, and all around a good clean Starbucks.

REVIEW #16:  4 stars  (475 chars)
Mmmmm starbucks, who doesn't like starbucks as it is?? This location is one of my faves because it's right by school! There are plenty of outlets around for my laptop and the employees are all so nice! And if you go with someone who doesn't like or want coffee, well there's a Jamba right next door! The only downfall I have found so far is sometimes it gets a little noisy in there. Great place to meet up with study buddies, but a little too loud for me to study on my own.

REVIEW #17:  4 stars  (434 chars)
This particular Starbucks has great customer service, there usually isn't a line, and they always have a smile on their face. HOWEVER, the parking in this plaza is something else to speak of. They don't have a drive-thru so being that I'm always on the go and need to be quick, it makes it difficult. I know that I can find a parking spot around the corner and walk to the door, however, it makes it difficult when I need to be quick.

The customer service is fine. The atmosphere is fine. The quality if beans are terrible. They purchase they're beans at a low cost and roast them black so they don't taste like crap beans but they are. Longer the roast, more acidic it'll come out. And no one likes acidic coffee. So I go to local coffee shops that bug their beans locally of roast it them selves.  If you like good coffee you don't like starbucks. I've worked in coffee for 6 years and have been to 5 roasters so I know.

It helps to know that I give Starbucks in general great reviews because I love it so much.  This starbucks gets 5 stars because the people there are so kind. I have met a different person every time I've been there, and each person is not only nice but personable.

This is the drive-thru Starbucks closest to my home and conveniently located near the 60. I always receive friendly warm service here. Last night I pulled into the line 5 minutes after they closed (I didn't realize this at the time) and someone inside noticed me. I was served and they didn't even tell me I arrived after closing until I asked what time they closed. ...  ... That's my idea of customer service that exceed expectations!

This Starbucks is always so darn friendly! Never a bad service! ...  ... What can I say? I'm a repeat customer. Why? Well, not only because they're darn friendly! Also because they offer more than coffee! Their coffee is great and all, but I really enjoy trying their panini's and refreshers. Yum! ...  ... I am amazed at how consistently happy and courteous the customer service is here. Is it like this at all Starbucks? I may never know. I like it too much here to try anywhere else on purpose.  ...  ... I've been to other Starbucks and the service varies. Here, it's awesome all the time!

With a vast majority of Starbucks locations in this world, you pretty much know what you are going to get.  What sets one Starbucks apart from another is the staff, and the staff at this location is top notch.

Aside from my crack addiction-like need for multiple shots of espresso daily, the friendly faces of these baristas make my morning each and every day.

It's a Starbucks.  It's not an outstanding one, but it doesn't suck. ... The baristas smile.  I've never had a screwed up order (but then again, I order tall Americanos.

Drive thru takes far too long and parking is terrible in the morning. If you have the time to wait then the staff is very friendly!

We happened to be out this way and saw the drive-thru.  I had an iced pumpkin spice latte.  I don't know what they did but it was super strong and tasted bitter.  Being that I was a mile  down the road and about to get on the freeway before I tasted it, I didn't go back.  I drank as much as I could but it just didn't taste right.  And I know my coffee and I especially know my Pumpkin Spice Lattes!  I love those darn things!!  My daughter had a chocolate chip frap and that was fine....maybe the chocolate covered up the bitter taste....but I will think twice before I go back to this Starbucks.

REVIEW #21:  3 stars  (367 chars)
You know what you're going to get when you go to a Starbucks. This is a clean location, with a drive thru window, and speedy service. To get to the drive thru you do have to drive around to the back of the building. For the most part I try to avoid Starbucks for local independent coffee shops. In a pinch though you know what they have and can get your caffeine fix.

REVIEW #22:  2 stars  (406 chars)
Coffee has went down. No big deal anymore.  They used to also have a good sweet selection.  Got a chocolate chip cookie which cost over $2 and it was as thin as a mint, and no bigger than a chip ahoy.  Also got a scone which used to be very good. Now they come in a plastic wrap, individually wrapped. That means mass produced and not local anymore. Tasted like one you get at Fry's.  $10 for this garbage.

Ohkay, So I was working 3rd shift this day, Went throu the drive throu got a Carmel Machiatto. These people, over flilled the coffe to where when they handed it to me, and i put the straw in it over flowed onto my work scrubs! not to mention the coffee was burnt!! ...  ... I mean yeah more for your money but not when its all over you and you hav burnt coffee..... SO.... Taste before you drive off!! Not to mention, when I went back to get "Fresh" coffee, they were totaly rude about it!

REVIEW #24:  1 stars  (1378 chars)
Horrible service: as per previous reviewer, I concur, the girls working on the weekend here were really horrible. I think they specifically pick them from the Juvie section.  ... Went here for my morning Joe, always the same  ...  ... Me: "Short doppio machiato"  (lingo I learnt at other starbucks. ) ... Girl at counter (GaC): "Wha, Wha can't hear you"  ... Me: Repeated order ... GOC: "Wha what can't hear you!!" ,(after taking off her headphones) "Oh!, a machiato... oh yeah..."  ... Me: (thinking)Thank heaven for small miracles ...  ... On getting my coffee (5 minutes a tad late given I was the second in line) I guess gossiping about their boyfriends was more important. The coffee was filled to the brim with milk. Not looking good!!! ...  ... Me: Did you put milk in the machiato order? ... Girl who made the coffee: Yeah!! why? (rudely) ... Me: well machiato is only supposed to have foam. ... Girl: Oh.. (making a deriding face) ... Me: Um!! (flabbergasted at the poor service... and I thought Starbucks paid these people higher and trained them rigorously.  ) ... Girl: Why U want me to make it again? then mimed deridingly  below her breath "Machiato doesnt contain milk"  ...  ... at this point I was quite sure she would end up spitting in my coffee or do some insidious act. So had to walk of with my milky unwanted coffee wishing I hadn't paid up front for it.

I wish they had an option for NO stars!  My daughter went on 1/4/14 evening to pick up something to drink before getting her fianc from work.  While there she misplaced her keys.  When she realized it she back tracked and asked workers in Starbucks if anyone had seen them.  There were about 5-6 employees there at the time.  They said no.  She searched the restroom, the store, the outside seating, her car, etc.  She then remembered tossing trash out so she dug through the trash to no luck.  She texts me to bring the spare keys and we drive 15 minutes to the store.  While there we are all trying to trace back the steps in looking through trash, cars, restrooms, etc.  No luck.  An employee that was leaving came up and asked my daughter if the keys had a distinct look, she said yes.  He said oh we found those the restroom and thought they were the stores and put them in the safe.  Really!   At this point my daughter is upset and starting to breakdown, it took them 5 minutes to open the safe and there they were.  Did I mention that my daughter is 9 months pregnant and due in 4 days from this incident.  Yeah, no one at this store offered to help her even though they saw her trying to dig through the trash.  No offers to help look for them, nothing.   And when the keys were returned, no apologies for holding the keys for now an hour.   My daughter was upset for the next hour as she felt this store employees ignored her situation and not 1, not 1 person offered to help.  This is very sad. ...  ... Very Disappointed in this stores Employees that worked the evening of 1/4/14.

Always fast here! Love that I don't have to give myself 15-20 minutes extra anymore to get coffee at the Starbucks by my house because now I found this one by work and only spend 5-10 minutes here without having to worry about being late. Only thing is that the cars in line don't pay attention when the lines moves because it moves so fast. If they got off their phone and paid attention it would go ever faster!

I'm pretty much here every morning...even jumped a few curbs and did a few illegal things to get in the drive thru line. Yes, i have a green tea addiction..GUILTY. ...  ... Always really quick here both in the drive thru and if you get out and walk up to the window you get fast service as well. ...  ... TIP: if you need ur caffeine in the morning and you are usually in a rush you might want to give yourself 10 extra minutes and get here no later than 7:05am- after that traffic and feigns get crazy! ...  ...  trust me i know.

REVIEW #4:  5 stars  (543 chars)
This Starbucks location just opened a couple weeks ago about 1 minute from my house but yesterday was the first time I actually made a trip by.  I used the drive thru and the person asked right away what they could get for me and repeated my order back to me to make sure it was right, which it was.  When I pulled up to the window the girl there was super friendly with a big smile which always puts me in a good mood.  My drink was ready right away and I was on my merry way.  I will definitely be making this Starbucks a part of my routine!

REVIEW #5:  5 stars  (359 chars)
This was my first time at this location, and my experience definitely made sure it won't be the last. The person who took my order was very friendly, definitely a good thing on a Monday morning before caffeine. When I arrived at the window, my drink was ready, so I was in and out - with a perfectly blended frapp to boot! I would highly recommend this one :)

REVIEW #6:  4 stars  (304 chars)
Gotta love a hot cup of joe! This location is super convenient as it is on the way to work, had a drive thru, and has outdoor seating if you want to hang out for a bit. My only issue with this location is that the lines get long and the parking lot is tight to navigate. Otherwise, it's a solid location.

Awwh SB's, how i love thee and your caffeine. I have been to this location a few times now and i have had excellent service each and every time i have been in (or) gone through the drive-thru. They do have free Wi-Fi inside you are looking for a place to chill.  ...  ... Recommendations for drinks:  ... * Black Tea, Green Tea or Passion Tea Lemonades are very refreshing.  ... (I prefer w/no classic syrup and just add a little raw sugar, but i like these drinks less sweet than most folks.)  ... * Black Tea Iced plain is really good too. ... * Cool Lime Refresher is delightful as well. ... * Chai Tea Latte Iced (sometimes i like it dirty too....... get your mind out of the gutter "dirty" means they add a shot of espresso.) ...  ... Recommendations for treats: ... * Almond Croissant ... * Blueberry Oat Bar ... * Reduced-Fat Pumpkin Cream Cheese Loaf Cake ... * Cheesecake brownie

Being a former Barista it is hard to find a Sbux that really gets me going.  I live in Scottsdale but happened to be in the area of this Sbux.  Even though they are a busy store, they seem to make every customer feel like they matter and not just a transaction.  Drinks were made quickly and pastries were fresh.  The really great partner (Clint) even offered to warm my morning bun up to me, even though he was busy getting other pastries!!  What a great barista!!!! ...  ... The store was one of the cleanest I have ever been in, which is amazing considering their busyness! ...  ... I would definitely be back to this location!!!  Amazing job everyone!!

I can't even.. This place, man. Being a regular has its perks. Every time I walk in there in the morning, Brittie welcomes me - "Hey Tate! We doing the usual today?" As well as making me feel like a valued customer, as well as a friend - I see that other customers appreciate it too. ...  ... On top of the fantastic customer service, my order is always, needless to say, correct. Iced Carmel/Vanilla Latt, and a Bacon Artisan Sandwich.  ...  ... Side note, finally achieved my Gold Card on the rewards program.  ...  ... Couldn't be happier with this location, as well as the company overall. A++++

A few great things about Starbucks: ... 1. You'll always be able to find one, even if you missed the one half a block earlier. ... 2. You'll always get the same great tasting coffee, no matter the location. ... 3. You'll walk out smelling like coffee if your stay is anything beyond getting it to-go. ...  ... This particular location is no exception to the rule.  That being said, if you like Starbucks coffee, you'll like it here.   ...  ... Living close to this store and visiting semi frequently, I've been able to observe its ups and downs. ...  ... Ups: Free WiFi!  Day crew is awesome: they have always taken great care of me and are incredibly polite.  Outdoor seating with spraying water overhead in the summer makes it very pleasant.  Restrooms are generally clean.  Food selection is growing.  Drive thru available! ...  ... Downs: I always smell like burnt coffee after sitting in the store for any duration of time.  ...  ... To conclude, this is your typical Starbucks coffee shop and does well to keep you buying coffee with their ever so faddy Tall/Grande/Venti paper cups and free WiFi.  Way to go Starbucks marketing department!

REVIEW #7:  3 stars  (328 chars)
I come here all the time. There are two things to be said about this location. The drive thru is painfully slow, you will wait on average 20 minutes (going inside is not much quicker either). That being said, the staff has always been very nice to me so I can't complain there...which is why I keep coming back despite the wait.

REVIEW #8:  2 stars  (754 chars)
I should've listened to the other reviewers. Rude and annoyed. That describes the people working there on the particular day I was there. They seemed annoyed that people were there to order coffee!  The cashier was rude and rolled her eyes when someone said "Oh!  Can I also get a pumpkin muffin?"  It made me uncomfortable. I ordered a peppermint mocha and when I took a sip it was soooooo strong I felt like I did a shot of peppermint schnapps!  I went to the counter and said "I think there's an extra shot of peppermint in here. It's really strong". The girl took it from me and made me another one. Never said a word. Not a sorry, not a oh no let me make you another one.....nothing. I guess I'll stick with what I know and not change up my routine.

REVIEW #9:  2 stars  (1308 chars)
I visited this Starbucks around 10 a.m. on the day after Christmas. It's a hot spot, evidently, as the drive thru line was long AND there was a line halfway to the door inside.  ...  ... I chose to park and go inside. It was the slowest moving line I have seen at a Starbucks in a while. I ordered my drink "a tall nonfat latte, one pump gingerbread," which is how I was taught to order the drink at another location I visit occasionally because, I was told, they don't charge for one pump.  ...  ... The girl behind the register put my drink in as a "nonfat gingerbread latte" and charged me for the $0.40 difference. When I attempted to correct my order, "I actually just want a latte with one pump gingerbread," her retort was "it's only like $0.20 difference."  ...  ... WELL, Miss Moneybags, it's $0.40 different. And, because of your unwillingness to accept my order as placed, I paid you for additional pumps of syrup, whip cream and God knows what other goodies you put on top of a gingerbread latte... because, I certainly don't know... I only PAY for the crap, thanks to you, I don't actually take my drink that way!  ...  ... So, yeah, "I have had better" and I don't think I will be back. I'll hit one of the 80-bajillion other locations within a .5 mile radius, next time I'm in the East Valley.

REVIEW #10:  2 stars  (333 chars)
Not impressed with this location as they managed to mess up an easy order. I ordered a Hot Skinny Vanilla Latte, Decaf and I ended up with an ICED Skinny Vanilla Latte. Since I was in a hurry, I had to take the drink instead of getting the correct one. Upon review of my receipt, it had been put in as a ICED latte. ...  ... Oh well.

REVIEW #11:  2 stars  (233 chars)
pretty busy at around 7 AM on a friday... i waited 20 minutes for my drink and they forgot my peppermint! :/  not the best starbucks experience i've had.  BUT they do have a drive-thru.  wonder if that line would have moved faster...

REVIEW #12:  2 stars  (451 chars)
Service here is extremely slow. Waits in the drive thru are an average of 15-20 minutes I've waited longer if the line reaches the end of the drive thru. Inside is not much better.  ...  ... Simple iced caramel macchiatos are made differently by most baristas so they rarely taste the same. ...  ... Other than that the store is always clean.  ...  ... For as busy as this store is they need an extra barista because the wait times here are ridiculous

REVIEW #13:  2 stars  (911 chars)
The kids and I LOVE Starbucks but this one leaves a lot to be desired.. We have been here a hand full of time and each time I keep asking myself why do I go back to this one?  ...  ... The service there is almost rude. They seem as if they are annoyed to be busy. They never seem to be happy to service you. Drinks take forever to make, even though they aren't as busy as other ones are. We won't even go into the fact that my order has been messed up the last 2 times. ...  ... The main issue I have is the fact that 3 out of 5 times when sitting and relaxing with a snack, someone has to sweep the floor near me. Really? While I am sitting there? ...  ... There are much better Starbucks and I think I am going to try some others locally. ...  ...  ... 12/06 - The kids and I went in today for our "snack" wanted to say things were better today. I am not going to change my rating until after my next visit ;)

It's Friday afternoon 2:45 pm you'd think the drive thru would be quicker than the last time I was in it (on a Sat 22min), nope 10 minutes. 2cars ahead of me. I'm not ever coming back to this one. What a joke.

REVIEW #2:  5 stars  (412 chars)
I've been a morning regular here for many years and I drink my fair share of coffee. This is probably the most consistently good and friendly Starbucks I have visited in the valley. Keep it up, guys!  ...  ... I don't do a lot of afternoon/evening coffee, so I can't comment too much on that except to say that the place is fairly quiet in the afternoons and the people who work then seem to be just as friendly.

REVIEW #3:  5 stars  (612 chars)
Never thought I would be reviewing a Starbucks, but I had to mention this one.   ... Went here a few nights ago.  In front of the store the seats were crowded.  I expected a wait inside.  Instead, the service was fast and friendly.  I ordered only a water and a cookie.  The person I went with ordered a coffee and said it was very good. ...  ... The next morning, I realized I had left my planner behind.  When I asked about it, I had barely gotten the question out to the barista when she said, "Yes."  She promptly went back to get it and this is the main reason this Starbucks gets the great review. Service.

REVIEW #4:  5 stars  (805 chars)
Thought I should make use of another buy one get one free coupon for myself & my son. We chose another location because previously when using the same coupon at a different location for the 1st time we had received a difficult time. I was leary about using the same type of coupon again but needed an afternoon pick me up. We went through the drive through and I made sure to mention the coupon, it was like night and day. Meagan whose smile you could hear through the speaker was a breath of fresh air. She said "no problem", we got our order quick without any issues. Meagan was super sweet and even my son commented on how nice she was. and made it a point to say thank you and goodbye to her. My son suggested that I should meantion her on Yelp, so here I am. Meagan thank you, you brightened our day!

I LOVE Starbuck's and I LOVE the people at this location HOWEVER, the service is always so incredibly slow.  Last weekend I waited in line (inside) for 28 minutes for my drink and spinach feta wrap.  That is a long time.  A few weeks prior I waited for 35 minutes in the drive thru.  If there were no cars behind me I would have backed out.  BUT....My food and beverages are always good.

This is a great Starbucks! The Manger Leighton is always so friendly. I used to just go to this bucks while visiting my boyfriend and they would remember my drink and order. Now that I live here it's as if they know when I am about to walk in the door. The team is friendly and the place is always clean.  In addition to all this The team knows about current specials and the goings on with Starbucks so that's cool.

REVIEW #10:  1 stars  (566 chars)
I'm such a fan of Starbucks and this is the one closest to my house. It's terrible. The wait times are extra long, at least 10 minutes and often 20 or more in the  mornings. I would also estimate 1 out of every 5 of my drinks have been wrong, usually adding sweetener to an unsweetened order. I hate to admit, I still go frequently but not if I'm leaving the neighborhood and have another store to choose on my way.  ... Double check your drinks and budget plenty of time into your stop and you should be ok. If not, it's a very frustrating location, save your time.

REVIEW #11:  1 stars  (1155 chars)
Why does everyone like Starbucks? Its always busy and It's overly priced, overrated coffee. I only stop by here if I forget to make my blend the night before and if I am going to school/work and I'm too tired to function. Well I stopped by here around 9 am and the drive thru was super packed (of course) so I went inside. I looked around, only saw a couple of people so I thought everything was going to be all good. Well I ordered an iced coffee, nothing too complicated, the guy asked me my name so I told him. A few minutes later the guy was calling out Sarah a bunch of times and I looked around and I was the only female in there. I just assumed this Sarah girl had left early. Well 20 freakin minutes later I still didn't have my coffee so I went up to the front and asked the dude where my coffee was. He said he was calling my name a bunch of times but I didn't come up to get my coffee. My name is Callie, like California. Not Sarah. I don't know how he managed that to mess up. When I finally did get my coffee, it tasted like crap. Circle k has better coffee than this. I'm going to stick to making my own brew, saves me some more cash anyway.

This Starbucks is my favorite! I stop in fairly frequently and the service is always consistently great! It is a very busy location so wait times are sometime long, but it is always worth the wait. The atmosphere inside is nice, very relaxing, and not crowded at all. The baristas are friendly and remember the regulars. The only downside to this location is the parking situation. There are not many spots and sometimes the drive-thru line can back up making it hard to manuver in the lot. Aside from the parking issues I recommend this location when people are looking for a great Starbucks!

REVIEW #6:  3 stars  (243 chars)
Like this place, the baristas are really nice but there is no comfortable seating. Really wish they had some cushion chairs. I have my car worked on down the street and hang out while it's getting fixed and the hard chair are bad for the back.

REVIEW #7:  3 stars  (430 chars)
This Starbucks (located at Power & Broadway in east Mesa) just opened a few months ago. It is located a block from Banner Baywood and Banner Heart hospitals, so they get extremely busy between 0600 and 0730am with hospital employees running in, or using the drive-through, to get their morning dose of caffeine.  ...  ... Staff members have been great during each of my visits and the inside has the usual ambiance of a Starbucks.

REVIEW #8:  2 stars  (918 chars)
No complaints about the drinks every drink I've ordered from here has been good, my complaint is about the wait. Yes it does get the AM rush 6-730, but so do other locations. One morning I decided to go inside to order my drink thinking it would be faster versus the extremely long drive thru line.... i was WRONG... I went in about 640 ordered my drink, a shaken green tea lemonade.. and I did not get my drink until 657.. which is RIDICULOUS for a TEA.... I think I counted about 7-8 people who ordered coffess.. fraps, macchiatos, etc AFTER me.. and go their drinks BEFORE me... I noticed the barista working made ALL The coffee drinks first and then took a minute to make my tea... which literally took LESS than a minute. to pour make and give to me.. i will NOT be going back to this starbucks again, maybe during a day.... but NEVER in the morning because I was late for work when i got there in plenty of time!

REVIEW #9:  2 stars  (529 chars)
Staff here are great. Thanks, guys.  ...  ... Now we come to the game-changer for me. Recent renovations have resulted in two things happening:  ...  ... 1) A table is now thoroughly unstable. Staff knows but no one has replaced the faulty table. Hot coffee on this table will immediately spill. With Banner next door, this won't be pretty.  ...  ... 2) I can no longer sit in the chairs here for more than an hour. They hurt! ...  ... I'm going to move my [$70/month] coffee business down the road, to a pre-renovation location.

I wish there were more independent coffee shacks around but it seems that for convenience sake, there is always a Starbucks. With that said... I met a friend at Starbucks the other day, it is always pretty nice because of the outdoor patios. This is a stand alone location which makes parking super great. Howie-my new 4-legger needs to continue to work on his socialization skills. So this was a perfect opportunity. Well, lets just say Howie enjoyed the cigarette butts on the ground and chewed gum that the staff does not clean up. Well, I would expect the person who was smoking or chewing gum to dispose of their trash in the bin, but there was NO bin outside. Now that seemed odd to me. Anyway, they should keep a tidy environment. The peppermint latte I had ordered was pretty darn good. There are only 5 tables on the patio and no umbrellas? really? I know it is winter but the sun is so bright it would have been nice. For the size of the place I was surprised that their patio was not larger. All in all an OK adventure.

Went here to fill up our SHINEY new Starbucks tumblers with fresh Christmas drinks! I could not believe how busy it was!! The staff handled the massive amount of people with Speed, accuracy and a smile to boot!! Stephanie did an awesome job navigating my SIX confusing drink orders! A big thank to the Starbucks crew for such a great job under such pressure on Christmas Day !!!!

REVIEW #5:  1 stars  (367 chars)
Has to be the absolute slowest Starbucks I've ever been to... One lady goes back and forth like she can't think of what to do next... They carry on personal conversations instead of focusing on getting drinks out... Watching people standing in line and looking at their faces looks like a bunch of zombies...but what can you do when their isn't another one to go to??

I liked this Starbucks, parking was plenty, there was a good amount of inside seating with outlets for your techno gadgets, and staff was so nice. I'm a green member so I get free refills on coffee and tea, she actually let me change my drink though from tea to coffee on my refills and gave me samples to test which coffee was best :) On the down side the bathrooms were dirty and there seemed to be a wait for coffee.

REVIEW #4:  3 stars  (835 chars)
I am not a huge Starbucks coffee fan (too bitter for my taste) but I can not deny that I thoroughly enjoy a Venti White Chocolate Iced with 2 extra shots and whipped cream on a hot day. ...  ... When I'm feeling especially indulgent I'll spring for the Coffee Frapacino.  The heck with the calories! ...  ... The staff is always warm and friendly with big smiles and a ready welcome.  I get a kick out of listening to the booming barritone voice of the barista.  Don't know his name, but he is young and his voice and personality are that of a much larger guy.  Personality plus. ...  ... Usually fast, usually accurate.  When they make a boo boo on a drink they give it to ya for free.  Can't knock that kind of service. ...  ... I love the whole ambience in these coffee houses even if I'm not "in love" with their "straight" coffee.

REVIEW #5:  3 stars  (73 chars)
It's your average Starbucks. Decent amount of seating inside and outside.

REVIEW #6:  2 stars  (211 chars)
Way too main stream and over-priced. Coffee is not as good as what would be found at a local shop where the employees actually care. Employees were rude and slow, even when there were not many customers waiting.

REVIEW #7:  1 stars  (144 chars)

REVIEW #8:  1 stars  (688 chars)
Was debating between 1 or 2 stars because my breakfast sandwich and coffee were good, but chose just 1. The other bad reviews on this location are right on par with my complaint. My advice is to go to another location completely. The female cashier I encountered was rude.  ...  ... First, I walked in and looked at the pastries and she said hello 3 times like she was trying to rush me and there wasn't even a line behind me. When I asked if they had a particular sandwich available, she said abruptly said yeah and gave me a snotty look. Then, I gave her my credit card and she snatched it out of my hand. Is customer service just not taught or emphasized anymore these days? Guess not.

REVIEW #9:  1 stars  (656 chars)
Wow! Service has gotten worse and worse at this location. Last week I had one person in front of me and 15 minutes later was still waiting for our drinks. So, today I order and a new girl is working the reg. never in my life have I had a barrista mess up my drink and then calls me out in front of the whole line to rering me up for the 60cent difference and then continues tell me I ordered it that way. Not only did she get  size wrong but I guess she didnt hear the skinny part either. Anyways, I wonder if that little girl realizes that 60cent rering just cost them about $150/ month in business. Usually, Starbucks has such good customer service, ugh!

As a former Starbucks manager, I hold Starbucks stores to extemely high standards. I frequent SBUX a lot. By a lot, I mean more than the average Starbucks freak. With that said my input is based on what I know the founder of Starbucks wanted out of each store, and how close the store is to achieving that level of quality service. If any of the points below has an "N/A" next to it, that simply means I was not able to form an opinion based on our interactions. ...  ... 1-Below Standards ... 2-Meets Standards ... 3-Outperforms Standards ...  ...

I personally don't care for Starbucks food and do not believe that is what Starbucks is about. Therefore I do not review their food offerings.

I visited this Starbucks after having my nails done two doors down. I paid cash for my nails. Hang on there is a point to this ;)  I ordered a mocha frapp and gave the girl my debit card which was declined because I hadn't realized that it had expired and I hadn't put the new one in my wallet. Talk about embarrassing!! The girl said "no worries, it's on the house". I was dumb founded. Who does that these days? Thank you! I have yet to stop by and repay them but definitely will do so! Kudos to the girl! Wish I had gotten her name!

REVIEW #3:  5 stars  (423 chars)
Me and my wife come to this place all the time. She needs a lot of coffee, that's why. Anyways, we like to come here and get an black tea for me and an Americano for my wife and then head on over to Petsmart to look at puppies and kitties. Next we go over to Ross and try to score some sweet deals so we look like high fashion. That's basically how every weekend goes and it's all started by this very awesome Starbucks. A+

REVIEW #4:  5 stars  (828 chars)
ooh, yeah, another Starbucks review. So this would be one of three Starbucks locations within a mile radius of my house, but its my favorite! This place has a few tables and chair inside and a little bit more outside on their patio which I love! They have a decent selection of equipment and drinkware to purchase (like I even need more, but I'm a junkie so I'll buy the new design, sigh) and their baked goods are always equally as tempting. The baristas have always been super friendly and welcoming and offer different  drink suggestions when I go "um, I don't know what I want, but I always get a carmel macchiato, but I don't want that today, but I don't know what I want". Drinks are made pretty quickly, even with a line and the bathroom is always clean, so when your espresso diuretic kicks in....you're good. Woot Woot!

REVIEW #5:  4 stars  (574 chars)
Ok I admit it, I have a Starbucks addiction. I'm not proud of it, and it continues to get worse.  I'm a fiend for iced coffee with soymilk, I order them all year long. No fancy latte for me, I don't need the extra calories. ...  ... This Starbucks is rad and it is simply because of the cool employees that work it. I was recently hipped top the Rewards Program, and I have already earned enough points for free customization. No more paying for soy.. It really adds up when you buy 30 a month...   Thanks for the friendly tip that will bring this junkie back over and over.

REVIEW #6:  4 stars  (246 chars)
Screw you and your new hibiscus tea. It's so delicious I now get Starbucks twice a day.  ...  ... If that isn't bad enough you always have yummy little tasters, knowing I have no willpower and you will take even more of my money on my next visit.

REVIEW #7:  4 stars  (245 chars)
This location is a little small but along with seating inside they have tables available outside.  Every time I've ordered it has always been very fast, which I appreciate. The staff is very friendly and my soy latte has been perfect every time!

REVIEW #8:  3 stars  (2064 chars)
Okay, so maybe not really "free" coffee.  I was gifted the January cup, for lack of a better term, which allows one a free cup of coffee every day during the month of January. ...  ... I like coffee.  Starbucks is okay coffee.  The thing I don't like is how they wash my cup every time before they put coffee in it.  I don't like that.  I don't want them washing my cup, I can wash it myself and I don't need you washing it after I wash it.  Besides, maybe I like it dirty.  Maybe you should ask first, but don't ask if you are already washing it, that's just silly. ...  ... Next, they like to run hot water in it to "pre-heat" my cup.  whatever. sniff.  If the coffee gets cold that fast when you pour it in an insulated cup, maybe you should consider serving it at a higher temp.  I promise I won't sue you. ...  ... I always feel kinda weird going into a Starbucks, not that it's a bad place, but maybe I'm just old and cranky and I just want a cup of coffee, I don't need any flavorings or fluffing, just a plain, simple cup of coffee.  I sure don't want to try any of the pastries or foods you have in the display case - I have no clue how long they've been there and if it's more than a couple of hours, then I really don't want it.  I don't want to try your latest coffee rage, or maybe I do, but generally, I just want a cup of coffee.   ...  ... mostly, I can navigate the maze of half-calf, soy latte, americano's and escape with just a cuppa and my sanity.  Some days I get stuck in the crowd of people that think once they order, they can just stand around anywhere, because, really, why would somebody want to put cream in their cuppa before you have your conversation with your long-lost coworker whom you just saw yesterday, so you just stand right in front of the coffee stand where I have to politely wait for you to finish reminiscing and interrupt, so I can get to the cream.   ...  ... Oh, and I'm still amazed that a cup of iced tea, that you fill like 1/3 with tea, then water down with tap water still costs almost $3. ...  ... //rant over.

REVIEW #9:  3 stars  (274 chars)
This location is just ok probably because it is small and yet folks pack into this tiny box of a location. They have offer La Boulange pastries and seem to have a good assortment of salads and sandwiches available throughout the day. I like that this location is open early.

I like this Starbucks since parking (which rarely ever full) is located just 20 feet from the front door. I've been lucky enough to experience their server fail a couple times and walked out with free drinks. If it's not for the large framed, frumpy, unfriendliest dark male Barista who works afternoons, I might give this spot 5 stars. He makes going there unwelcoming.

Man, Starbucks, way to completely butcher my requested pumpkin spice latte.  The pumpkin powder was still floating around the edges of the cup and it tasted awful too.  I've had this drink at many Starbucks and this is the only place that messed it up.  I'm no longer surprised at the low reviews!

REVIEW #5:  1 stars  (543 chars)
Actually run by Aramark, this Starbucks is part of the Taylor Place shops of the downtown campur of ASU. Staffed by students, service is typically friendly, if a bit slow.  ...  ... The real problem is they must be even more lackadaisical about cleaning the place. The coffee fixins station is always covered in crumbs and spills, the refrigerated foods cooler is scantily-stocked, and what's left is withered up and stale, and the bathroom is just downright nasty. ...  ... I shudder to think of the condition of the food and drink prep area.

REVIEW #6:  1 stars  (1679 chars)
Every experience up to today has been mediocre at best.  Today was probably the most annoying.  I've never written a bad review about anywhere before, but today's experience warranted such a review. ... The employees usually seem snobby, or annoyed that they have to help me.  I thought their jobs were to help customers? Maybe I am wrong.   ... On three separate occasions in the past, I have ordered a grande blonde roast, and since it has to slow drip or something, it usually takes a little longer...no big deal....but then they forget about it and I have to go up and ask about its status.  They have been apologetic and I have been given the complimentary drink card on two of those instances, but I'd rather just have my drink and good customer service. ... Today, the girl at the register, Shayla, stood there talking to the other girls behind the counter about their weekend, laughing and hanging out, while I was standing there waiting.  There were three people behind me waiting as well.  Shayla finally decided it was time to help me, but still not even paying attention she took my order and gave me my total before I was done ordering.  Very frustrating, horrible customer service.  All of the other employees were just standing there as well, so its not as if no one saw me standing there.  They all just seemed distracted, or more interested in talking to each other than helping anyone.  I was very close to walking out, but she finally asked me what I wanted just in time. ... Starbucks, or whoever owns this location needs to hire some employees who have an idea of how to provide even semi-good customer service.  I will not be visiting this location anymore.

REVIEW #7:  1 stars  (248 chars)
This is the worst Starbucks of all time. Drinks are always bad -- or completely wrong. Slow service. Disgusting bathrooms. Annoying baristas.  ...  ... I only go here if I'm desperate for caffeine, in a rush, and don't have time to walk to Royal...

REVIEW #8:  1 stars  (638 chars)
Worst coffee drink I have ever had and it only cost my $4.65. ...  ... I absolutely hate giving one star reviews, but this place needs to figure out how to make their signature coffee drinks instead of handing out a cup of milk with ice. The service was friendly, but the entire time I was there I couldn't help but feel a little out of place due to all the freshman year ASU students sporting their Victoria's Secret PINK gear. The line was long, but they were staffed appropriately so the wait time was minimal. ...  ... I knew I should have gone to Cartel, I need to stick to my gut! ...  ... One star for friendly, inadequate service.

Whenever I venture to this Starbucks I always find a ton of people just hanging out reading or playing on their computer.

Nearest Starbucks by me, me and my boyfriend visit all the time. Its a great Starbucks to attend but depending on the Barista, some tend to pound those up-charges on your drink. I recommend it, its a great location!

REVIEW #7:  4 stars  (1817 chars)
This is just my first stop to this Starbucks, but I'm impressed with the versatility yet non-complicated design and execution of the way this Starbucks operates. While I find the entrance a little too tight (when you open the door you have 2, maybe 3 meters before the ordering counter), I find the overall horizontal design of the cafe compensates for this entrance flaw. More importantly, the variety of chairs, couches, and sofa chairs gives options to the patrons here, along with a moderate amount of power jacks for those running electronic devices that need a constant power draw. ...  ... The baristas here are very friendly and will be chatty with you, providing valuable insight of the surrounding area, areas of interest depending on what you are looking for. ...  ... The clientele here is varied, if you are a people person like me. I have seen elderly couples here already at 7 PM, but I also have seen students of various edges step in and out for a quick coffee, from the nearby dance studio next door. ...  ... I've seen middle aged couples come in, along with people of my age group (23-29) pop in to just grab a cup of fancy Starbucks joe and sit down to study or read off a Kindle. ...  ... All in all, I think this place definitely gets the job done, and the Google powered wifi here gives this place a major plus that most Starbucks do not have. (Seriously, AT&T wifi is crap, it can barely support ten users at a time, Google hotspots are FAR more powerful). ...  ... I may or may not come here in the future. I think there are other Starbucks I want to venture to first. The baristas here mentioned that there are Starbucks in Tempe that open far later in the night and would offer the kind of people I would probably get along with. Who knows, I am still new to this strange and busy city! :)

Forewarning: I am not a Starbucks frequenter. Nor a coffee snob. ...  ... I stopped at this Starbucks on Christmas Day. I realize that virtually no one wants to work on Christmas and it was nice that it was open! Ok, now that the positive stuff is out of the way... ...  ... I don't fully understand the Starbucks jargon. So I struggled through ordering a medium blended vanilla coffee drink with skim milk & no whipped cream. The woman taking orders was extremely snobby and stuck up through the whole thing. I thought she was going to tell me to "get out" when I ordered a medium instead of a "grande". Whatever lady. ...  ... I had 3 people in line in front of me and about 5 people behind me. It took, no lie, EIGHT minutes for my drink!!! For real?! The barista could not have been slower & offered no personality, conversation or pleasantness. The employees were just chatting amongst each other while, at this point 7 people are waiting for drinks & only the snail barista is poking along with the drinks while the other 2 watched. ...  ... Also, man a few people behind me wanted coffee ground. Apparently, "Sir, there are TWELVE ways we ground our coffee. I'm gonna need you to be more specific". Again, in stuck up mode. Oh get over yourself lady.

Ok, it's a freaking Starbucks, what do you expect - well, I expect overpriced but consistent coffee and the barrista to NOT BE AN EVIL BI-OTCH. The least they can do when charging $4 for a cup of coffee is attempt to be friendly. I used to go to this one several times a week but NO MORE. I'm done. How many times can you stand at the counter and be totally ignored while the employees chat behind the pastry case? Almost always, apparently. Went there 2 weekends ago with my kids and ordered a sweetened iced coffee, like always. After getting an incredulous look from the woman behind the counter - an older woman wearing a headscarf, in case her manager is reading this  - like I was crazy or something, like no one had EvER asked for an iced coffee before, she asked me how I wanted it sweetened. I said, nicely, just the way you always do it, with syrup or whatever. She LITERALLY rolled her eyes at me and said, so like you want sugar, or vanilla syrup, or what? I said no, no flavor, just the syrup sweetener you guys normally use. She says, so do you want a vanilla latte then or what? and just stands there looking at me like I'm NUTS. So I said forget it, I'll sweeten it myself. After slamming my credit card down in front of me, like I'd personally insulted her mother or something, she hands me a sloppy lukewarm cup of coffee half full of melted ice. Nice!!!! If it had only happened once, no big deal. everyone has a bad day now and then - but it's a pattern with this Starbucks. Too bad.

I visited this location twice. The first time was awesome! We went through the drive-thru and the woman at the window was super nice and friendly. She went above and beyond! She was like a hawaiian or samoan descent. She was awesome!! Drinks came out perfect! No complaints. The next day however we came across a caucasian brunette female. She messed up our order, overcharged us and then we proceeded to inform her NICELY, then she copped major attitude. She 'literally' rolled her eyes. Who the hell does that???? lol. She made it such a hassle that we just said forget it, not even worth it.

i'm never gonna get my head around my fellow AMERICAN's obsession with STARBUCKS. i have friends that are late every month on their VISA and MASTERCARD accounts (which are probably mostly STARBUCKS charges anyway) because they have a forty-plus-dollar a week coffee habit. ...  ... still, when you're on the road, it's nice to have a place where you can drop by and jolt the senses into a heightened state of alertness and use their WI-FI to get caught up on your e-mail.

This Is Actually the Starbucks Store I like the Least That I have been to in the Phx Area.... Every Time I have gone Whether Early In the Morning(not too early actually, around 6-7am) or At Night (About half an hour before they Close) They Take The Longest Time........... And ALSO Manage to Get My Drink Or My Companions' Drink Wrong..... Once we had to correct the barista taking our order Several Times... And She Still Got It Wrong... I know they might be busy or distracted but It's A Part Of Their Job To Get It Right....  The Manager Really needs To Think It Through A Lot More when hiring Young Teenagers... The Baristas that have taken my orders could try harder to improve their customer service skills As Well... Anyways... I Love Starbucks!!!

Waited over 25 min in the drive thru because I had no choice (blocked in) after the cashier took an order from a guy on foot... Boo this place. Disgrace to the Starbucks chain.

REVIEW #13:  1 stars  (578 chars)
Worst Starbucks I've ever been too. I went there in the evening and they had plenty of staff, but they seemed too busy talking to each other and complaining about the only person working, to pay attention to customers. They wanted to cut her early so someone could take an extra 15 minute lunch. That doesn't make sense. I'm sure that poor girl could hear them talking about her because I could hear them in the lobby. The woman next to me said, "I can't believe them." Then walked out. If I wasn't already meeting someone there, I would have too. Never again to that Starbucks!

REVIEW #14:  1 stars  (200 chars)
You would think that being the first person in line at 5:45am would help you get great service. Well at this location that is not the case. It amazes me how some locations don't value their customers.

This is MY starbucks....I go almost every single day. These are the reasons.  ...  ... 1) On my way to work ... 2) Right next to my bank ... 3) They are SO friendly ... 4) They understand when I'm off coffee and order "black water" that I mean a coffee of the day, black.  ... 5) The sweet girl in the drivethrough that is there almost every day I go always acts like it is her fault when I spill an entire venti hot coffee in my car. Even though I have an insurance policy on my car upholstery for a reason.....and it's not bad lids...it's that I should live in a bubble so as not to injure others! ...  ... Love My Starbucks!

It's hard to find a place where people are happy amd cheerful at 430am on a friday morning lol. Well you can tell that the Starbucks staff at this location are trying their best to help everyone get their morning started off on the right foot. Im never happy waking up early, let alone having to work befor 6am so my hats off to them. This Starbucks is located very close to my house and the fact they have free-wifi gives me a nice place to enjoy a morning coffee while checking morning emails or just browsing the web. The coffee drinks are a little pricey but they generally are of high quality so its worth the little bit of extra money.

REVIEW #7:  3 stars  (320 chars)
My drink always taste great, however that is what you are paying for consistency and price!  ...  ... Convenient to have a drive through, but never is it quick. If they could work on the time it took to be and in and out with your drink they'd probably receive better reviews. ...  ... Ill re review if anything changes!

REVIEW #8:  3 stars  (229 chars)
The service is mediocre here. The drive thru is a very convenient but sometimes slow. They tend to be slower than most other stores and this store can get crowded really quick. I use this store because of the convenient location.

REVIEW #9:  3 stars  (733 chars)
This location is right next to my house,  ... I ALWAYS stop here in the mornings to get my coffee, yet refuse to go through the god-awful drive through. The average time from start to finish is like 12 minutes. I  dont order anything fancy, so why should I wait for other people to get their fancy drink order? I just want my black venti coffee and be on my way. So walking in is the only way to go. Ordering a breakfast sandwich will add 10 minutes to your wait time, dont do it.  ... Its a fun place to study, very interesting conversations going on around you. They also have a lot of outlets so you can charge your laptop, phone, etc.  ... The guy who works the counter in the mornings is really sweet.  ... Egh, its a starbucks.

REVIEW #10:  2 stars  (469 chars)
Let me start by saying I love Starbucks. Seating inside is a bit haphazard and very few comfortable chairs.  ...  ... Today, their espresso machines were out of order and a hand written sign was on the door to let you know as you entered. Now anchor machine falling out of service may not be preventable, but both machines, including the one for the drive thru? ...  ... Were out of large straws as well which suck for those of us who order venti or Trenta size drinks.

REVIEW #11:  2 stars  (832 chars)
Not a fan of this location.  Try the one on 3rd ave & south side of bell. ...  ... Wow, someone actually managed to ruin a Starbucks location!!  Slow drive through, condescending service, and overall lack of interest on the part of the employees.  ...  ... We stopped in on my hunny's birthday on our way to vegas. This is the location closest to us so we wanted to just get in and out.  The voice on the drive through was kinda short with us, but I get it- you're busy.  We finally get to the window after over 10 minutes waiting.  The guy does not give us our gift card back.  I go inside and they can't find it. My hunny goes inside, and at least gets them to look for it and reprint the receipt.  Starbucks corporate reissued the card for us a few days later so in ended up fine.   ...  ... Still, this location has no urgency!!

REVIEW #12:  2 stars  (383 chars)
This has to be the SLOWEST Starbucks I have ever been to. I don't understand it. It doesn't matter the time of day/week -- its slow. If you don't have a good 20 minutes to wait, go elsewhere. And people if you have over 2-3 drinks to order DON'T use the drive thru! That's just common sense, right?! We got stuck behind someone that ordered 7 drinks! Not kidding... 7! Who does that?

REVIEW #13:  2 stars  (748 chars)
This used to be one of my favorite spots but lately it's been dirty almost every time I visit. Having been a barista, I know you can get slammed and get behind on the housekeeping but I have witnessed several times that employees seem oblivious to the mess on the floor, under tables, on chairs and around the condiment bar.  ...  ... The staff is always friendly and I still like to go but it's weird to sit and enjoy my java while looking at all the debris on the floor. I also inquired of one barista regarding what kind of milk they used, specifically asking about rgbh or rbst. She said they just buy the run-of-the-mill milk like the kind at Safeway etc. I will stick with the java & espresso - don't want no hormones or steroids in my latte!

REVIEW #14:  1 stars  (483 chars)
If I could give them 0 stars I would. There's one nice younger boy who works occasionally. Other than him the staff is full of the rudest set of sorority rejects Starbucks could get. It's obvious they none of them want to be there and their sense of urgency is non existent. Don't go here if your in a rush to work! I avoid this Starbucks and just go to the coffee bean a few minutes out of the way. The few minutes out of the way is still better than waiting 15 minutes for a drink.

REVIEW #15:  1 stars  (1040 chars)
Ok. First things first, this is the location near my friends apartment and I go to Starbucks almost everyday. I walk in to the lobby the first day and I ordered a breakfast sandwich(and somehow they gave me a lemon loaf cake which they were annoyed to exchange even though I had my receipt in hand), and I also ordered a iced white mocha. The girl on the register was obviously new and confused and it took her a really long time to get everything in the system and the manager on duty was obviously annoyed with her asking for help. The second time I went to this location I used the drive thru thinking it would be better, my friend got a black coffee and I got an iced coffee figuring this order was a lot harder to mess up....WRONG. My iced coffee didn't have WM sweetener like I asked it had classic syrup and cream instead. And to make matters worse... I am an employee of Starbucks. I gave the girl my employee numbers and she said "wow you are a dinosaur" UMM THANKS?! It has the potential to be a good location but far from it now.

REVIEW #16:  1 stars  (710 chars)
This is honestly the worst Starbucks experience that I've ever encountered.  That being said, I go here almost everyday because it's right by where I live.  Although, I'm starting to go up to the Happy Valley location more now.  For some reason, this Starbucks drive thru is frighteningly slow.  Almost upsetting slow.  I have tried to figure it out but I can't.  A couple times last week whoever takes the orders was trying to be funny and wouldn't just take my order and it was terribly unprofessional and annoying.  Every time I get my coffee drink I swear I won't be back...but I do.  They really need to up their customer service and speed it up a bit.  It's a prime location if they can pull it together.

Love this Starbucks because of the booths. ... I do homework here, and reallllly dislike it when all I have to choose from are two cushioned chairs (that are always being taken up by the old guys with their newspapers-- no offense, I know they go their first and fair is fair) and a bunch of hardwood chairs... what can I say, I like a little cushion on my butt.  Can you blame me? ...  ... no. no is the answer to blaming me. ...  ...  ... anyway, their drinks are all right, the baristas are friendly (some a strange, but overall a friendly bunch) ...  ... I used to work at Starbucks eons ago so I'm really picky and I like this one. ... so patron it. ...  ...  ... holler.

REVIEW #2:  4 stars  (917 chars)
Since quitting smoking my coffee intake dropped off for several years, due to the powerful association between the two.  ...  ... It's only recently that I've felt like I could enjoy a cuppa Joe without wanting to suck on a lung rocket. Enter Starbucks, the only conveniently located coffee shop on my way to work.  ...  ... Starbucks are pretty much all the same when it comes to delivering decent, consistent coffee. This location is no exception.  ...  ... What really impressed me was the excellent customer service. On my very first visit I ordered my drink then immediately realized that I had left my wallet at home. The cashier didn't even blink, he just told me not to worry about it, they'd cover it. For a regular customer this would be great service, but for a first time visitor? Good stuff.  ...  ... While not an every day thing, I will definitely be stopping in once or twice a week. Thanks Starbucks!

REVIEW #3:  3 stars  (395 chars)
Normally not too busy but the staff is less than friendly and not very quick to get you in and out.  I wanted to blonde roast the other day and the cashier said "um, we are out and I'd have to make another batch of it."  Had he of asked me if I wanted to wait I would have said yes but he didnt even offer!  Normally I have pretty good luck with service at Starbucks but this one is hit or miss!

REVIEW #5:  3 stars  (1334 chars)
Ok, so I'm sitting here now at this starbucks doing a job search.  I've been here several times before, on and off over the past few months.  This starbucks isn't so bad, but here's what I've noticed since coming here. ...  ... The staff is always friendly and helpful.  I like that about this place, and they really know their stuff.  The place is a long narrow suite, so seating is kind of tight, but ample.  Not a lot of room to spread out, but decent enough that you can at least move around a bit. ...  ... One of the downsides is that if your here to use the wifi, its free! (hooray!) the downside?  Good luck getting a plug! There's only two plugs available for devices at either end of the store.  If your stuck in the middle, I hope your battery has a long life! Plus, a few times that I have been here, There have been plug hogs who use all the outlets! Yes, theres only two, but who's the butthead who needs to charge their phone AND computer at a starbucks?  If your going to be here a while, I hope your battery life is good! ...  ... They do have outside seating with umbrellas, but their not always open.  Parking is ample, and its not half bad.  Great hours, etc.  Swing by if you have a chance, and you can get your coffee and wifi on like me!  Definitely not the greatest Starbucks in town, but not the worst either.

REVIEW #6:  3 stars  (825 chars)
Ordered a grande latte and asked with no flavor (can't have sugar or anything), almond milk (no flavor at this location), so got it with soy milk instead.  After I tasted it, I can taste the syrup flavor in the coffee, I asked for no flavor because I know they would put something like syrup in it and they screwed something this easy.  Starbucks need to retrain their baristas to make sure they can listen better.  I went around lunch time but the store wasn't all that busy at all.  They need to pay more attention on what the customers need and not just about how much money they can get from it.  I never had any problems asking what I want at other locations, not sure why this is a problem.  I'll probably give them another try if the management would reply this message back to me to see how we can resolve this issue.

REVIEW #7:  1 stars  (338 chars)
This Starbucks is okay.  I only come here because its the only one on my way to work.  Their staff can be rude and unfriendly, they make you feel like you're not as important as the other customers are their friends are they know.  I think I'm going to have to find another Starbucks even if that means I have to go out of my way....  ::(

Thank god for Starbucks at 5:30am.  =) ...  ... I was on my way into work and was in dire need of a wake me up and some breakfast.  I stopped in hoping on a Saturday Starbucks was open and sure enough I was saved.   ...  ... I got a Venti Caramel Macchiato and a piece of coffee cake.  Both items were exactly what I needed to get me going this morning and keep me awake through my workday.   ...  ... Starbucks you saved me once again.

This Starbucks is located inside the Safeway on 19th Ave. They made my order correctly and it was the late afternoon pick me up I needed. No complaints as you know exactly what you're going to get when you go to a Starbucks.

REVIEW #3:  2 stars  (632 chars)
Starbucks was having a happy hour promotion for about 10 days recently, where between 3-5PM you could get half price frappucinos.  I (or my wife) went four times over the promotion.  75% of the time our order was screwed up in some way, shape or form (whip when no whip was requested, caramel flavor when should have been coffee, venti when it should have been grande, etc.).  The drinks still tasted good, but dag, that is a pretty poor success rate.  Service was (and usually) is pretty friendly at least.   ...  ... Now the question...if I want a caramel/coffee ice blended drink...who am I going to choose, McD's or Starbucks...

Drive-thru is rather quick at 5:30am in the morning and the barista was quite cheery for such an early hour -- completely different experience that the inside for a past few visits.

love coffee, recently started drinking it so i go here a lot. close by my house whcih is a big plus since its the only drive through starbucks close by me. i only gave it 4 stars because of the huge lines it gets. and when there is a long line the employees always take forever to make drinks. i went here at around 3 today and there was about 4 or 5 cars in front of me and the employees were slow and rushed me right when i got my drink from the drive through.

REVIEW #7:  4 stars  (978 chars)
Most Starbuck are pretty much the same. All have the same menu for the most part. The difference between them rely on the location on the way the seating is set up. ...  ... Pros: Big parking lot, good use of space available without feeling crammed, 3 lounge chairs with counter for drinks. Unlimited use of wifi, right off the 101, outside seating ...  ... Cons: Expensive lunch ( if you plan on grabbing food, do it before), only two decent size table for workspace, Hard to see the location off Tatum ( this is probably more cuz of city/ complex rules with marking the building with a sign). The parking is hard to find. I got lucky finding the only spot right up front.  ...  ... Overall: All Starbucks are pretty much the same, this location is conveniently off the freeway, however lack of multi use tables for laptop work is a slight bummer. So I give it a four stars. They did however have great customer service. They did a pour-over for my favorite blend Blonde Roast.

By far the slowest Starbucks I have been to. I have been here many times and i am always amazed at how long it takes to get in and out.  I live right up the street so hard to avoid but I definitely make a point to go to other locations if I am driving by one.  Just now, there was one person in front of me ordering a breakfast sandwich. From the time I walked in the door, it took 11 minutes to get an iced coffee in my hand.   ...  ... I like Starbucks because I know what I am getting, but really dont enjoy going to this one in particular.

REVIEW #11:  3 stars  (290 chars)
Decent coffee consistently, but suuuuper busy a lot of the time which means long waits. Actually, with just a few cars, the drive through is sometimes still very slow. I've also gotten the wrong drink on a driving order. A cappuccino is not a macchiato. Cinnamon dolce isn't white mocha. :/

REVIEW #12:  3 stars  (898 chars)
It's a Starbucks: they burn the coffee beans and use really artificial flavors but I'm addicted and so are you so we all grumble and pretend to be coffee aficionados while take the mediocre drinks on our daily commutes. ...  ... They never mess up my drink here but the wait is horrendous. Like, expect to wait 10 minutes for your drink when you're the only one in the drive-thru. If there are people in front of you you'd better have a lot of extra time or hope  you don't care if you're late.  ...  ... Another annoyance is the design of the drive-thru window with the curb. It's set like 3 feet back so when you pull up to pay/get your coffee you have to reeaaalllly reach out your window and even then you barely grasp the barista's hand to exchange money and get your beverage(s).  ...  ... I go here everyday because it's the only drive-thru right by my house. But I complain every time I do.

REVIEW #13:  3 stars  (333 chars)
Just a suggestion, but smile people!  ...  ... Really, it makes the customer service experience better and not make people feel like spawn coming in for coffee. ...  ...

REVIEW #14:  3 stars  (1092 chars)
This was our first time to this particular location and as the other reviews state - it was slammed both inside and in the drive-thru.  Took about ten minutes to get through the line, with about six people in front of me and about eight workers behind the counter.  ...  ... They also don't seem to have any storage in their back room, since they had well over 20 merchandise boxes sitting around the the store and unopened.  They also had a large pastry metal cart with single wrapped pastries sitting on them.   ...  ... The poor staff looked highly stressed and the cashier wasn't overly friendly, but wasn't rude or mean either.  ...  ... My drink order was correct and tasted just like it should though, and let's be honest - at the end of the day, isn't that all that you really want from your coffee? ...  ... Overall: B ... It's a busy location with staff under pressure to get through lines and lots of seasonal merchandise to put on display. It wasn't an exceptional experience, but it wasn't bad either!  Still the good coffee I was expecting to get - so all is right in the world.

REVIEW #15:  3 stars  (579 chars)
Very busy location, even the drive thru always has a line!   ...  ... This Starbucks is probably not the best location to go to if you are in a big hurry.  Its hard to find a close parking spot.  Its also more difficult to get in and out of this particular stripmall because Tatum is usually packed.  Go to the light if you need to turn left! ...  ... The baristas have always been pleasant to deal with here.  One even took the time to look up the ingredients a a smoothie for me, so very accommodating.  I will say their bathrooms at this one seem to always appear dirty, yuck!

Meh, I've experienced much better... ...  ... We used to frequent this Star Bucks a lot until Press Coffee opened near by.  We wanted to top off a great evening with a nice cup of Joe and Press Coffee was closed at 7pm and it was 7:30pm, oh no.... so we stopped by Star Bucks. ...  ... The service started off as a standard Star Bucks, quick to greet, though missing the smile this time, and ready to make what ever caffeinated concoction your craving for. ...  ... Coffee #1 ~ decaf and sugar free vanilla syrup. Barista stated, "we are out to decaf, would regular coffee be ok?" What??  No, we would like a decaf please.  Barista, "that will take 10 mins, so you will need to wait".  We asked, why are you out of decaf? Barista, "we stop making decaf earlier in the day". We did not want to wait so we opted for a leaded brew. ...  ... Coffee #2 ~ regular coffee with sugar free caramel.  I watched the Barista and noticed she used the white pump for the sugar free vanilla and the brown pump for the sugar free caramel. Star Bucks used one collar for sugar free and the other for sugared syrups.  As she poured our coffee I asked her to please make sure she gave us sugar free and not sugar. I noticed you used both colored pumps.  Barista, snippy ~ "we don't separate our flavorings like the other Star Bucks". She then dumped our coffee's out and using the same cups proceeded to use the same pumps again...   ...  ... So we got both coffee's and proceeded to the cream bar and there was no cream...  So I asked a different barista for some cream.  She stated, "here ya go" and placed a gallon carton of cream on the bar and walked off. ...  ... Wowsers!  The coffee tasted burned as though it had been sitting there a while and we were for sure if we were drinking sugar free.  No sugar comma later so we are ok and don't plan to go back to this Star Bucks for a while...

I could tell it would just be the same. No thanks and I will not be back!

Okay I'm not just saying this... And keep in mind I have never been inside this location... ...  ... But, I've been a huge coffee-snob my entire life almost so my taste buds are like super high maintenance when it comes to a good pull of espresso.  This Starbucks in particular is hands down, the best I have been to in the valley.  I work right down the road and I honestly hate going to any other Starbucks on my side of town (Not Phoenix).  The drive-thru is super fast and every single person on the morning crew is just phenomenal.  They are SO friendly and not once have they gotten my order wrong.  I'm not even going to lie, my drink is not a "normal" request.  And they get it dead on every single time.  I have not been to one other Starbucks across the valley that has gotten my order correct.   ...  ... I'm sure you guys can relate with me, but there is nothing worse than your first morning coffee being wrong (right? extra grumpy-here I come!).  BUT!  I do not have to worry about that here. It's amazing. ...  ...  I wish they knew how much I appreciate knowing that I can just go there, order my high maintenance coffee drink and know that its going to be just what I ordered.  I love it.

Seing as how I work right down the road from this location, I have become a frequent mid day visitor of this Starbucks.  The drive through is always moving and they are consistent with every return trip.  I had to wait for a few minutes, no more than 10, and when I got to the front of the line, they comped my entire order of four drinks, nice touch.  I always see them moving people in and out with efficiency, so they get a four star review from me. At this point, you either have gotten used to the burnt taste of Starbucks or not, but complaining about, this late in the game, is annoying.

This is a really good Starbucks location. Unlike a lot of the newer locations that have retro plastic chairs that look much more stylish than functional, it has lots of comfy upholstered chairs, plenty of plugs for web surfers, and a decently-sized outdoor seating area. The staff is really friendly and efficient as well. There is also a drive-through.

I don't go as much as I used to when I thought I had less time.  but I do go often enough to read or just pick up a coffee and I've seen a great improvement in this store.  That's great. ...  ... 2011 Review ... I'm giving them a 3 because I rarely get exactly what I want from the window. But let me start with the good first.  Friendliest bunch of folks I've ever seen.  All people on the staff seem to love their jobs!  They also seem to work very efficiently.    ...  ... Unfortunately, the attire is a little small.  Ites not conducive to a small study group, even though it practically sits on a small college campus..  No couches or comfy chairs to sit and socialize. ...  ... My main reason for the 3 rating is the fact that I rarely get what I "want" from that drive up window!  I used to order a tall coffee and a HOT veggie sandwich.  The sandwich is almost always cold in the center, even if I ask them to heat it longer so the center is warm.  Sometimes I ask for my coffee with two pumps of cream and I have to go in to get more cream.  I have stopped ordering the sandwiches as much, saves me money, that's for sure.   ...  ... I started making my own coffee at home, and soon, I'll probably just stop by there as a treat once a week for the coffee, sans the sandwhich.

I periodically go through the drive-thru of this location on my way to work, and though there are always  many cars, they are pretty speedy and very friendly. At this particular location I am happy to leave tip.

REVIEW #10:  3 stars  (340 chars)
I want to like this Starbucks I really do, but they make it so difficult. I'm writing this review from the drive-thru which is where I have been for the past 13 minutes. The service here is super slow and there's a 50% chance they'll give me the wrong drink. I have to check it each time before pulling off. They need some serious training.

REVIEW #11:  3 stars  (226 chars)
Typical Starbucks. Usually very busy (nowhere to sit on weekends), and is not a big store at all. Since it is smaller, the selection of coffee mugs and other paraphernalia that they sell is not very big. Staff is nice, though!

REVIEW #12:  2 stars  (1052 chars)
I rarely go to this super close to home Starbucks because of how slow their service is- not to mention their mediocre customer service. I'm running late this morning as it is and decide to stop for a passion tea (since I'm late already anyway) I get there & opt out of going through drive thru because the line is ridiculously long, so instead I get out and walk inside. When I get in, there are TWO customers ahead of me the lady ordering is ordering at least 10 drinks and the cashier looked extremely irritated. So me and the guy in front of me are waiting a total 10 minutes before they decide to get another cashier to help us along with the other 6 people that walked in after us. Anyways paid for my drink and waited for my drink- the barista who gave me my drink didn't look at all happy to be working. I asked her for water with ice along with my tea, she let out a huge sigh and asked another barista to give me my water... I was reminded EXACTLY why I do not ever go to this Starbucks - this is by far my least favorite Starbucks thus far...

Just dropped in ~3:30PM today for a coffee drink and newspaper.  The counter was dirty and sticky--obviously not clean.  I started to put my paper down so it could ring up and ... changed my mind. The girl ringing me up did it anyway, and it now has a sticky blotch on the back.  I asked her not to--she just looked at me (huh?).  So I mentioned that this counter--the one where customers put their drinks and pay--needed cleaned.  she just looked at me --and said "okay".  But she did not clean it, she went around to the salad food customer facing display case and checked that out.  When I picked up my drink on the other end, that counter was equally --not clean--sticky with rings and dried (kind of) spills.  3 people were working and it was not busy.  There is no excuse to have this place be dirty.  I didn't check the tables since I was taking it to go, but I bet they were dirty too.  These people need some house cleaning lessons--this is no way to leave counters and it takes just a minute.  It did not get done when I was there, and that girl or anyone else did not care.  She was maybe 5'6 with long curly dark hair tied back, maybe in early 20s, and maybe 20 # extra weight, and she had on camel-beige-colored pants.  I hope the food inspectors come in when it looks like this.  Some people who work here must have mothers at home cleaning up after them.  Obviously the manager is not on duty.

REVIEW #14:  2 stars  (1122 chars)
Not really a fan of this Sbux. Just sayin. I feel coffee should not be a hard thing nor should it take me so long to get . However, it's right down the way from my boyfriends and thus, convenient. Let's face it, when you need java, it's needed now. NOT in 15 minutes from ordering. Two things recently, on my way to my campus, very early in the morning, I ordered a quad nonfat dry Cappuccino. Doesn't seem that difficult, right. I start to walk out and realize it's a sugary, mocha sort of thing. Spat!! Ewww. No. I don't like chocolate that much and I hate sugar more. This drink I waited on for 10 minutes; my bf had his Americano and was having to leave me or he was gonna be late for a meeting ! She almost sneered at me when I told her the coffee was not what I ordered. Oh well. 5 more minutes and correct Capp. In hand ; wow maybe the baristas need more java?? Secondly, I splurged on a quad nonfat caramel latte and it's coming out to me as a frap? Hmmmm. What? Did I say 'cold'? Why no I did not.. More attitude. So there is my justification for 2 stars ... You see in this side of town... There's just no Peets!

REVIEW #15:  1 stars  (405 chars)
The slowest drive thru ever. In the time I've been in line (only 3 cars in front of me, which is why I thought it might be worth it this time) I've downloaded the yelp app, created a profile, and posted this review. This is the third time I've tried this drive thru and it will be the last. I've never been in line for less than 15 minutes. Before I even ordered the two cars behind me backed up to leave.

REVIEW #16:  1 stars  (726 chars)
This is the worst Starbucks I've been to. I've lived across the street for 10 years, so naturally we adopted this as our go to coffee shop. ...  ... I've tried giving them the benefit of the doubt bit after today's drink, I'm done. The employees are nice, but incredibly slow. The drinks are always watered down, and never flavored enough.  ...  ... I just ordered a Carmel Frap. It came thin and melted, with hardly any Carmel flavoring. It's white in coloring. This is the last blunder I'm allowing. It's ridiculous that they think Starbucks (the king of coffee shops) would be okay with these products being served. If I could return my drink, and give them no stars, I would.  ...  ... I'll be going elsewhere from now on.

Out of over 30 times I have been to this location ordering the same drink, they have only messed up once - and it doesn't help that I am one of those people that order weird stuff to my drink.  ...  ... Now that everyone there knows me, we're good. If you are on of "those" people like myself, you may need to walk them through it the first time. ...  ... Super clean store and employees that actually DO care. I'll take my business to that any day.

REVIEW #5:  5 stars  (555 chars)
Walked here using the camelback underpass Saturday morning and we just beat the crowd. Five other people followed us in. There is lots of work space here and a large table that could easily hold a business meeting. The coffee was the usual Starbucks high standard and exquisite flavor. The barista was very efficient and the whole experience was marvelous. (And the bathrooms were spotless.) Lots of outdoor seating, which would be nice at a different time of year. Only four big comfortable chairs, so guessing this Starbucks caters to the working crowd.

REVIEW #6:  5 stars  (759 chars)
While I totally agree with a lot of Yelp-ers who feel reviewing Starbucks is like reviewing water (it's plentiful, we need it to live, etc.), this location really deserves some recognition due to its wonderful staff. I work in the Esplanade and generally, this place is a culinary wasteland. But, at this Starbucks, the staff is truly special. Yes, they serve the same beverages as every other Starbucks, but the people who work here know my name, say hello and ask me how my day is and even start my drink before I have to ask. It is nice to be able to run down, grab a latte and share a friendly moment. I have frequented other Starbucks and other coffee places for years without getting this sort of assistance. So, Five Stars for the super-friendly staff.

I am used to NYC StarBucks, however a Starbucks is still a Starbucks.  They didn't know a lot of lingo and how to make specialty drinks which are trivial in the NYC area.  This one had a drive-thru window which was also something I am not used to.  All and all very good coffee and I am a fan.

REVIEW #4:  3 stars  (661 chars)
This Starbucks is weird. Drive through and walk-up only. Only outdoor seating. Weird can be good! But, it wasn't great.  ...  ... It's essentially in the parking lot of a hotel, and I visited while I was staying in that hotel. They had the same ratio as my local Starbucks... my drink was right 3 out 4 times. However, the one time it WAS wrong - it wasn't just a LITTLE wrong - it was completely the wrong drink. ...  ... Definitely not somewhere you'd go to do work in less-than-perfect weather, and it might as well be located ON the highway... i.e. there is a ton of road noise.   ...  ... However... friendly staff.  ...  ... Standard Starbucks experience.

REVIEW #5:  2 stars  (1061 chars)
This is an outdoor seating only Starbucks. There is a walk-up window for drinks, but no visable snacks. There is also a drive thru window for cars. There are 4 small round tables with 2-3 chairs a peice, and 1 larger rectangular table for disabled access with 2-3 chairs also. Prices are normal for a starbucks. Pros: Outdoors in late fall and early spring will be nice here, and it definately can't get crowded here. Cons: Only 2 umbrellas outside keep you shady from the sun or dry from the rain, there doesn't appear to be snacks here. No indoor seating, Midsummer here is going to be bad, also Semi-trucks are constantly shifting on the freeway here so it is very noisy, and there are no power outlets. There are several other open wifi spots here like the days inn and dennys, so you might be better suited to moving to one of those locations, but if you must sit here, then the att&t free wifi hotspot speed is 1.4 Mbit download speed, and 1.2 Mbit upload speed. (divide Mbit by 8 to get actual MB speeds). Overall I give this spot a 2 thumbs up out of 5.

REVIEW #6:  1 stars  (348 chars)
I'm a big Starbucks drinker so I was super excited when I found out how close this one was to us! However, to my disappointment this has been the only Starbucks that does not hold up to par. Every time I have gone my drink has been messed up. Even simple drinks such as a hot green tea. So sadly to say we won't be going to this Starbucks any more.

At first I was disappointed that they moved from Pinnacle Peak because that location was across the street from my house. However, their new store on Happy Valley is so much nicer.  ... Great staff & excellent drive thru service! ... The people that complain about the slow drive thru are probably the same people ordering all their "special" drinks that aren't even on the menu.

I am a Canadian and was in Phoenix for the winter. I ended up walking up to this Starbucks most mornings for a Latte, and very soon was welcomed by name by the staff in the store. They were all positive, wonderful, friendly people. When they were busy they always apologized for the wait. I am back in Canada now and miss my Starbucks visit each day. I am looking forward to coming back to Phoenix next winter and will definately have this store on my schedule when I return. The coffee is much the same in all the Starbucks I have been in. What makes this a great store is the fantastic staff!

We all know that there so many variables that can go wrong during the morning preparation for work, all of which have the potential of starting the day off on a negative note in some cases these things can change the course of the whole day. This morning my experience at this Starbucks was just the opposite.. The drive through line was short and the team was not only friendly, but extremely knowledgeable. ... As a former Starbucks employee I can say this team is rare! Consistency is key to me and they've got it all!! I pass by two other Starbucks locations each day to this store because I know they will help me start my day off right every time!

REVIEW #13:  4 stars  (472 chars)
Food quality and taste aside due to it being a chain restaurant the thing that sets apart Starbucks from each other are the people behind the bar. This location has some great, friendly people who tend to make a consistent drink.  ...  ... Like other reviewers have mentioned, this location can get slammed (especially around 9AM) but it is a function of high demand as opposed to incompetent or slow baristas. ...  ... Overall, a good location with stable, amiable staff.

I used to frequent this Starbucks a couple years ago when I lived off of Jomax and enjoyed it.  I stopped back a couple weeks ago when I was in town and it was still the same.   ...  ... Starbucks-wise, they have the same menu as any other Starbucks.  What's annoying about this Starbucks is mainly the parking.  What a cluster.  It's an adventure just getting in and out of the lot without a fender bender.  I've never found the workers overly friendly either compared to some other Starbucks in the area.  The have a few tables outside that are sort of fun to sit at and watch the bumber cars and horns while you drink your coffee.  I don't know, if you live close it's probably your only option but there definitely are better Starbucks in the area.

REVIEW #18:  3 stars  (288 chars)
Service at this location is faster than the one on Pinnacle Peak Road (about 37th Ave).  But it still takes some time while the servers chat with their regulars.  Seems odd they cannot make the beverages while talking.  And work faster.  This company should know people have places to be.

REVIEW #19:  2 stars  (741 chars)
Having worked for Starbucks years ago I know what it's like behind the bar. What frustrates me about this particular store is it never really seems to be "busy" but they are consistently slow! I've been coming here since they built it and I've seen staff come and go. Still one of the slowest Starbucks locations I have ever been to! ...  ... I'm not sure why exactly but nobody ever seems to be in any kind of hurry behind the bar. It's aggravating knowing I used to be timed at how fast my crew could crank out drinks at some of the busiest stores in Arizona.  ...  ... I am a loyalist, and I'll keep drinking the coffee, but I think I'm done here and ready to find another location to visit. If you're in a hurry, STAY AWAY from this one.

REVIEW #20:  2 stars  (606 chars)
i used to be an everyday regular here. baristas knew me by name and had my drink memorized. service was always slow ... friendly (most of the time) but slow. but i kept coming back because they knew me. stopped by again thursday morning, hoping it had improved. it hadn't. from the time i walked in the door to the time i got my coffee, i had wasted 17 minutes of my morning on a damn latte (yes, i really did time it). screw it ... i just don't have time for this place. if i have an outrageous amount of time to waste, i happen to need coffee, and i'm in this parking lot, i may return, but probably not.

REVIEW #21:  2 stars  (507 chars)
Located in the strip that faces Lowe's, just a few doors down from Ray's pizza.  I've had bad service a few times at this location, the seating is excessively limited, and the parking can be bad at lunchtime because of the surrounding lunch spots.  Worst time is a weekend at lunch when the lunch parking & Lowe's parking are so bad that it fills the span of the parking lot between the two. ...  ... There are a lot of young college aged kids working at this location, so that could be part of the problem.

Obviously this wasn't built a Starbucks. It's more spacious than your average 'bucks, and has a cool little game room tucked away with a table to seat 8 or so. A few gents were playing chess while we were there. ...  ... Lots and lots of seating is available, although lots of it is taken by people working away on their computers. The customer service is excellent. ...  ... I had my first Fizzio (root beer). It was unexpectedly really good! Has a tinge of ginger in it, and with whipped cream on top it has a creamy aftertaste. I'm not a huge fan of cold coffee, so this might become my go-to cold drink.

We have been in a lot of Starbucks locations   all over. This particular one has a very unique store layout as it is on a corner and is in an L inside. Last night when we were here we wondered what the building was prior to becoming a Starbucks. Today we are in again. It is a very comfortable environment with lots of parking.  ...  ...

Hours are great - open until 10 pm.    ...  ... We went a few days after the Grand Opening.  The place was busy but not overwhelming.  The staff were friendly and kept the line moving well.  They're still working on getting their product and quantities adjusted to the right amount, but I'm sure it will all come together soon!  ...  ... Look forward to heading to Starbucks and stopping by Sprouts on a morning walk.  So convenient!   Welcome to the neighborhood, Starbucks!  Happy to have you here!

The layout and architecture of this Starbucks makes it a great place to work or read. It's very different than any other Starbucks I've been in.  ...  ... I've been here multiple times and the people that work there are always very nice and accommodating. Not only that, professional.  ...  ... I was there in the evening one time and some kids were being very loud both outside and inside.  After about ten minutes they told them they needed to go. I thought how they did it was nice and thoughtful to the other patrons.

This is your typical Starbucks with the typical menu, however, it's not a very typical set up. I was really impressed with this place, although the location next to a main road doesn't make it as appealing as a spot in cool section of the city. Considering that I have yet to see a cool section of Phoenix during my visits. ...  ... The pros: ...  ... 1.  Fantastic wifi. They use Google for their network and it works perfectly. No lag, no long loading times. Just perfect. Why don't all Starbucks use Google for their internet? ...  ... 2.  Very cool decor. I really liked the small room where people could get together for a lunch or evening meeting. Gave it a very official feeling. ...  ... 3.  Nice staff. Made the drinks just the right way. ...  ... The cons: ...  ... 1.  Not a fan of the location next to a main road. Has that strip mall ambiance going for it. ...  ... A good spot in general.

REVIEW #12:  3 stars  (579 chars)
New and clean Starbucks. Plenty of outdoor seating to enjoy when the weather is nice. The closed study room is a nice idea but sounds from main room echo through it. I wore headphones to cancel the noise. I also found the long bar table to be too close to the register. Too much traffic and noise to get much work done there. Also, the table chairs are not cushioned and pretty uncomfortable. There seems to be underutilized open space. I posted a picture of rude people taking up the whole row of seats (I'll take it down if that's not allowed). But anyways, don't be like them.

REVIEW #14:  2 stars  (1642 chars)
Hasn't happened to me in a while. I was almost delighted! ...  ... For years I avoided Starbucks because I just drink black coffee: Plain old black coffee. And for years Starbucks had the worst black coffee in the biz. It was burned-tasting, probably over-roasted in some effort to cut the sweetness of the tons of sugar most people want in their coffee confections. So when I'd go to Starbucks and they'd cheerily ask "what can I get started for you?" I'd just say "medium coffee, black" and usually they couldn't understand. Then I got attitude. I got sick of it. I stayed away in droves. ...  ... But then they came out with that Pikes Place branded stuff (everything needs to have a brand. Intellectual capital and all that) and it was ok and they stopped giving me attitude when I'd order it. Maybe Starbucks could be a coffee destination for me once again. ...  ... So it was with some delight that my order at the drive-thru speaker was greeted with a pause and soft-voiced incredulity. When I rolled up to the window, $2.50 in hand, I beheld the almost-offended haughty visage of a tattooed coffee artisan, who handed me a cup almost without making eye contact. "Two-eleven" he said, flatly. I handed him the money and said "keep it", trying to smooth over the poor dear's rankled nerves. But an artist, once offended, can't be assuaged with a mere tuppence. He said nothing and retreated to his lair behind the window, obviously there to ponder the banality of the philistine he had just encountered.  ...  ... And I was delighted. Because I can now safely go back to my previous prejudices regarding Starbucks. Mission Accomplished!

No coffee brewed and ready to serve at 9:00 AM with 7 people working behind the counter. They Forgot about me after it finished brewing. Half and half was empty. 20 minutes for a basic cup of coffee. Not the best baristas in the Starbucks system. At least the coffee tasted OK.

If I could give no stars I would. We came to Starbucks and went to the drive thru. There was only one car in front but still had to wait 10 min for two passion ice teas. So we get home and my pregnant friend was craving the ice so finished it in less then 5 min, To her surprise there was a fly in her drink! Yes it went as horribly as you expect it to go. Thanks Starbucks for not checking your ice while making iced drinks.

Definitely one of the better Starbucks in the area that I have been to.  I enjoy coming to this location a little bit more then the others for a variety of reasons. For starters, plenty of tables! I've been able to find a seat here every single time I've come over the last few weeks and this makes me very happy.  Also, for the most part, it's really clean.  The one time I needed a table wiped down (it was busy and the customer was walking out as I was walking in) it was done quickly by the barista. ...  ... Staff here is friendly and outgoing, and seem to do a good job of keeping it that way.  Place is well stocked, bathrooms are clean enough, and overall, I really enjoy coming here.  Even though it gets busy at times, its a far better experience then I've had at other Starbucks close to me. ...  ... Parking's a little tight, so be careful getting in and out, and it's in a strip mall, so there's lots of cars coming in and out.  Even though its an extra mile from my house, its worth coming here.  Free wifi as with all the other starbucks, and they have great hours too!

Everything they do they do with a smile. Fun and friendly baristas. Knowledgeable and informative when asked about a tumbler cup they had on sale. I'm looking for a trenta size refillable cup and they informed me I can actually use their cup they give and I'll get the discount. Thank you Starbucks!

REVIEW #4:  4 stars  (193 chars)
I like what they've done with the place. It accommodates the college students and those who come here to study. Kind of busy parking lot and the mornings are a bear to get in here. Good service

REVIEW #5:  3 stars  (163 chars)
Decent as far as Starbucks go. Kinda have to wait a while for things to come out even when they are not super busy.. Not bad at all just leave a bit to be desired.

REVIEW #6:  3 stars  (329 chars)
Definitely need more help in the mornings.  There is one lady who when I see her doing the drinks, I do not get anything that day.  She is slow and always seems like she doesn't know what she is doing.  I only love it when the young girls are working drinks.  Never ever come between 7-8:30 am, expect to wait 30 mins to get out.

REVIEW #7:  3 stars  (131 chars)
I still hate coffee. Why Starbucks then you ask? Easy. Smoothies and muffins. 1 extra star off for being on the west side. Ba-zing!

REVIEW #8:  3 stars  (1384 chars)
Okay, I'm not going to hate on the customer service of this Starbucks because it is WAY better than any of the other stores that are nearby. ...  ... And I'm not going to hate on their drinks, because it's really hard to mess up an iced coffee (it can be done, but you've really got to try to be lazy) ...  ... I will, however, hate on the last experience I had there: so I get my coffee, sit down to do some studying and a lady spills her drink outside-- no big deal, the barista heads out to clean up the mess and gets the lady another drink. While she's out there, the barista decides to sweep up the floor in the lobby... this is where I start having a bad day.  When she is sweeping, she is doing these long, swift strokes with the broom and kicking up a LOT of dust, random particles from people's shoes, etc. into the air around me... and she keeps doing this, over and over again until the air around me is pretty much filled with nastiness and I have to actually take off my glasses and clean them. ...  ... BLECH ...  ... I wouldn't recommend this place for a sit down study sesh, the one on 19th and Northern is better for that, BUT this bux is BY FAR a better deal when it comes to customer service at the counter or at the hand out-- just be sure to leave before they suffocate you with other people's dead skin, dirt and whatever else is hanging out on that lobby floor.

REVIEW #9:  3 stars  (269 chars)
Two stars because there isnt a drive thru.. and Im a lazy American who forgot that when you live abroad you walk for coffee and your needs.. Three stars because the peeps working are as friendly as it gets.. but the sugar/condiment bar is dirty.. clean it up Starbucks!

REVIEW #10:  2 stars  (948 chars)
I've been coming to this Starbucks for years I've always had such a pleasant experience Tiffany the manager has always been so nice to me and my family! But ever since the girl named gray has started working there my experience has been nothing but terrible! She has been rude to me on several occasions I've complained to the manager and I won't complain to her anymore because I do not want a free drink all I'm asking for is for gray to pleasant to me when I go and buy my drink at six am! She has an Issue with me and I'm not sure why! She refuses to make my drink right and when I ask her to make it correctly she always come back with a snotty remark she make me feel as if I'm a bother to her. I just want one simple thing done I want my drink that I paid for made correctly! Because of the way I am treated by gray I will no longer come to this Starbucks neither will my friends and family I refuse to be treated with such disrespect again!

REVIEW #11:  2 stars  (383 chars)
Two stars only because the ladies working were fabulous although the one chalked my chai full of ice..... Ummmm easy ice was stated in my order for a reason because I want alot of damn milk!!!  ... The floor was dirty and there were no clean tables....  ... Maybe the worker bees shouldn't focus on the fashionable friendly faggot(me) because honey.... You ain't gettin none of this!

REVIEW #12:  1 stars  (943 chars)
My gawd, have I been so blind?! Every morning I have a shot of espresso at home from my Miele (CVA 4070  Coffee System) with beans from Cafe Cortez. Each shot is velvety smooth with hints of smokiness and chocolate. This is probably one of finest shots of espresso just for me, every morning, except for... Friday. ...  ... I stay out at my bffs house way out in Surprise once a week to visit her and her bf.  So on my way in to work I sometimes stop by Starbucks for a Friday morning booster. So this morning I ordered a single shot of espresso and nearly choked. Simply horrible, its like a scorched burnt coffee taste that's so bitter while maintaining a weird sourness. My gawd this stuff is pure shit. I cant believe it, after all these years I finally see the light. Starbucks coffee for me is utter crap.  ...  ... I pitched it in the garbage and have sworn off Starbucks. The single star is for the wonderfully cute and perky "barista"

REVIEW #13:  1 stars  (313 chars)
They can't get my order right here. I will never come back here. I gave them 3 tries and wasted money because I don't have time to go back an get my order fixed. Idk what's so hard about making an iced coffee with syrup and whole milk but these people can't seem to get it and also have an attitude while doing it

Listen, all you coffee snobs and hipsters out there, I know how much you hate the corporate coffee world.  Their cookie cutter green storefronts, drive-thrus, unassuming wooden furniture, and the latest and greatest jack Johnson clone playing on the speaker system.  Well I say to you, who cares?  I'm here for one reason and one reason only, and that's to further perpetuate my caffeine addiction, and there's no doubt that Starbucks' lighter roasts have some of the most caffeinated kick of any coffee out there.  So go to your totally underground hipster coffee joints where your baristas make hearts in your foam and talk about the best new music they read about on pitchfork.com, but don't come crying to me when you inevitably find that the evil empire that is Starbucks is so popular for a reason: they have good tasting strong coffee, friendly employees, and a comfortable atmosphere.  Anyways, this particular location is the bomb regardless of if I get hit on by the dude in the drive through window on a consistent basis....how can I blame him?

This Starbuck's crew is the best. Call 30 minutes in advance and they still had to traveling joe's ready for me when I arrived. Always get my drinks right, and the one time they have ran out of lemonade they gave me a coupon for next time to get a free what every size and kind drink. WoW and I did not even have to ask, they just gave it to me with my new drink and an apology

REVIEW #6:  5 stars  (302 chars)
Yup - - love this Starbucks!!  ...  ... The staff is always super, super friendly. Love the way they greet you... just helps to put a smile on your face.  ...  ... I typically (98%) go through the Drive-Thru, and I have never had any issues with my order. It's fast... and a great Starbucks experience.

REVIEW #7:  4 stars  (490 chars)
Although, I try to go out of my way not to support "the coffee machine". I wandered in here while waiting for a ride.. ...  ... First person I meet is "Summer" she was completely & utterly full of sass & jokes. I loved her! She took my order & we joked throughout my wait.  ...  ... The interaction with the staff overall was just dope. It was lively, no one had any attitudes. I'm not big on Starbucks in general but I haven't received similar service from some of the local spots I visit.

REVIEW #8:  4 stars  (1412 chars)
I come here for meetings almost once per week or once every two weeks. I got in the morning between 8:30-9:30 and stay for a while. The servers are all very friendly. I noticed one of the servers remembers people from before, and in-between rush orders, they are often cleaning up the area.  ...  ... A major plus for this location is that they have lots of seating and lots of plug-ins for those of us who use our laptops.  There are several small tables, a larger table, and tables by the comfortable bench area.  ...  ... The only complaints I have is that it's often busy, I cannot get a seat, and sometimes, the tables are crummy with someone's previous snack. Also, the sun is so darn bright in there at times. Of course, the sun annoys me most of the time anyway, but the shades on the windows only come about halfway down, and the sun is blinding. The parking lot can be kind of annoying too, depending on when one gets there/leaves.  ...  ... If you log into their (now) free wifi, there's a free song of the week. I have liked all my free songs of the week, a perk of going to Starbucks.  ...  ... I can't say I love Starbucks coffee, but I love their tea and option of snacks. They have the kind of granola bars I like, dark chocolate, fruit, and some other items that are quite tasty.  ...  ... The music is often the same every week I go, and sometimes it can get overly loud, but it's not that bad.

REVIEW #9:  4 stars  (256 chars)
I go to this location often (2-4 per week). The staff is always friendly and my order is accurate. The line usually isn't to bad but I've noticed Monday mornings seem to be pretty long for drive thru. So avoid on Monday AM and you should have fast service.

REVIEW #10:  4 stars  (185 chars)
I love the Green Tea Frapps! Service at the drive-thru and inside is fast. Rarely crowded. I think it is a hidden gem. I've been here and sat outside. There is always seating available.

REVIEW #11:  4 stars  (750 chars)
I love this Starbucks and everyone that works here.  They're awesome!  Everyone in my office is a big fan and we can be found here often.  I do wish it were a bit bigger as it can get a little cramped at times. ...  ... My only aggrevation with this location is in regards to the ill-mannered (or are they just entitled?) customers in the drive thru that think it's okay to block the driveway (and sometimes even line up in the street) because they apparently can't be bothered to park and walk inside.  Honestly, I would love to know what is going on in the heads of these people when they are nonchalantly parked diagonally across the driveway, clearly preventing people from entering or exiting the parking lot.  Perhaps ignorance really IS bliss.

REVIEW #12:  3 stars  (449 chars)
I know this place is over priced, but this place is the only coffee house near my work and I tried to come here as often as I can.  Everyone here are all very nice and have a great attitude on working here.  Service is fast and accurate.  They even have a drive-thru window for those that doesn't want to go inside the store.  They also don't have a lot of parking nearby and sometimes you will need to park in the back of the complex and walk over.

REVIEW #13:  3 stars  (233 chars)
Just like any other Starbucks we have around, coffee works for me on my monday madness. I deal with the line, whether in drive-through or inside, for the bolt of energy. Staff is friendly and as quick as they can be during rush hour.

REVIEW #14:  3 stars  (1331 chars)
Some people may argue that a free drink is worth any price but I have to disagree.  This is the closest, free standing SB drive throuhg to my apartment and I normally utilize the drive through.  I don't understand why you can't get a better menu at the drive.  Maybe your die hard regulars remember this kind of stuff but I don't always remember all the items available to order.  And the drive through menu is more likely to sell you on food instead than on coffee drinks. ...  ... Over the past year I mostly go to SB once or twice a month at best.  In that time frame I have had at least 7 Complimentary drinks through the drive though because of the time it took to prepare them.  Some people say "hey, free drink" but when you spend 20 min in the drive through (I know I gauged my time through Kelly Clarkson songs) you start to wish you had the option to drive, far far away from the drive through. ...  ... I do give many cust service points to SB for the on the house frappachino when I finally got to the window but why does this always have to happen!  You are always quick to give me a free coffee when my wait gets long but who wants to sit for 15-20 min over an iced coffee?  Maybe you should take a look at your business model and figure out why I have had 7 free drinks in a year due to bad service at this location?

REVIEW #15:  3 stars  (401 chars)
The location is next to Jimmy Johns but the drive-thru can get very hairy. The parking situation isn't great at this location. I ordered a caramel macchiato thru the drive-thru and it took at least 5 minutes to finally get my drink at the window. I would say this was one of the slower experiences I've had at a starbucks. The worst part, my drink was wrong, but didn't notice until after I drove off.

REVIEW #16:  2 stars  (366 chars)
I really do love Starbucks. ... But this location ALWAYS forgets to put sweetener in my tea and we always drive off realizing it's too late to turn back because turning back is just even more inconvenient. ...  ... It's just really annoying and this Starbucks is a really nice one, considering the ghetto surroundings of a closed down grill next door and strip club.

REVIEW #17:  2 stars  (486 chars)
I'd give it 3.5 stars if I could. This is the only Starbucks on my way to work, soooooo there you have it. The drivethru line is always time consuming, regardless of the time you get there, but the wait staff are super friendly and accommodating. They don't hesitate to give you a free drink if you've patiently waited in their queue. However, don't come here if you're already running late to work... come here if you have lots of time to kill and would like to win a free drink lotto.

REVIEW #18:  2 stars  (155 chars)
It's a Starbucks.  I come here because it's next to my office and I don't have time to go to a place with good coffee.  At least it's consistent and quick.

REVIEW #19:  2 stars  (657 chars)
This Starbucks needs to work on their listening skills when taking orders from drive through customers. Since this location happens to be on my way to work, I'll stop by it occasionally. The problem is that they are so busy because they are located on such a huge intersection. Therefore, most of the time when I go here they get my order incorrect. And when I'm forking over almost 4 bucks for a nonfat latte, I don't want to experience issues getting my drink. Sometimes the line is also so long that it reaches all the way into the street.... I'd pass on this location as I'm sure there are probably less crowded locations that can take orders correctly!

REVIEW #20:  1 stars  (1068 chars)
I had to take a couple of hours to calm down to write this review.  I have never been so annoyed in my life. ...  ... I usually go to the Starbucks on 16th St...but they don't have a drive thru.  The one on Thomas/32st has the worst service, so I decided to the 44th St location today.  I was craving a Roasted Pepper Panini today real bad. ...  ... I get up to the drive-thru to order my panini  ...  ... "No, you caaaaaaaaan't haaaaave that! I am soooooo sorrrrrrrrrryyyyyy.  We have been waiting for a new order to come in." ...  ... "Oh...well, do you have any other paninis?" ...  ... Instead of her answering, she said "You will have to stay in the drive thru line, but it doesn't look like it's that long" ...  ... Great...now I am stuck in a drive thru line that I can't get out of.  I was held hostage.  There wasn't anything else I wanted.  So I had to wait 20 mintues to get out of the drive thru.   ...  ... Funny thing, the person in front of me got a coupon for a free drink because they were out of what they ordered as well.  I, of course, got nothing.

I have been coming to this Starbucks everyday for 4 years now. I am so glad the management has changed it's already making a big difference the employees seem happier! The cleanliness of the store has gone up. Most of the morning baristas have been there since before I started coming in and know me by name. They have my drink ready before I even get into the store. Karen Viki and missy have been there forever. I don't know why this store has so many bad reviews I guess some People you just can't make happy. Yea sometimes you have to wait for a drink but if u come in and the line is out the door there going to be a wait these people aren't superheroes. This store is run very tight and i think its starbucks as a company thats to blame. These guys and girls work very hard for minimum wage and should be rewarded! Keep up the hard work!

REVIEW #2:  5 stars  (254 chars)
I've never been displeased with this location. It is across the street from work and even though we have a "Starbucks" in our cafeteria we come here. Better selection, plus we get out of the building. Everyone working here has always been super friendly.

Always mess up my order. I went in with my wife and there was 1 person behind me waiting to order. I was told that I couldn't pay seperatly to get 2 stars. I had to combine my order. I could understand if they were really busy.

REVIEW #4:  4 stars  (260 chars)
Great customer service.  I called in to order 6 coffees.  Got to the store and only 4 were correct.  Geez.  The lady apologized.  She gave me all I wanted.  My order!  Then a manager gave me a $10 gift card for the trouble.  Thank you for keep customers happy.

REVIEW #5:  4 stars  (336 chars)
I'm a regular at this Starbucks. Never had a bad experience. Always a solid product, the staff, especially the young redhead, has been terrific. No caffeine coffeehouse airs here. Plenty of seating inside plus a large wooden table and comfy chairs. A number of tables outside perfect for me my iPad and a tall cold ice tea.  Free wi-fi.

I love the fact that this location is close to the theater because I study and do homework for school before I hang out. I understand all the baristas are busy helping customers but wish the store could be a little cleaner to include the restrooms. I am a health food journalist with the Examiner and I have visited the Starbucks at the Happy Valley Norterra location and they are always clean. Hope to see changes soon but the crew are amazing they really are.

I don't hit the corporate crack pipe too often, but when I do, I love me some banana nut loaf and Chai tea! For some reason though- this location, the last couple of times that I have ordered the bread it has been semi-stale.  I mean, at 490 calories a whack- it should taste PHENOMENAL!

REVIEW #10:  2 stars  (249 chars)
The service is so slow.  Short staffed.  The lady at the register is very nice and really tries.  They have only 1 person making drinks at any given time and in the morning it is horrible,  Only store in the area.  Avoid!!  Lunch time is even worst.

REVIEW #11:  2 stars  (495 chars)
This Starbucks is one i go to ONLY when i am shopping in the deer valley amc area. I would NEVER go out of my way to come here. The staff is so unfriendly, it honestly makes me sick. There are always new people and i have come across only maybe 2 or 3 that have been somewhat friendly. This Starbucks is dirty (maybe clean the bathroom once in a while?!) My drink is never ever made right, they slop it together. Honestly, don't waste your time coming here unless you are in dire need of coffee.

I feel the need to review this Starbucks because, well, when I was in there, it was without a doubt the most disgusting coffee shop I've ever seen (and I've worked for that generic 'independent' coffee shop we all know).  I've been a student for ages now and have been to many a Starbucks in my day and this is, by far, the nastiest one I've seen.  I hate to knock a place purely for how it looks, but when the tables are nasty, there's dust on the windowsills, and food debris everywhere....it doesn't seem that appetizing.  I know it may be a recession and you're suffering but seriously, clean up your act Starbucks.

REVIEW #15:  1 stars  (274 chars)
pathetic customer service...  ordered a decaf for my mom.  they said they don't brew after noon but they would start a pot.  after 7-10 min of waiting I went to check on it and they didn't even have it started yet!  just canceled the order cuz we had to make our movie time.

REVIEW #16:  1 stars  (214 chars)
The bathroom is disgusting, it should be check on regularly, especially when there are 3 of you working an no one actually doing anything and you're not busy. ...  ... As far as service and product, it's Starbucks.

REVIEW #17:  1 stars  (371 chars)
They commit the ultimate sin for a coffee shop: milk is NEVER available over at the drink station. No milk of any kind. And then when you go up to the barista stand to ask for milk, some of them give you the stink-eye.  ...  ... If it didn't have the built-in traffic from the movie theater next door and American Express and Petsmart, this Starbucks would tank but fast.

REVIEW #18:  1 stars  (1269 chars)
They should just shut this location down. I can not get a drink to come out of that store correctly to save my life. I am not exaggerating, my drinks are wrong more than they are right. I will give them some credit, when I order a drip..they nail it ever time.  ...  ... This issue has been going on long before the whole "New management" story.  ...  ... They write out your drink right and then you walk out with it completely wrong. ...  ... Wrong sizes, missing ingredients...obvious ingredients and my favorite, coffee grounds at the bottom of your cup.  ...  ... AVOID at all costs. Trust me, the drive down the road to a different Starbucks is worth your time. I promise.  ...  ... I go to this location everyday for one reason only, it's super close to my house. I try to go to locations by my school or work but in the morning when you want your coffee before your drive you hit up the one closest to you.  ...  ... I have called and called and called and called to try and let them know something needs to change. Eventually the business will dry up and the lazy employees will be with out a place to go to work.  ...  ... Today was my final incorrect drink. I will be taking my daily spending to a new location. Trust me, the amount I spend will make a dent.

REVIEW #19:  1 stars  (293 chars)
Very disappointed with this location. I was told they were out of sausage breakfast sandwiches and then someone 20 minutes after me was able to get a sausage sandwich while I was sitting right there. No sense of urgency by anyone working there and it seems understaffed no matter when I go in.

I probably visit 100 different Starbucks per year in my travels.  This is 1 of my favorites.  The store font is perfect and captures the beauty of the Phoenix Sunrise which makes the mood that much more perfect at a coffee shop in the AM.  The staff is very friendly and upbeat as should be the case for a morning coffee shop.  The patio is huge with lots of outdoor seating and the inside is really cool how they have a long leather bench that runs the length of the store and lots of 2 tops all the way down it.  Lots of seating and comfortable.

I stopped here only to buy 5 gift cards, so I didn't actually buy any drinks or other items. ... The young girl that helped me had some trouble ringing the 5pack, so we decided for 5 individual cards. ... She was very nice and helpful, and when I misplaced my credit card (as I often do : ( she was very clever to check the gift card display... silly me I had left it there while checking out the gift cards available. ...  ... I spent a week training at Interface and I did like the outdoor seating they have at this location. It is very nice and friendly.

REVIEW #4:  4 stars  (372 chars)
I stopped by this starbucks because of the awesome patio deck. Great service and even better atmosphere to have a coffee in. I especially liked the huge couch theyare had in the back. ...  ... If you stop in you can guarantee that this place will almost always be super busy, lots of outdoor seating so if you are down with this awesome az weather, have your java outside.

REVIEW #5:  4 stars  (515 chars)
My go-to study starbucks. Plenty of indoor and outdoor seating. Music's usually not too loud. Wifi could be spotty sometimes but there are a couple of active networks. Their attwifi is not as reliable as the google wifi down at Starbucks, Indian School and 28th. Sometimes there's a spanish club that comes here to practice. I don't know what's proper coffee shop etiquette, but I think it's pretty rude to start jabbering away loudly when everyone else is quietly studying. I know I'm in a public space, but still!

REVIEW #6:  4 stars  (381 chars)
This location is nearly always busy; but the staff works hard to keep the lines moving and getting drinks out on time.  ...  ... It's clean, good location with plenty of indoor and outdoor seating. The recent remodel was a much needed improvement.  ...  ... If you are in a rush in the mornings...either get here early or find a different location. Still, it's a great place to be.

REVIEW #7:  4 stars  (492 chars)
When thing I love about this Starbucks is the seating outside.  The landscaping is really beautiful and the trees are really tall.   ...  ... This Starbucks is in Park Central.  Park Central has been around longer then I have been alive.  I do remember back in the day when I was a teenager that there was a Dillard's outlet store in this shopping center.   ...  ... Anyways, I always enjoy coming to this Starbucks and drinking my coffee outside under a tree with either my hubby or friends.

REVIEW #8:  2 stars  (164 chars)

Not so happy campers here...maybe they need to drink some shots or drinks??? ...  ... 2nd time here since it's a pass by location when visiting the family.

Now, getting a small $25 gift card for part of a birthday gift was a reason to go again.  Machi was fine, shots were strong (was a good thing), but an issue with my Very Berry Hibiscus.  No berries??? and I was told it was for looks.   And when the coffee drinker wanted some half & half, she gets handed a carton of Albertsons.  ...  ... After a few drinks on the way I gave up.  The berries do make a difference:( ...  ... I guess not all Starbucks are not on the same page...especially in Carefree, AZ.

Decided to try this Starbucks as it has a Clover machine. Had a Komodo Dragon and it was very flavorful. Everything about this Starbucks is up to the usual high standards. Not the most parking-friendly location, but there is ample parking if you are willing to walk 50 meters or so. Nice friendly baristas. Lots of sitting space.

Great beverages, and incredible service:). The Manager of this unit was awesome.  Very personable, with sincere and authentic care and concern for her guests.  Motivated me to create this account and write a review:)

I love this place so much!!! Amazing location, incredible views, and the staff is at the highest of customer service standards.  ...  ... They remember the regulars, they're  all very light hearted and great at making our drinks!!! They have the new Clover, and Fizzio!!! They are amazing!!

REVIEW #4:  5 stars  (350 chars)
Not a lot to say here. Nice Starbucks. Large, clean, kept to a comfortable temperature, like most Starbucks. The staff seem attentive and stuff, like most Starbucks. Bathrooms are clean, like Starbucks. Music is quiet and backgroundy, like most Starbucks. Internet works well, like most Starbucks. Nothing too original or unique, like most Starbucks.

REVIEW #5:  5 stars  (417 chars)
One of my fav Starbucks! Cant beat the location-- looking at Squaw Peak mountains is awesome.   Lots of seating and nice set up inside store.  Friendly customer service from all staff. I drink tons of coffee -many of them  free refills because of my gold card status and they never make me feel guilty or bad.    ...  ... I highly recommend checking out this location when you want good coffee in a pretty atmosphere.

REVIEW #7:  4 stars  (959 chars)
This is the former location of the Russ Lyon Realty office that was at N. 32nd St & E. Lincoln Dr near the 32nd St. Trailhead.  Starbucks just opened this morning and I happened to be driving by.  The staff is friendly and apparently the whole crew from a North Scottsdale store moved down to this spot to open it. ( A guy that lives in Scottsdale and works down the road from here said that it was really cool, and odd.  Kind of like deja vu for him.) ...  ... There is a small patio of to the side with tables, chairs, and a misting system.  Located right beside the newly moved Squaw Peak Animal Hospital, this Starbucks is sure to attract a hiking and dog-friendly crowd.  Parking will be challenging, there isn't a drive-thru and the cool patio is off the side, somewhat oddly oriented. ...  ... I would visit this plaza often when At One Yoga was still in operation (if they had known that Starbucks was moving in, maybe they wouldn't have closed shop?)

REVIEW #8:  2 stars  (351 chars)
I was in the area this morning, and stopped in for my "hang." They didn't have dark roast. The woman said she'd brew some, but laughed at me when I suggested that coffee prepared with different methods tasted different. So I left, and went to a different location where they had dark roast available, and treated me and their own product with respect.

REVIEW #2:  4 stars  (347 chars)
Why the four stars? No parking. Well, not enough parking. We went through the parking lot at least three times hoping to find a spot and had to resort to parking next door. The coffee? Of course, it was wonderful! Hubby had an iced coffee, and he NEVER has iced coffee but Phoenix is just too hot to have hot coffee in the middle of the afternoon!

REVIEW #3:  3 stars  (177 chars)
Friendly staff, quick drive through. Normal products for Starbucks ...getting a little pricy since the price hike. If you register and refil your gift card you can earn rewards.

REVIEW #4:  3 stars  (546 chars)
I can see why this place has a less-than-stellar rating. I went on a Thursday for a little afternoon pick-me-up. The location was easy to find and the drive-thru was easy to maneuver. However, the service is what gives them a 3-star rating. I pulled up and did not receive a smile from the barista, something that Starbucks usually prides itself on. The transaction was "quick and dirty", in fact I didn't really know the transaction was over, he just walked away from the window. Hmmph. Less than impressed, but hey, at least I got my goodies :)

REVIEW #5:  3 stars  (1368 chars)
I've been doing this trend lately where I wait until I check into a place on the Yelp app before I write a review, even if I've been to the place before. Well,...it just so happens that the time I checked in was one of the worst experience I've ever had at this Starbucks. ...  ... My husband and I decided to stop by to get a small breakfast with coffee. I ordered a Mocha (no-whip) and he ordered a Caramel Macchiato along with our food.  ...  ... We got out food immediately (because that just how they do it.), but our drinks on the other hand...took 18! minutes. Now, don't get me wrong, it's not like the place was packed. It was just us, another woman behind us in line and a couple other people already enjoying their drinks. ...  ... There were three staff members working. I could tell there were some drive-through orders, but it just didn't seem to make sense that we hadn't gotten our drinks yet. THEN the girl that ordered after us got both of her drinks and left. We stood there waiting... Luckily they noticed us waiting and finished our drinks finally, but as we were waiting our food got cold and our moods spoiled. ...  ... I haven't had as horrible of experiences here - they are normally pretty, well normal - but this time was different and that's why I'm giving it 3 stars. A mixture of good experience with bad - right in the middle seems fair.

REVIEW #6:  3 stars  (663 chars)
It sad that I give this place 3 stars considering I have been going there everyday for 3 years.  Mainly it is the place on the way to work closest to my house.   ...  ... This place is busy and they haven't seemed to figure out how to run the drive thru and the inside, it floors me sometimes that they don't have more employees on the machine.  The don't seem to get the morning rush, I am often 15 minutes late to work because they move slow ...  ... They do finally know me there - took a while but now they make my coffee how I like it, weekend crew hit or miss.   ...  ... I will continue to go because it is my place and close.  I just wish they were faster

REVIEW #7:  3 stars  (472 chars)
Typical Starbucks. Yes, drive thru is available - entrance is on the right. I had a coupon that (I did not know) was linked to one of my gift cards that had no money left in it, but the barista was kind enough to let me pay with my gift card that did have money in it! And, he was super cool and friendly.   ...  ... Awesome because of the hours (they close at 10 pm while others close at 9 pm) and the baristas, but I'd never come back because it's in such a shady area..

REVIEW #8:  2 stars  (1648 chars)
Anyone who knows me that I am a fan of Starbucks.  After having been turned on to them about five years ago, I have never looked back.  Every Starbucks that I have gone to has had exceptional customer service. ...  ... Except this one. ...  ... I usually order one item:  a grande skinny mocha latte, hot.  I have ordered enough at different Starbucks to know when it is made right, and when it's been royally hijacked.  With this Starbucks, it's a 50/50 chance that the drink will be right.  And, frankly, I'm too lazy to bother to complain or have the staff make another one. ...  ... My biggest complaint about this location, however, is the staff.  I often would go here to get schoolwork done or to work on projects for my clients, so I could sometimes spend three to four hours inside.  The amount of vulgar language that I heard coming from their mouths as they bantered with each other was astonishing.  And it wasn't as if they were whispering it; they were openly using this language.  I would hear them talk about their romantic lives, sometimes in details.  How these employees remain employed is beyond me.  What I heard is simply deplorable. ...  ... I have since moved from that location and go to a different Starbucks 12 miles or so away.  I made it a point to go back to this Starbucks to see if anything had changed in the six months since my last visit--and it hadn't.  Within one hour of sitting inside doing project work, I heard the expletives as they were bantering. ...  ... If you have any sense of professionalism about you or are offended by an occasional expletive from the staff, I would steer away from this location.

So by now everyone knows about the Starbucks running water fiasco, right? ...  ... http://abcnews.go.com/International/SmartHome/Story?id=5964908&page=1 ...  ... I drive up to the "almost in the hood" new store, and while I'm waiting for my grande, extra hot caramel macciado with half 2% milk and half whole milk, one splenda, no whipped cream, but drizzle the caramel on top?  Oh yeah, and can I have it double-cupped instead of one of those sleevey-things and while I'm waiting at the window I look over and see that little friggin spigot just running for no apparent reason. WTF I say, it's true.   ...  ...  ... They let the water run all the time!  What ass-clown came up with that idea?

REVIEW #10:  2 stars  (301 chars)
So the service was good--timing, acceptional since we were in no rush..  ...  ... Ordered a venti iced coffee & a tall White Mocha (hot) ...  ... But she didn't give us a straw for the iced coffee.. and we had driven off before we noticed.  Maybe she was a new barista because she seemed a bit nervous

REVIEW #11:  2 stars  (1269 chars)
When you go to a Starbucks on Thomas Rd, I suppose it's only fair to adjust expectations accordingly, as I did. This gem of a Starbucks, however, took my lowered expectations, met them, and said "we can go lower." ...  ... Parking is abysmal. 50/50 chance during peak hours you'll need to park next door. Keep in mind there's also always an option to keep driving. Once you enter, you'll be greeted with a friendly cold shoulder. Quality customer service here. ...  ... The bathrooms, if you have my luck, may be out of both rolls of toilet paper. Don't be a fool like me and proceed before checking. If you have the bad luck of reading this on the toilet, and you are now checking the toilet dispenser, realizing that it's too late, fear not. You don't need to go Indian style, you can use the toilet seat covers in a pinch. Not for the dainty, but better than the alternative. ...  ... If you're like me and you want to save the next guy from the terrible dilemma depicted above by informing the staff, prepare to be thanked with expert levels of passive aggression. ...  ... Altogether not my favorite Starbucks experience, but the drink was potable so 2 stars. ...  ... Good if you: wipe with your hands ... Bad if you: are snobby about things like customer service

REVIEW #12:  1 stars  (585 chars)
I'm not a big Starbucks fan but I have a gift card from work and it'll do in a pinch. The drive thru line wrapped all through the parking lot so I parked and went inside. The staff was courteous and I just had a plain coffee.  ... The other clientele I found to be pretty snotty self entitled yuppies. In the parking lot, I almost get hit by some guy rushing through. I start backing out and this guy jumps in his sports car slams it into reverse and almost hits another car and leans on his horn!!!  ... Anyways, it's been awhile since I've been to a Starbucks and now I remember why.

REVIEW #13:  1 stars  (388 chars)
Ok, seriously @Starbucks, there should not be visible evidence on the toilet seat that the prior user was... um.... having a bad day. ...  ... Gross. ...  ... No other comments. That's just unacceptable. ...  ... BTW: after being there at least 90 minutes, I used the restroom again just prior to leaving, and there had been zero cleaning done. ...  ... NEVER GOING BACK TO THIS LOCATION!

This is the only drive-thru location on my way to work and it is usually pretty busy but they seem to get us through quickly (haven't been late yet!). They are always friendly and quick. Only once did I notice my drink wasn't quite sweet enough but I am kind of a sugar-holic when it comes to coffee. Maybe they were trying to do my pancreas a favor.

Okay so we all know what to expect from Starbucks. The selection is the same. So what it really comes down to is the staff. And this location happens to have superb staff. I always end up leaving this place with a smile on my face, regardless if I'm having a grumpy, frumpy morning. I'm sure the fact that I'm leaving with a giant cup of caffeine helps with that... but the people working the drive-thru are always quick with a smile and laugh, and seem to genuinely want to spread those smiles to the customer.

REVIEW #11:  4 stars  (682 chars)
Okay, okay. I broke my promise, I returned! I was in a rush and the drive-thru seemed like a promising alternative. I drove up to the ordering board pessimistically, well knowing that my service this morning would be atrocious. Much to my surprise, the woman who took my order asked how my morning was, and she....THOUGHTFULLY responded to my reply! (This is a rare one in the drive-thru industry kiddos)  ...  ... After a few short minutes of waiting behind an Escalade far too large for the small driveway to pay for his coffee, I pulled up to the window. I received good coffee too! And smiling employees! I was in shock.  ...  ... Kudos for making improvements guys, keep it up.

Okay, so I went to this Starbucks on Saturday and ordered my usual caf mocha and a breakfast sandwich,the sausage classic. ...  ... They did not have one so they offered me a spinach-type breakfast sandwich. It was hard as a rock, overcooked, old and I threw it away. ...  ... I went by today, which is Thursday, ordered my caf mocha and the sausage classic sandwich and, once again, it was old, stale, overcooked and hard as a rock. Had to throw it away as well. ...  ... I called the store and the lady said, "what do you want us to do for you"  i said a gift certificate would be nice. Her suggestion was that I drive all the way back to their store to pick it up...Even though I had just said I could not come back to get another sandwich! Ridiculous!! ...  ... I will not go back!!

REVIEW #15:  1 stars  (442 chars)
Service this morning was abysmal. I changed locations this morning, running late in hopes that the drive-thru would be more speedy. Yeah, right. ...  ... The line moved painstakingly slooooowwwww. When I got my coffee, it was barely 2/3 full, and the rest was all whipped cream. I ordered a Venti Vanilla Latte. I'm not going to pay five dollars for a cup full of whipped cream, I wanted the coffee.  ...  ... Last time I visit this location.

REVIEW #16:  1 stars  (500 chars)
The new reduced fat turkey bacon sandwich is TERRIBLE.  Why did you mess with a great thing?  The original with the whole wheat english muffin, egg whites and turkey bacon was so good.  I will never buy the new one again.....and probably will never buy any food items at Starbucks again.  Terrible.  Disappointing.  To add insult to injury, my husband's Veggie Egg sandwich was hard as a rock when we got home.  What a waste of money!  Pay attention to details and understand what your client's want.

As far as Starbucks go, this one is my favorite.  The staff there is always so friendly and ready to serve you with a smile.  Unlike most coffee shops (that are run by hipsters and burnouts) these people truly care about you and what you've done with your day.  They are also the only store I've been to that asks me if I would like to try something different in my drink, like adding mocha to a chai or caramel sauce to the pumpkin spice.  There is always high turnover at places like this, so negative reviews should be taken with a grain of salt, as a large percentage of the staff is different from one year ago.

REVIEW #3:  4 stars  (603 chars)
I like this location a lot because this Starbucks is quick, convenient and unlike other reviews I've never ever encountered an issue with my drink - a major plus because sometimes walking into a Starbucks can be a nightmare in the morning. ...  ... The crew here is lightening speed fast, and they take your order practically once you walk in the door to help get you on your way. Most of the people who walk in are in a rush to get to work, and finally I've found a Starbucks that actually understands that. This is just a cheerful place to be in the morning, it's your friendly neighborhood Starbucks.

REVIEW #4:  4 stars  (1182 chars)
The parking is the worst problem here... during the day the lot is JAMMED: too few spaces for too many businesses! Otherwise I'd give them 5 stars... ...  ... Having said that,I'm a certified Starbucks Junkie, and a "regular" here. This location is where I stop for coffee and a snack after leaving my workout 3 days every week, and where I stop to buy my GF her favorite vanilla latte. The service is good, the staff is top-notch, and I like the layout of the interior. My drink orders are always correct. I never get the "Sorry, we're out of Pike Place" syndrome that I often get in the afternoon when I stop at other Starbucks locations. The service is as fast as Starbucks ever gets (not the highest bar to reach, I know). And, after going into a LOT of Starbucks, where the staff act like a bunch of slackers, the gang here really CARE... their performance shows it! ...  ... This store is more clean, neat and organized than most other other locations, too... the Starbucks nearest my house is a PIGSTY behind the counter by comparison.  ...  ... I drive past 3 Starbucks on the way home from the Gym: this one is least convenient to get into, and it's STILL the one I prefer!

REVIEW #5:  2 stars  (519 chars)
Any true Starbucks fan has visited probably 50 different locations.  Well, I'll just say that out of the 10+ times I've been here, this is still the worst. ...  ... I don't want to sound negative, so I'll just admit that I've never received quality customer service, and that parking here is an absolute nightmare (which is NOT their fault, so I gave them 2 stars).   ...  ... Their customer service is more painful than a kick to the face with a golf shoe. ...  ... On a more positive note...  Hey, the sun is shining!

REVIEW #6:  1 stars  (743 chars)
I've been in town for a conference and have stopped at this starbucks several times.  The first time I went visited this location, there was a fly buzzing around the pastries.  I went back a couple times later and they were incredibly slow and were serving drinks out of order.     ...  ... I went back today and I had to walk out because I couldn't wait any longer.  The pastry case was empty (at 4 pm) and they had to give a free drink coupon to the customer in front of me because they were out of something to make her drink with.  I visit starbucks around the country on a regular basis and this was the slowest by far.  There doesn't seem to be any urgency in their pace.  I've given this establishment several chances.  I won't be back.

REVIEW #7:  1 stars  (1200 chars)
This place is TERRIBLE : I would give no stars, but that is not an option. ...  ... If you want anything more than drip coffee you are SOL.  And be specific about your drip coffee order  ("room for cream", sometimes means "half full") ...  ... I will recount my latest experience in a long string of "one more chance" visits to this specific location. ... It was cold and rainy, and perfect weather for a nice warm drink.  I arrived, ordered my drink AND . . . ... I waited for my Latte (a simple 2 shot, short Latte, nothing fancy here). ... I watched as the "barrista" FINALLY pulled the two shots for my latte . .  ... Then let the cup sit, for a few minutes . . .  ... He then poured milk into the latte, BUT stopped about half way full?!  ... There the making of my drink stopped . . .  ... It wasn't served to me half full, it just sat there getting colder. . . ... I waited, and waited, and looked on expectantly. . .  ...  ... After 15 minutes of waiting, and then watching this idiot make half of my latte, I realized that whatever "drink" I would get would be cold by the time I got it. ... So I finally had it and left (mind you I had already paid!!!!!).  Never again, I done with the BUX.

Good neighborhood Starbucks. I love that there is a drive thru here. It makes it so convenient to swing through on your way to run errands on a Saturday. Only real criticism is the drive thru line. It's always long. But that's just because we are all too lazy to go inside.

REVIEW #5:  4 stars  (234 chars)

I like this location, it is clean and the staff is friendly.  The drive thru is SUPER SLOW so if you're in a rush, get out of your car and walk inside.  This is the main location in ahawatukee, so it is packed most of the time.  Not too much sitting space inside, so it's more of a place for a quick meeting or get your coffee and go.  Otherwise, another one of my places for coffee!

This is a good location, and constantly busy! They have good service, everyone has a great attitude, and the lobby is nice and comfortable.  ...  ...

Be ready to cram through some tight spots and dodge some cars if you are there when it's busy!

REVIEW #9:  3 stars  (348 chars)
I prefer to go to local coffee shops and support them rather than go to Starbucks. My only issue with this Starbucks is that the staff aren't very friendly rather you're going through the drive-thru or going inside. This one was right next to my house so I would stop in purely based on convenience but if I had time I'd go somewhere else for sure.

REVIEW #10:  3 stars  (549 chars)
This is my second choice location when I'm looking to fill my Starbucks requirement for the day. ...  ... It has a drive thru so this works for when I'm a bit on the lazy side. ...  ... The barista's are always helpful but have spoken down about other Starbucks locations and that just leaves a bad taste in my mouth (not coffee, just put downs). ...  ... Note to Starbucks - if you are listening - the piadini thingy with the spinach and feta was sooooo good, why, oh why did it leave and can it come back? - This would get me back into this store.

This is a horrible Starbucks! They consistently mess up and don't compensate for it.  It's very disappointing because we love Starbucks! Both gold members and now have to find a new Starbucks:( we even asked if we could have the managers card and none of the regular staff knew how to help us nor did they apologize! It took 20 minutes to get our drinks! First ordered in the drive thru then had to walk in.

I haven't been to this location in a couple of months. But, I didn't get the kind of Superior Starbucks Service that I'm accustomed to. The young lady seemed like I was disrupting her day by being there to order coffee. She didn't smile, greet me or even ask my name to put on my coffee cup as they normally would do although she didn't need to because it's on my Gold Starbucks card...hint hint I buy a lot of Starbucks Coffee. Despite all of that everyone else was great and so was my coffee!

I'm usually not in a good mood during my first few minutes there. ... But every morning, a couple co-workers and I make a trip to this Starbucks.  Its like 5 minutes away walking (it used to be on Adams and we went there, too). ...  ... Its always nice coming here.  There are 3 staff members that I know by name now (Jason, Johnny, and Brittney (SP)).  These guys are great.  Friendly, talkative, easy going, and down to earth.  I've gone to some starbucks and felt like I was really doing something wrong by coming in and ordering a beverage.  This location is so not that way.  Even when they get busy - they stay at the same coolness level. ...  ... Another thing that I really love here is the way they just hook a brother up - suggesting awesome drinks that I would never have thought to put together.  I've had some crazy delicious frappes thanks to these guys.  And before them, I never knew what a Black Eye was!  A lot of times I'll just say "make me something good", and they hook it up. ...  ... Besides the early morning crew, I've also had good experiences in the afternoon when its pretty darn busy.  Don't know any of their names though. ...  ... This place is such a requirement for my work day.  I need it.  Honestly.  Its not just the caffeine (I actually get decaf anyway)...its not just the familiarity of having a warm beverage in the morning.  Its coming here and seeing familiar faces and chewing the fat about the NBA, and having that personal touch, and stuff (and the cute cashier with a great smile that i don't know her name...).   ...  ... These folks are great here. ...  ... I don't know enough about what is good coffee and what is not to rate the coffee.  I mean, I drink the decaf with white chocolate and cinnamon dolce just about every morning...and I think it tastes good.  So yeah, I can't say their coffee or frappes are better or worse than anywhere else.

Next to the light rail station! Great customer service and theres outlets under the table hidden so cool!

REVIEW #3:  5 stars  (439 chars)
So happy I came here on a hot AZ day.  It's pretty hard to find if you are not familiar with the area.  Lots to eat near by so it's a convenient place to get your coffee or Iced beverage on.   ...  ... I got my usual- Green tea, w/soy latte.  I sometimes get the frap and it ALWAYS tastes so refreshing!  I want one now!!!  The ladies here are very friendly and work quick.  No complaints here. ...  ... I am sure I will be back very soon.

REVIEW #4:  5 stars  (207 chars)
Starbucks you are the wind beneath my wings.  I come here A LOT.  All the baristas are very helpful and kind.  This place has saved me numerous times from a stressful or sleepy day.  Long live the Americano.

REVIEW #5:  5 stars  (440 chars)
This location is one of my favorites, and while I have two others that are a little closer to my office, I make the effort to walk to this location.  The staff is amazingly friendly.  Also, they can really move customers through so that even with a long line you aren't stuck waiting for too long.  What makes this even better is that you still get that personal connection and friendliness that you hope for when you walk into a Starbucks.

REVIEW #6:  5 stars  (619 chars)
This Starbucks location is one of my favorites in Phoenix. The size of it is suitable for fairly large crowds - Comic Con was in town, and they had plenty of room for everyone that came. The baristas are super friendly and do their job very well - very professional. I spent a couple of hours there in between my meals and walk around the city. The drink I ordered was spot-on. The men's restroom was very clean (not sure about the women's... ha). There are plenty of outlets to plug in your electronic devices.  ...  ... Would I recommend this Starbucks location to others? Absolutely. Will I be back? Most definitely.

REVIEW #7:  5 stars  (205 chars)
What can I say....I love Starbucks!   This location had a very large in door seating area. It is also located in a great little square of shops, attractions and even fountains!  What more could you want :)

REVIEW #8:  4 stars  (1092 chars)
A good representation of "the Starbucks experience" with an air of sophistication, reasonable simulation of hardwood floors, free Wi-Fi, courteous, competent staff, expensive coffee, and the infamous PSL: Pumpkin Spice Latte, which Lord help me, at 300 calories for a small ("Tall" in Starbucks parlance), I love.  There are also some healthy food and snack box options, as well as some excellent if more-sweet/less healthy cakes and cookies, and all that I've tried have been quite good, quite consistent with the level of quality expected. ...  ... The cool, comfortable atmosphere is an inviting, consistent pleasure.  Inside and out, this SB  offers a great the view of the CityScape Plaza  for some great people watching, though the polite but persistent panhandling can be discouraging to sitting outside.  SB coffees are frequently too strong as well as too expensive for me to partake of on a regular basis, but I respect that they do provide health insurance benefits to their employees.  ...  ... To repeat, a good representation of the positive aspects of the Starbucks experience.

REVIEW #9:  4 stars  (213 chars)
Always polite at this Starbucks. They are not that quick but that's because there are just so many people coming through this place. Totally strange mix of people here too with lawyers in suits to homeless people.

REVIEW #13:  4 stars  (479 chars)
While in town for a meeting, I took the light rail down town to check out the scene. I stopped by this Starbucks bordering a bustling plaza. ...  ... Pros: Super friendly staff - interested in what brought me to town, but not in a creepy way. Also, ample seating - outdoors on the plaza, and plentiful seating inside, including large community tables and smaller standard tables. ...  ... I would definitely come here to get work done, hang out with friends or just people watch.

REVIEW #14:  4 stars  (821 chars)
Yay!! A Starbucks within reasonable walking distance to the office! This one is much nicer than the older one over on Adams. This Starbucks location is updated, bright and airy, and has some cool folks working in here. There's outside seating, and it's on the edge of a nice park with water works and even more outside seating.  The seating is a bit crowded, and they don't have the green stoppers out where we can grab one -- you have to ask the barista for one.  Either way, this location is great for a hot or cold drink, especially if you need a break from work or if you're walking around enjoying the nearby shopping.   ...  ... This Starbucks is on the SEC of Washington St and First Avenue.  From the street, it could be easy to miss; however, if you're walking, it's beside Jimmy John's and across from Chipotle.

REVIEW #15:  2 stars  (102 chars)
Baristas here are more interested in talking to each other than making an iced tea. 8 minutes? Really?

REVIEW #16:  2 stars  (234 chars)
Employees here are great, location is great. ...  ... Don't pick the white marble table in the corner(on the right when you walk in) it's broken and wobbles a lot. ...  ... Internet speed is horrible, speedtest.net got 1mbps/0.32 mpbs

I placed my order and got what I wanted.  That's fine.  But why was I bothered by the Barney Fife rent-a-cop?  He had the nerve to keep coming past me and after he asked a bunch of dumb questions.  Oh Maybe It's Because I Look A Certain Way...

Today I went to Starbucks for there BOGO free deal with my mom.  The lady at Starbucks was really nice.  I got my favorite peppermint mocha and my mom got eggnog latte.   ...  ...

I should say when we went to this Starbucks it was 5:30am, and none of us had more than 5 hours sleep the night before.  SO...that said...the person making the drinks was very nice, and got the order right.  I got a caramel macchiato, extra hot with low fat milk.  I added whipped cream....because I could. I am not a huge huge Starbucks fan, but at 5:30 this morning...it was the best Starbucks ever!  lol.  It is in a Safeway, so you can also pick up some groceries.

REVIEW #3:  4 stars  (182 chars)
Love this Starbucks. The employees are always friendly and get your drinks promptly. Because it is in a Safeway, they may not have everything a standalone would have but that's okay.

REVIEW #4:  1 stars  (1211 chars)
This is possibly one of the most ridiculous things that has ever occured to me in a "coffee shop".  This $tarbucks is located inside the Safeway at 7th Ave & Osborn.  I rarely ever patronize a Sbucks, but my grandmother was wanting some coffee, so I obliged.  Being the coffee snob I am, I opted for a tea.  Even bagged tea is better than corporate coffee in my eyes (even if it's by the same company). ...  ... I ordered an iced rooibos.  Tea.  Who can screw that up, right?  He made my grandmother's latte, which appeared "fine" (though one has to wonder) and proceeded onto my tea. ...  ... Plastic cup.  Adds ice.  Fills with water.  Adds tea bag.  Swirls the cup around and hands it to me.   ...  ... -- "Do you want a second tea bag or something?"  ... -- "Huh? What? Why would I need two tea bags?" ...  ... I stand there acting confused.  Did you expect ice water to create iced tea, or any tea at all?  I tell him he has to brew the tea, then dump it over ice.  He shoots back that he did *exactly* that.  I demand he remake it.  This time I told him to brew me the hot tea, give me a separate cup filled with ice, and I will deal with the tea steeping and such.  He does that, and I make my tea.  Ugh.

REVIEW #5:  1 stars  (322 chars)
What can really be said about starbucks that hasn't already? What seems to be 10 years ago awesome coffee has turned into todays "meh... ive had better." ...  ... This is the location inside the safeway. I usually stick to a tea, but if you're looking for coffee close to this area, try Lux on central about .5 miles away.

I go to this SB's every morning on my way to work. The staff all know me by name, scream good morning to me as I haul my sleepy ass in there every morning and they know what I want and make it fast.  My hat goes off to Misty, Thomas, Jade and all the others who get me in & out as fast as they can and with a smile.

REVIEW #3:  5 stars  (222 chars)
Loved the employees of this store.  I told them I need to get 2 drinks with the hospital, with food, and 2 bags, so they put my drinks in to a carrier and sealed my hot drink with green plug so it does not spill.  SWEET!!!

REVIEW #4:  4 stars  (198 chars)
I go every morning. Heston, MJ and Joel are the regular staff, and pretty much know us by name. It's the smallest, busiest Starbucks I've ever been to. Patience! They're working as fast as they can.

REVIEW #5:  4 stars  (215 chars)
One of the better chais I've had. The staff is friendly and quick. I was in and out in under 10 minutes. 4 stars because I believe in a drive thru Starbucks. I could see struggling to find parking here on the daily.

Same Ol' - Same Ol'  What did ya expect!   Still, if you want some caffeine, and you need it now, here's the place to juice up right before making that visit to Good Samaritan Hospital down the block to see a hurting bro or sista! ...  ... Located just on the north/west corner of 7 th and McDowell in a little strip mall of about four other businesses.  Next door to Einstein Bagels as their neighbor companion and moderate outside seating.  Indoor seating is slim at best and not much in the way for room.  Just a thin suite for the in&out feeling (Move it! Move it!)... ...  ... Let's try and get excited about this Starbucks!----???----Well, there is a Bus Stop for local transit just in front!----That should lift your grocery bags some---or at least your duffel bag.... ...  ... During the day I felt like ordering a double-shot instead of getting shot at!  That's a positive!  (not sure about night though?...)

REVIEW #8:  2 stars  (975 chars)
I'm done with this location. The drinks are the usual you'd get from any other Starbucks. However, beware if you aren't a regular. I stop by this location every few weeks if it's convenient to get a hot vanilla latte--nothing fancy. But they always manage to get the complicated, fancy drinks with a cup of sugar done well before mine, even when I'd been 2 people in line before them. Are these folks regulars? Maybe, but that's no reason to provide bad customer service to everyone else. Twice they'd completely forgotten my order. ...  ... These folks are also quick to call the cops on homeless people walking by or sitting outside reading the newspaper. Most other locations in central Phoenix don't seem to have a problem when homeless people sit near or in the cafes; in fact, I've seen baristas at other locations offer water, etc. So, if you're not into a place that criminalizes someone who hasn't done anything wrong, I wouldn't recommend patronizing this location.

REVIEW #9:  2 stars  (898 chars)
Ordered a drink here that I get at another location regularly. The other location told me there is a very specific way to ask for the drink, which will make the baristas job easier and I was told it was a company wide thing. So I tried to order it here the same way.... BIG mistake... The cashier, Heston was rude and seemed annoyed that I would be asking for the drink in such a way, he even told me to "get to the point". I admit, I was struggling to order it because I have completely forgotten what exactly to say but his attitude toward me was unnecessary! I apologized for "wasting" his time and he said, "next time just say what you want. We are busy and I don't have time for this song and dance!" Good. Grief! I have to mention... I was the ONLY one in the store at the time, so I am not too sure why he was in such a hurry... ...  ... I will not be coming back. I suggest you do the same!

REVIEW #10:  1 stars  (610 chars)
SInce when does a trip to Starbucks take 20 minutes. No, I didn't get a fancy frapuccino order for 5 people at work. Actually, I only one an iced coffee and a regular americano. No reason to take that long, unless the person in front of you ordered enough sugar-based drinks to give you a sugar high for a month. Oh and maybe the fact that there are only 2 people working there on a busy morning has something to do with that. Either way, I would rather go to any other place for coffee or skip it all together. This Starbucks made me late to work and I cannot believe they have such a low standard of service.

I have to say that even though I am not a huge Starbucks aficionado, coming here last night was pleasant..  After patronizing Starbucks in NYC and San Fran for 2 years each, its nice to finally be able to sit down and have a cup of coffee, without there being a 1,001 people in or out at all times, thus making it a very unpleasant experience.  The drive-thru was not busy and only 2 people were there with on laptops.  The employees at the counter were very nice, and we were chatting up a storm. Knowing that I will be able to come in here without a line during 5 p.m., is something of value to me. I would say I am glad to have this location in my neighborhood, and will be returning soon! Thanks guys!

I often go to this shop and I enjoy it.  It's a bit larger than usual so you can do work at the tables or relax in the large chairs.  The staff is friendly and by now they usually know my order.  Lots of parking and the drive-thru is fast. ...  ... One con is that the large chairs tend to have crumbs in them.  You have to do a brush down before you sit.

Dude, it's a Starbucks...just like the other one down the street from the other 4 just around the corner... ...  ... My one and only visit to this location (so far) was pleasant and I successfully ordered, acquired, mixed, and drank my Americano.  Mission accomplished.

REVIEW #11:  3 stars  (1346 chars)
We drive through here every Saturday  and Sunday on the way to dog park.  First off, I like Starbucks coffee, and the hearty rich punch of coffee flavor.  I like that Starbucks does an "Americano", which is probably their only "frou-frou" drink other than a  latte that exists in the non-Starbucks world.  I've found some independents don't do Americano's because they think it's too "Starbucks".  Go to France folks, "Americanos" all over.  So knowing that I like Starbucks, here's the scoop on this shop: ... 1) Service is inconsistent - sometimes courteous, quick and spot on (usually the Sunday AM lady who is currently out due to knee surgery), but sometimes they are slow and get the order all wacked up and forget things.  ... 2) the blender is near where the person taking the order often stands.  "I'd like a wrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.  A what? whrrrrrrrrrrrrr.... ... 3) Sometimes panhandlers hang our at the drive through.  Hasn't happened in the last month or so, but has occurred more than once.  We always notify the person at the window - don't know if they do anything about it ... 4) Inside is generally clean and neat ... 5) When I do go inside, I inevitably get stuck behind people who like to blab about themselves to the person behind the counter, other people in line, or someone on the cell.  Maybe that's  just a weird coincidence.

Booooo Booooo! I'm NOT a StarYucks patron. Really. I'm not. However some evil friend gave me a StarYucks gift card and of course I had to use it. So. I tried. I don't do the half caf, part skim, part whole, chai, with light chocolate sprinkles venti grande tallie or whatever. I truly  hate those people. But I did request a soy latte. They were out of soy. Hmmm...Ok. I run a restaurant, I understand running out of products. Next day, same StarYucks. Same drive thru. Same monster in the window. Soy Latte please. Sorry, no soy milk. Oh for crap sake. This StarYucks is 200 yards from a grocery store. That sells soy and other market goods. So I peeled out, went to Lux, and my world was at peace. Once again.

Baristas here are rude! Try to avoid this Starbucks as much as possible. When my dad ordered his drink with his accent the barista (Hanna) at the drive through made fun of him! How insulting. When it was my turn to place my order I made sure to share with Hanna a couple of customer service tips. She was so embarrassed she had someone else give us our drinks. I wish I would have had the chance to talk to the manager about her behavior, but honestly I had more important things to do. Also, on Sunday when I went through the drive through they quickly told me what my total was without asking if there was anything else that I needed. "I am not done yet! " and then the guy laughed. Apparently everything you tell them is a joke. Also, last month they were out of venti cups..... I personally love Starbucks, but when it comes to customer service one bad experience it's all it takes to  lose the loyalty.

REVIEW #15:  1 stars  (307 chars)
I spend a lot of money each month on my iced coffees and I love Starbucks, but this location gets my drink wrong EVERY time I go there. The reason I continue to go to this Starbucks location is because it is so close to my work and I only get a 30 minute lunch. I wish they could get their service in check!

I try to support local coffee shops in general (grow your local economy, folks!), but Starbucks' vanilla rooibos, when served over ice, just cannot be beat.  So I frequent Starbucks too! ...  ... Not. This. One. ...  ... For some reason, this location just cannot handle serving this brewed tea iced.  It is literally the only location that I've ever been to that flat out refuses to do it (on three separate occasions, by three separate baristas).  I give up!

REVIEW #17:  1 stars  (1179 chars)
So today was the last straw.  I am a new customer to Starbucks and have visited this store on several occasions and for the most part the employees have been efficient but very grumpy.  I have on two occasions in the past month spoken to the manager about it - I think his name is John - about the grumpy people that work there.  On the phone he promised me a free drink the next time I was in (which he conveniently forgot when I asked him about it). ...  ... The first few times I was in I was waited on by a young lady who never smiled (actually it was more of a scowl) and when I interacted with her she was blank faced and sour in her reactions.  This was the person I spoke to the manager about.   ...  ... Today I was served by a young lady who basically threw my drink at me (energetically) and when I asked for extra ice she scowled at me.  Never said thanks, smiled or offered any pleasantries. ...  ... Basically the service in that store s*&ks.  I have been in there multiple times and have never really gotten anything close to what I would call happy service. ...  ... Thought you should know.  Unfortunately I will not be going into that store again. ...  ... Greg

REVIEW #18:  1 stars  (636 chars)
Terrible! Today was the 4th, yes 4th time they have messed up my order. 1st, they forgot my sandwich, 2nd they sent my sandwich to the drive thru, 3rd they sent my iced coffee to the drive thru, and a day later (!) They forgot to make my coffee altogether. Mind you, the last time I was the ONLY person in line. How is that even possible. I can't tell you how many free drinks I've gotten out of this location. These most recent 4 issues are just in the past month. There are many more I could go in to, but I don't have the time or energy to start. If you can put up with the service, then I would say go there to just get free drinks!

I usually wouldn't write a review for a Starbucks, but this one is special.  ...  ... Located in the Old School plaza on the corner of 7th Street and Osborn, this is one of the most well designed Stabucks I have seen.

This Is a New Store So Obviously It's Not Going To Be Perfect at First... Either Way No Place/Restaurant/Business Is Completely Perfect...  ...  ... First Off, If you want to Ensure Your Order Is Correct Make Sure The Barista has your Order Correct and Don't Just Drive Up to the Window without Verifying Anything Because That Is More Likely to allow your order to be taken wrong. ... Please Do Your Best Not To Order Additional Items AT The Window Because It Will Only Take Longer And Consequently Will Make Any People In Line Behind You Wait Longer... So Please Avoid Ordering at the Window... ...  ...  Also, Starbucks Is NOT Meant To be A Super Fast Drive Through Place As It Is Not Just Any Random Fast Food Place... It Is Meant To Be A High-Quality Welcoming Coffee Shop... So Do Not Be Surprised If The Wait Is a Little Too Long.. Especially If you saw a Long Line But decided To Go Anyways... In The End Your Nonfat Pumpkin Spice Latte Should Be Worth It... And If It's Not... The Person at the Window is Not to Blame... And Starbucks can Afford one less customer... Or two.. Nevertheless Patience Is a Virtue...  ...  ... If you follow Through With These Tips, Your Starbucks Experience Should (And Will Most Likely Be) Great!

I really like the layout of this new Starbucks and the building is pretty cool too.  Normally the services at Starbucks are pretty great.  But this time around we did not have a really good experience.  The guys that check us out were nice and friendly.  When we were waiting to pick up our coffee, we waited more than 10 minutes and we only had a couple of people ahead of us.  Also they make my mom's coffee wrong.   ...  ... Since I really like Starbucks I will give this store another shot.

I visited the establishment on Friday 11/15 in the afternoon. ...  ... I give this place 3 stars for the following reasons: ...  ... 1.  Service was on the slow side at the registers (4 people in one line, 1 cashier - possible staffing issues). ...  ... 2.  The wi-fi is PAINSTAKINGLY SLOW!! (with only 3-4 people present in dining area).  Internet speeds clocked in at less than 1Mbps at times.. never better than 1.5 Mbps (could hardly read emails, browse websites - and yes same experience on laptop, tablet device as well as phone).

There is a pint-sized area inside (4-5 tables) and a larger outdoor patio if you wish to relax with your beverage and pirate some wifi. ...  ... Employees here were prompt and pleasant. Overall, a fairly typical Starbucks.

REVIEW #13:  1 stars  (176 chars)
7 minutes to get an iced tea. I was inside and there was no one in front of me.  I rarely come to this location because it always takes this long whether its peak times or not.

REVIEW #14:  1 stars  (367 chars)
Been to many Starbucks and this place is by far the worst. Staff are absolutely rude and unhelpful. How can there be absolutely no sugar or sweetener at 10am during a weekday? Unacceptable! And when I asked about it just got a snippy sorry? Never again, go to park central a few blocks over instead. This town needs a real coffee place instead of this corporate crap.

REVIEW #17:  1 stars  (236 chars)
I like this one, nice people, nice atmosphere, great location, I just for the life of me can't figure why whether in drive thru or in store, the service is sooooo slow and they often get drinks wrong! Not sure where the blame should go!

REVIEW #18:  1 stars  (1188 chars)
I rarely leave negative reviews.. but this is consistently the worst service out of any Starbucks I've been to - EVER. Unfortunately I go here because it is close to my house and I love starbucks iced coffee... But almost ALL the employees are always completely out of it, slow, not eager to help, and constantly make mistakes because thy aren't listening/don't care. It's so weird - I actually really think Starbucks manager and corporate staff would not be happy. Normally I love starbucks but this is more like an overstaffed-yet-super-slow store pretending to be starbucks. It's not fast or efficient like the brand is known for. It's like everyone hired here are high school dropouts with no desire to do anything. It's bad service EVERYTIME and the drive thru line is always really slow because the chick they always have it makes so many mistakes. Also- they never have the creamer out on the weekend mornings and it's like pulling teeth trying to get their attention to ask for it. All I get is a black iced coffee, and it ALWAYS takes at LEAST 10 minutes.... on the weekends after 10am. Not their busiest time. The line is just long because all the workers are alway so confused.

REVIEW #19:  1 stars  (119 chars)
Slowest Starbucks ever! Going on 15min for vanilla latte. 15min may not sound long, but for a drink, on a slow morning.

REVIEW #20:  1 stars  (279 chars)
Slowest Starbucks in Phoenix. Whether I'm the only car in the drive thru, in a line through the parking lot (often), or waiting inside, they have never been faster than a 10 min wait time. ...  ... If you find yourself on the corner of Osborn and 7th, keep driving. Not worth it.

REVIEW #21:  1 stars  (714 chars)
This Starbucks is never open at 5am when I try to stop by.  One morning I wasn't in a rush so I patiently waited for them to get their stuff together.  A half hour later I finally got my coffee.  I don't always have that luxury. ...  ... This morning, the interior lights were on but there was an employee standing outside, knocking on the door, to have no one open it for him.  The drive thru board was off as I drove through irritated that once again they were not open.  This was at 5:10am.  Every time I visit the store first thing in the morning they have not been open.  ...  ... I don't plan on visiting this store again.  It's obvious there's a trend with the employees that they can't get to work on time.

REVIEW #22:  1 stars  (511 chars)
This Starbucks single-handedly caused me to swear off all Starbucks as my new years resolution. Every time I visited this location they were beyond slow, and have a tendency to mess up my order. I ordered a soy latte and got severely burnt regular milk. It's slower to go inside and be one of two customers than to be at the back of a 10 car line up in the drive thru. I only went here because I was in a hurry- the one things Starbucks is usually best at. I live across the street and will never go here again.

Never a bad experience at Starbucks.  I am here with my dog, Molly.  Being respectful of the premises I did not bring Molly into the store. I called the store and spoke to Terry who took my order and brought it out to me. She even brought Molly a cup of water...a nice touch!

REVIEW #5:  5 stars  (416 chars)
This is my - on the way to work - Starbucks and I must say, the staff are always polite, efficient and friendly. My very early mornings at work are always made much more pleasant. I've been to roughly 1 million of the 10 million Starbucks in this nation, and customer service is apparently optional. This store is the exception. Take the extra trip to come here. ( just please do so after 8am so there's no line ) :)

REVIEW #8:  4 stars  (761 chars)
This Sarbucks is right next to my work so I am here 3-4 times a week (at least!) One thing I really like is their large patio equipped with a misting system.  The majority of the tables are under the roof awning so it's a great place to relax with your coffee and utilize their free WiFi or go old school and read the paper. If your lucky you might even see one of their regulars; a gentleman who sits outside with his toucan on his shoulder! Scared the bejesus out of me first time I walked past him... ... Inside the baristas are friendly and efficient and have no problem making custom offers. They also regularly have samples of new drinks and/or food items out for customers to sample. There is also adequate seating inside if you can't deal with the heat!

REVIEW #11:  2 stars  (440 chars)
Just like the rating. Meh. ... Baristas look like they are bored out of their minds. ... My friend wanted to inquire about their free Tall Hazelnut macchiato, and boy were they sour about it. They decide to honor the promotion, like they should, and gave my friend her free drink. I bought a venti sized, and was given what? Caramel macchiato. ... Disappointed for sure, and I won't be coming back, mainly cuz I live in Southern California.

REVIEW #12:  1 stars  (278 chars)
Don't get coffee here. One staff person isn't clean.    There's a grungy looking bearded guy with Mohawk that works on weekends, saw adjust his underwear from the crack of his a$$ and did not wash his hands. He reached in far, ish was nasty yo. . Also, slow wifi and no outlets.

It's my fav starbuck cuz it's across the street form my house. It taunts me daily. Pavlovian response make my mouth water for a white mocha nonfat no whip everytime. The people who work there remember the regulars and offer suggestions and even help you save money by working the angles to get you the combination special price.  Also a good place for people watching or picking up a little something on the way to the light rail or antiquing up 7th Ave.

REVIEW #7:  5 stars  (349 chars)
This place is pretty much everything I'm looking for from a Starbucks.  Good, standard drinks.  Very friendly staff who remember my name and my order.  Always clean and definitely one of the busier Starbucks locations in the Valley.  Parking in the relatively small attached lot can be tricky at times because they share it w/ a Pei Wei and Sidebar.

REVIEW #8:  5 stars  (586 chars)
This store is brand new,  just opened this past Sunday!!  It is right on the edge of the F Q Story historical district.   ...  ... The store has a more traditional coffee house feel than other Starbucks have.  With the exposed red brick and the open cubbies for storing the syrups, cups and saucers it, the store really says "Come in and stay awhile".   There's is a nice sitting area with two home style chairs and a chaise lounge. ...  ... The patio is inviting with a quite grassy area and many trees.  In just a few months, this is going to be the place to hang out and enjoy life!!

REVIEW #9:  4 stars  (655 chars)
A cute Starbucks that still has some character despite the corporate attempt to make it just like every other. The wall where the seats are (along the window) is still solid brick, so there is no way to put a power outlet. Instead, they have the power outlets in the ceiling, so your cord gets to dangle. Odd, but charming. And when you're looking up and stretching to get the power adapter into the jack, note the wood rafters and unfinished ceiling hiding up there. ...  ... They also have some umbrella covered tables outside. ...  ... Wi-fi worked great. ...  ... Tip: This is an "interesting" neighborhood. Watch your surroundings in the parking lot.

REVIEW #10:  4 stars  (366 chars)
I usually prefer giving my money to local venues, however, this is my FAVORITE Starbucks. ...  ... The baristas are always in a great mood and smiling. They also make an effort to remember their customers, which is difficult to do in such a large city. ...  ... The only downfall is the fact they share parking with Pei Wei, often making it difficult to find a spot.

REVIEW #11:  4 stars  (405 chars)
I'm a fan of Starbucks fan, so I'm biased.  But this is what I like about this store (because they aren't all the same). ...  ... I love the building.  I kind of wish that all cafes had this version of interior design (and even the Starbucks theme works here). ...  ... The staff is so darn nice.  They help start my day with a real smile and a kind word. ...  ... The coffee and food is relable and good.

REVIEW #12:  4 stars  (244 chars)
Love Starbucks)))) The place is nice, the service is great and it's walking distance from my place.  The only thing I don't like - sometimes they don't have my fav pecan tart. That's the only desert I'm enjoying.  They should have it always))))

REVIEW #13:  4 stars  (1073 chars)
Situated next to a Pei Wei Chinese restaurant on the southwest corner of 7th ave and McDowell, this starbucks seems to have a classy crowd probably due to the reviews here on Yelp. There are 10-20 seating places outside with plenty of umbrellas and inside they keep the a/c at a pleasant 75F. Vaulted exposed wood rafters and modern industrial large ac ducting give this and outdoorsy feel without being garrish.  All the servers were polite and fast and I even tested them by paying in quarters for the hell of it.  Plenty of fresh looking food available and the wifi connection speed is the standard 1.4Megabit DL and 1.2 Megabit upload (Divide Mbit by 8 to get actual MB) Ping was 62ms.  5 or so tables inside and 4 comfy victorian-esque seats available for those who want to enjoy wifi or a good read, with side tables, lamps, and plenty of power outlets.  My Chai Latte was manifico, Pros: Indoor Outdoor Seating, upgraded seating, Snacks Coffee Tea, Power outlets, AC, Friendly Staff, Clean, Fast, etc.. Cons: it may be hard to find a seat, due to its popularity now.

REVIEW #14:  4 stars  (679 chars)
The only way this Starbucks could be any more convenient for me would be to add a drive thru! It is situated right off the 10 (just a short 2 minute drive from my house), so I can swing by first thing in the morning before I get on the freeway to head to work. It's a smaller store but most people that come through here don't hang out, they are the "grab your coffee and go" types. However there is a really nice patio outside if you choose to enjoy your drink there.  ...  ... The employees here are always super friendly, relaxed, and quick with your order, even when the line is to the door! Out of all the Starbucks in the downtown area, this will always be my first choice!

This 'bucks is right down the street from my house, so whenever I get a caffeine fix, I take a little walk to my local Starbucks. It does suck that this, Pei Wei and SideBar took over the fierce Emerald Lounge, but business is business.  ... Anyway, in no time at all the staff knew my name and my drink. Does that mean I go there too much or they're just that good? I vote for the latter, and on top of it these guys know the right way to make my drink. I've tried to explain my drink to other baristas in other stores from Phoenix to LA to Vegas to San Francisco (jeez I visit Starbucks too much), and they never get it quite right.  ... Also the place is usually spotless, even when it's crowded, which makes for a great hang out spot.

This is a great Starbucks because I found it early on a Saturday morning when I was passing through town really really jonesing for some of my coffee. I was so relieved I wasn't even upset for having 2 people in line ahead of me. I got my mocha with a minimum of drama, always a plus. The server was pleasant and perky, even smiling. Much better than the Circle K worker across the street. He was a sourpuss. Starbucks had cleaner bathrooms too.  ...  ... I got my gas from sourpuss and my coffee from perky smiles. Back on the road in less than 20 minutes.  ...  ... Directions: Take the 7th Avenue North exit off of I-10. a few blocks north to the corner of W. McDowell Ave. It is on the southwest  corner of 7th and McDowell.

REVIEW #18:  3 stars  (1013 chars)
I am visiting Phoenix for the first time this week, and I like to have familiar along with all the strange of being here newly. I have not traveled much abroad, so I can imagine it being orders of magnitude more difficult if it was in a country with a foreign language.  ...  ... So seeing a Starbucks was a relief. Say what you will, but coming home in a different neighborhood is a good thing. You can say that SBUX is a home away from home. I am sure hotels try to do the same thing, to remain unique, but familiar enough so you can relax better.  ...  ... Came in on Monday morning and ordered 2 Americanos. Nothing special. Got my coffee and drove away. There is no drive through, and they share the building with a Chinese-themed restaurant named Pei Wei Asian Diner. In looking for this Starbucks, I discovered that  Pei Wei is a subsidiary of P. F. Chang's. Now you know.  ...  ... The SBUX was clean, not crowded at 10 in the morning. Service had  to be good because I was the only customer in the store.

REVIEW #19:  3 stars  (791 chars)
I like this Charbucks a lot. I just wish they served non starbucks coffee :) ...  ... It's right on a busy corner, but there are steel bollards to prevent drunk drivers from crashing into and killing the folks sitting on the patio.  ...  ... It's right off the freeway, so I have a lot of business meetings there when I'm working at home - other people can get to it easily from nearby areas.  ...  ... It's grassy outside and there is comfortable seating.  ...  ... Inside this starbucks, it's all exposed brick and duct work. Very urban cool. ...  ... I hate that Starbucks charges for WIFI. I never use it - it's not worth it. I get Internet over my phone, anyway. ...  ... There aren't a lot of coffee options right in this area, so this is pretty much it for me when I need a cuppa joe.

REVIEW #21:  3 stars  (497 chars)
It's not the friendliest staff that works here at night. I went in once and was really impressed with the building and the remodel they did, but the two girls working that night ignored me for the most part. What really pissed me off was the girl who made my drink walked away before ringing it up to get someone else to ring it up for me. No problem I understand she is probably logged into the cashier, but she sure as hell took her sweet time finishing stocking the fridge before she helped me.

REVIEW #22:  3 stars  (303 chars)
Starbucks is Starbucks, but their service is a big part of why I paid $3 for an iced tea rather than wait in line across the street at McDonalds. Unfortunatly, they fell shortthis time and I even got a grimace when asking for extra ice for me tea. It's 110 out, ice is nice - especially for that $3 tea.

REVIEW #23:  2 stars  (1062 chars)
My previous experience at this location was great. My experience tonight was anything but great. It took the barista five minutes to even come out from the back room. Then she was rude when she took my order. She wouldn't even talk directly to me except to ask me what size I wanted. She was too busy talking to her co-worker and friends that had come to visit. I watched for my drink after I ordered it, but it took a few minutes being that there was a lady ahead of me. I was getting my stuff around for a minute and she didn't even call out my drink - she just left it sitting on the counter. I mix it up and take a sip of it, ready to ignore all of that, only to have my tastebuds be overcome by all the extra flavor in the drink. I got a venti caramel crunch frappe and could only drink a fourth of it, because it tasted like I took a bottle of syrup and drank it. ...  ... I say all of that to say that it was the baristas working that made this experience a bad one. I still very much like this location, but I will have to watch for some decent baristas.

Probably won't be going back to this Starback... I ordered the green tea frapp and Chicken Bacon Swiss sandwich... Waited 10 minutes to be told that they were out of the ingredients for the sandwich. :-(   The guy exits to the side after relaying this bit of news to me. I sit.., as I am waiting to get a refund. Guy returns only to start taking orders. I go back up to the counter and inquired about the refund. Guy states, "oh, we have it." Uuuh!  ...  ... I get the $6 sandwich and literary there are two cubes of chicken and two shriveled up slices of bacon on a half toasted bun. Geez! ...  ... Seating is limited. The store is very tight. ...  ... Good thing that the green tea frapp had it going on or this review would be one star!

Great Starbucks whether you go through the drive thru or inside. I stop by every morning (drive thru). Service is quick and the employees are all really nice.

REVIEW #3:  5 stars  (879 chars)
So there is a Starbucks on every corner but each has it's own unique look and customer service. This was my first visit to this new location. I like the buidling structure. It is quite unique compared to most Starbucks locations that are not attached to other shopping centers. It has this appeal when you walk in that is cozy. very trendy and upbeat but still that relaxing coffee shop we know Startbucks for. The team was mighty friendly. Properly staffed for the amount of traffic I can imagine to walk through the doors. Even though I did not walk in during rush hour there was still plenty of patrons who were meeting or dining.  ...  ... Greeted by the friendly team on staff for the day. My drink was properly made and served with a smile.  ...  ... This location is much larger than traditional Starbucks. Plenty of room to meet a small group inside or outside the venue.

REVIEW #4:  4 stars  (1000 chars)
The upside of this Starbucks is that it has one of the world's biggest patios. Seriously. It's an enormous wrap-around patio.....like something you'd see on a southern Victorian-style home.....oooohhhh now I'm craving fried chicken.....I digress. ...  ... So yeah, they have a pretty bad patio. I mean bad in the Micheal Jackson sense, not in the textbook definition. It's even full of misters to keep it cool. It's still a bit toasty to sit out there in the summer though. ...  ... What I don't understand about this laptop-dwellers' paradise is that they have such limited seating indoors. Seriously. Half of the restaurant is empty floor space. Why not jam pack it full of tables and chairs? Back east, that floor space is top dollar....tables are so squeezed into spaces, you sneeze and you hit the guy three tables over.  ...  ... Needless to say, you'll need to get there early to claim your spot if you want to sit indoors. Or you can brave the elements and sit outside. More tables out there.

REVIEW #5:  3 stars  (298 chars)
Staff is great, product is great, poor location. You will be harassed by homeless people and pedestrians if you sit on the patio. It is right next to one of the busiest light rail stops. Constant panhandlers if you are on the patio, no joke. After I had 5 in 10 minutes once, I stopped going there.

REVIEW #6:  3 stars  (744 chars)
There have been 2 or 3 restaurants in this location over the past 10 years or so and I think that Starbucks hit the nail on the head by taking over this location.  The patio is awesome!  Great for people watching (trust me, there are a lot of people to be watched from the light rail, to the queens over at Charlie's).  My biggest gripe.  The staff seem so discombobulated with their service.  They always seem to be going in neutral.  I have personally had to wait 10 minutes for an iced coffee which is already brewed and I avoid the drive thru at all cost.  I am not a fan of drive thru's at any type of restaurant.  Overall, this is a great location and I will continue to be a regular but please, get the customer service kinks ironed out.

REVIEW #7:  3 stars  (1053 chars)
Update: they're getting better.  I got an iced coffee for a day of errands.  Although I still prefer to frequent local joints, this was cold and refreshing.  The service has also improved. ...  ...  ... I have gone against my better judgement today by going through the drive thru at the new Starbucks by my house.   I try to support local businesses and want to commend SB for retrofitting  an old restaurant BUT have some reservations about their ability to be successful based on the service I received.  I pulled in behind one car at 3pm on a Saturday and there were at least 5 employees inside with a couple of customers waiting at the counter.  I waited 9 minutes at the window after having to repeat my order twice and when I got it home, it was wrong.  It was a skinny hazelnut and a lemon loaf, NOT rocket science! To top things off, the guy waiting on me said HE had to make my coffee.    What is that supposed to mean?! I know your staff is new and are working out the kinks but I expect more from you.  It's not like you have no competition.

REVIEW #8:  2 stars  (841 chars)
I was delighted when I found out this Starbucks location was opening. I work down the street so I thought this would become a regular stop for me on my morning commute. ...  ... The employees of this location have all been very nice and welcoming, however, the morning crew really needs a stronger manager to be working with them. I stopped frequenting this location because of the snail like pace of the service. No matter if I go through the drive thru or walk into the store the team can never complete my order in a timely manner. ...  ... The order I am having trouble with consists of a medium coffee and a breakfast sandwich. Obviously the coffee is given to me immediately, but the breakfast sandwich has always taken at least 15 minutes to get to me and usually cold. Somehow my order always seems to get lost amongst the employees.

This is a great little Starbucks.  The fact that they have a drive thru alone puts them at the maximum alloted stars.  But, the people that work here have always been friendly.  When I used to live a few blocks away I went here a couple times a day.  I was just back in town for a few days and came here everyday and they are still holding strong with their customer service.  If you live in this part of Glendale, you probably know that not too many places have employees who smile or seem happy but this Starbucks has hired some good people it seems.  Definitely worth the drive if it's a little out of your way.

For a company as large as they are, they sure do know how to do things right.  I don't often take out a loan to get coffee, but when I do, I make it a Starbucks.

Generally good service (a few baristas aren't as friendly as others). Drive thru is almost always quicker than going inside, despite how long the drive thru line may be. Drinks are consistent, which is important- some Starbucks tend to be inconsistent. When they do make the rare mistake, they own up to it and fix it.

You can never go wrong at a Starbucks for coffee and a quiet chill place for studying or anything really. Just a tip, once you get here and you see any availing tables or chairs grab it. They go fast here because this is a smaller coffee shop. Other than that, as always great staff and great enviroment.

REVIEW #12:  3 stars  (377 chars)
Just disappointed in there prepared foods as quality has dropped significantly lately. I understand baristas are rushed and don't expect perfection everytime but the protein boxes and salads have been wilted lately, have had old fruit, missing salt for my egg and only 7 grapes this time. I just think the price is absurd for the tiniest quantity of food to be of poor quality.

REVIEW #14:  2 stars  (810 chars)
Sitting at this Starbucks right now and am witnessing the same rude customer service I just received.  I walked in and was not greeted except with "I will be right with you".....  I wait a minute or two and am greeted again with same response.  The barista was just standing there punching in numbers and complaining about cups or something.  Then when I finally ordered, I felt as if I was inconveniencing her.  Before my order was completed she was helping the person behind me.  Asked if they wanted their regular.  Let me repeat, my order was not completed!  Then he gets his order way before I got mine.  Just frustrating to say the least.  I really like the location of this but just awful service today.  Awful.  Seems like this barrista picks and chooses who she wants to be friendly to.  End Rant.  :)

REVIEW #15:  2 stars  (389 chars)
The baristas were nice enough but the service was incredibly slow.  There was no line when I came in but apparently there were at least 2 or 3 orders ahead of me ... and they didn't start serving the first one ahead of me until 2 minutes of waiting.  I got the chocolate chip blended drink and it was really icy ... I've had the drink before and it's usually creamier.  Very disappointing.

REVIEW #16:  2 stars  (230 chars)
The drive through barista has been a bit surley when I have visited there.  Today the credit card receipt blew out their window and the barista only said "lovely" and stomped away as if it was my fault?  They seemed a little rude.

Stopped in to get some boiling water so I could heat up the pasta I brought from home (airport food is usually expensive & not that great), p/u a Very Berry Hibiscus (yum!), & make good use of the airport's free WiFi & ample wall plugs (and seating) in Starbucks. Fortunately, it didn't have that stinky coffee smell (I hate that) & it was extremely quiet for a Starbucks. ...  ... Susan was my cashier & she was very personable. She teased me for thinking that my request for hot water was silly. LOL I only ordered a Very Berry Hibiscus, but she's a great salesperson because she asked if I wanted to get a larger beverage or purchase any pastries. I didn't order anything else because I brought my own pasta & chips and wanted to grab a cocktail before my flight. Like a typical Starbucks, the line never seemed to end and the lady who was making the drinks was super quick! Her strategy was to ask people in line what they ordered before they paid and helped to keep the line moving along nicely.  ...  ... *Confession: Every time a plane takes off or lands, the entire room shakes slightly & that's not the easiest thing to get use to since I'm from California & it seemed like we kept having mini earthquakes.* ...  ... Unfortunately, I was unable to obtain internet access in Starbucks (and I wanted a cocktail) so I moved closer to my terminal after I ate. Other than having technical difficulties (WiFi may only be available in the terminals), I'd highly recommend this Starbucks when you're stuck in the Southwest terminal waiting for a flight. The customer service is excellent, the place doesn't smell like coffee (the smell makes me nauseous), there's plenty of seating and wall plugs, and even if there's a line, you get in & out quickly!

This is a quiet Starbuck's in an airport! Wow....didn't think this could exist? Well now that I blab about it on Yelp!, it may become slightly busier. It's situated in an odd location at the end of a usually broken moving sidewalk connecting the C and D concourses within Terminal 4. (Southwest).  ...  ...

This is just outside C security check point to the right. If I hadn't been actively looking for it (believe me, that chai was gonna happen) I might have missed it.  ... It's one of the newer Starbucks at Sky Harbor & I love that they made it more like an actual cafe, with plenty of seating.  ... Granted, even though the person who took my order wrote my name on my cup, the person who made it did not call it out, instead they said the type of drink..... a woman grabbed my drink (& so did I) & although I tried reasoning with her & telling her my name was on the cup, she insisted it was hers.... people who are caffeine deprived are scary, but fortunately in this location, you know they are not armed, LOL!. The Barista had to step in, pry her fingers off my cup & tell her that hers was coming up. The airport is always an adventure! :)

Good Mocha for a Branded Coffee Stop ...  ... SITREP ...  ... The metrics for coffee are pretty standard from Starbucks to Starbucks.  So that a Mocha I grab at the first Starbucks in Seattle is going to taste about the same as the one in my hometown of Sacramento to the one here in Phoenix.  And in the end, the taste of my mocha is the driving factor behind an overall rating. ...  ... Where "The rubber meets the road", so to speak, is in the execution of customer service.  Here, this Starbucks pretty much fails that measurement.  ...  ... THE SETUP ...  ... You're in an airport.  That should be the first clue to any establishment that it's going to be busy.  When I was here, it was EXTREMELY busy.  And yet, when you have a line about 12-16 people deep, waiting to (hopefully) grab a coffee and decompress, you are going to need more than ONE barista manning both the register AND the coffee machines, and making us wait about 20 minutes to get the coffee. ...  ... Minus 1-Star right there. ...  ... COST ...  ... Why is it that airports and businesses at airports somehow justify the idea that charging MORE for services and product at airports can be supported?   ...  ... I.  DON'T.  CARE.  ...  ... The fact airport establishments jack up their prices is a completely reviewable metric and one I will ALWAYS denigrate.  You can give me any excuse you want that the reason my cup of mocha here is a full $1.10 more here in Phoenix than at home, I won't ever accept your airport tax rationalization. ...  ... Minus another Star right there. ...  ... THE LOWDOWN ...  ... Great coffee.  But get more staff.  And f*ck airport taxes.

I was here in the early morning coming from a flight from San Antonio for a connecting flight to Long Beach Ca. and I needed a soothing frappe, plus a mild jolt after those dosing naps. Well I've ordered the Coconut Mocha frappe, which was was okay, I should've asked for extra blended because it got kinda icy and couldn't taste much of the mocha. ...  ... This guys were prepared early, four people working in the morning? thats great! no long lines, and I got my order within minutes.  ...  ... Afterwards I sat at the terminal and took a picture with my Coconut Mocha frappe on hand with a beautiful Phoenix sunrise.

There are at least four Starbucks in this airport - this is the one in T4 just inside Security Checkpoint C by gates C1-C10. ...  ... A surprisingly nice airport Starbucks. When I was there, it was quiet without a line. There is a seating area with four tables and three sets of four armchairs. You could actually sit here and believe that you were at any Starbucks, not inside an airport. ...  ... The place was well staffed (I believe there were three employees), and my drinks came quickly. They had bananas when I was there, which was nice, plus a limited assortment of baked goods (it was later in the day).

Stopped in the one by the C security checkpoint in between flights.  It was very busy, quite a long line.  My drink was fine, but the fruit and cheese thing I bought turned out to be growing fuzzy mold.  Would not stop here again.

REVIEW #28:  2 stars  (376 chars)
There are two other Starbucks in the airport, don't go to this one the line is too long. One is in baggage claim and the other is just before you go through security ...  ... In addition, while I rarely get food at Starbuck's I was excited to see vegetable frittata on the menu at this locale. Sadly, there were no detectable veggies in said frittata. ...  Most disappointing.

REVIEW #29:  2 stars  (368 chars)
This is what you would expect from an airport Starbucks. If you have time and are waiting for boarding I'd say it might be worth waiting in line. They definitely were understaffed for the crazy morning crowed. We probably waited almost half an hour and at the end I didn't get what I had actually asked for. I definitely have experienced better, and hence the 2 stars.

REVIEW #31:  1 stars  (406 chars)
Pike's Place was the only thing on brew. ... They would not consider making something else and instead suggested a "specialty coffee."   ... I explained to them that I desired neither the flavor, calories, or price of a "specialty" coffee - all I wanted was a coffee that didn't suck. ...  ... They could not provide a coffee that didn't suck and they had the audacity to act like this was somehow logical.

Probably the worst bagel I've ever eaten... granted, I should know better for ordering a bagel at an airport Starbucks, however I was starving, I was super late to my gate, and it was right in front of it.  I'll wait for peanuts next time.

REVIEW #33:  1 stars  (320 chars)
Went to the store in terminal A, service was not very good. Manager was talking loudly on cell phone while not doing anything. They wouldn't fill my travel mug and had to waste an additional paper cup to keep my hand from getting hot while pouring the coffee into my cup. Not impressed, not what I expect from Starbucks.

Giving this Starbucks 4 stars because of the customer service of the morning staff only. Been to this location at other times of the day and nothing compared to the morning staff. They are very friendly and do their best to great everyone with a smile. They actually take into account people are flying. I do agree with other reviews of the pastries. They suck and they are never that fresh but they also aren't the same pastries you find in the stand-alone Starbucks.

REVIEW #2:  4 stars  (399 chars)
This airport Starbucks is really nice and open. There's plenty of seating and there's several key tables located near posts with A/C for charging the phone/laptop or blow-drying one's hair.  ...  ... Service at this Starbucks is quick and because the atrium-based Starbucks is prior to TSA, it far less busy than the small, old dirty location just past the TSA. ...  ... Great job and funny barista!

REVIEW #3:  3 stars  (647 chars)
Great tasting half-caf.  But, the service was a bit slow for me.  I don't normally come to an airport with a lot of time to spare, so pulling up to the starbucks and getting my coffee in less than 5 minutes would be appreciated.  Nevertheless, I had time to spare, so the long line and wait wasn't much of a problem this time.  I think that perhaps they were caught off guard by the crowd on this day.   ...  ... One thing I've noticed is that Starbucks franchise service is not as good as the service one received in the Starbucks stores that are owned by Starbucks.  Oh well, grab your coffee and drink up then pull up your laptop and charge up!

REVIEW #4:  2 stars  (320 chars)
Really manager, you want to argue with me when I was given clearly a days-old croissant and thought you should know?!  Not even worth arguing.  ...  ... Extra star is because they gave me a small glass of water with no hassle. I actually wanted to buy their bottled water but it was room temperature for whatever reason.

Great customer service. This place is always busy no matter what time of day it is, but the staff are quick and you will get your coffee!!! (Remember, it's inside a hospital with nurses and doctors who have worked for hours on end). Only thing is if you got a gold card, yes, it works and you can get your refills, but you can't redeem your free drink, they just don't have the technology yet.

I come through St. Joes on a daily basis and in spite of consistent lines they manage to get my Chai to me in the same amount of time as less busy locations. So far this location is the only one that consistently gets my order right as well. Apparently Starbucks baristas have trouble understanding the phrase "whole milk," but not here. This is the only Starbucks that gets my business. Truly.

While visiting my father who was admitted to St. Joseph, I had to get my Americano fix. The first day, I felt like the barista was irritated that I had asked if they had a canister of non-fat milk. ...  ... The second day I had brought a 2nd visit coupon from another location. The offer said $2.00 iced drink after 2PM, which sounded great. The same barista, the one with the mullet, was quick to point out the fine print "Participating Locations Only" with a nasty attitude. When I told him that I didn't feel right buying full priced Starbucks drinks twice in a day, he rolled his eyes and said "Oh well, YOUR LOSS!" ...  ... So today, I made every effort to get my coffee elsewhere. I usually look for the non-corporate coffee shop, however, in this neighborhood it seems like the only options for quick espresso drinks in this area the Starbucks peppered all over the downtown area. ...  ... The staff here made me really appreciate the Starbucks by my house as well as all of those small independently owned shops that I really enjoy so much more. ... If you must get your Starbucks and you are going to the St. Joe's, GET IT ON THE WAY, NOT HERE!

I love Starbucks....but have far too consistently had a poor experience with the staff at this location on hunt highway. Too many of the girls that work there have, more often than not, put off a rude and unfriendly vibe. They have acted snotty and irritated instead of friendly, helpful, and welcoming. I HATE the feeling i get when I go there, as far as their customer service goes.  I keep hoping the "girl" of the day is just having a bad day...but when I go back it's the same poor uncomfortable experience.  Part of the experience of going to Starbucks, is the HAPPY helpful understanding kind employees. This location needs an overhaul because I think they all ate a bag of "meany pants".  Get a clue people. Be nice!!!!

I went to Starbucks today to work on my homework and grab a coffee. However, I told the lady what I wanted and she told me that it was over 5 dollars. I always get a ice coffee with soy milk and white mocha. I let the lady know I would not pay that because its never over 4 dollars for that drink especially a grande. I've been buying this same drink for over a year now. She was so RUDE and kept telling me that was the price. She wouldn't help me figure out what the problem was. She just kept giving me a rude look and saying that was the price. I ended up telling her I wanted a refund. after I sat down, she preceded to talk badly about me behind the counter. I went back up to talk to another lady which I asked what the price was and she rang me up RIGHT. Apparently the lady who rung me up the first time didn't listen to what I wanted. This could have been prevented if she helped me by figuring out what was wrong. She was rude and unprofessional.

The food and beverages are always predictably good, the staff are always predictably friendly, and the seating is very much adequate. My only complaint, otherwise I'd give 4 or 5 stars, is the Internet access is super flaky. I'd come here to work but after far too many lost VPN connections there is absolutely no way I could trust this Wi-Fi service with my job duties. (In fact, I had to post this with the PotBelly WiFi because the Starbucks connection went down while logging into yelp.)

I have been to Starbucks all over this wonderful continent of ours....and this may be one of the best of them all. So let me set the scene for you because for you TRUE Starbucks fans you will understand what I am saying. Picture yourself walking into Starbucks.....the smell of the coffee drinks being made....dimly lit room.....tables and chairs for all of those who want have there latte's,....tea....coffee....iced coffee...mocha's.....pastries......ipads.....laptops....cellphones....etc....Then BLAM THOSE HUGE LINES....PEOPLE WALKING BETWEEN YOU AND OVER YOU BECAUSE THE COUNTER IS RIGHT NEARBY AND YOUR LIKE ARRRRRRRHHHHH. However those days are a thing of the past at this location. ...  ... There is plenty of outdoor seating.....nice dimly lit room as usual.....tons and I mean tons of space and outlets for that matter for you to get digitally plugged in no matter what kind of device you have.....and then BLAM.....ooooohhhh wait I got ya there...LOL. ...  ... There is no BLAM because the "digital" space you have to work with is at least 20 feet from the counter.....and while it does get busy here....you won't really notice a crowd unless your absolutely paying attention to the crowd only. The service is awesome....the coffee drinks are awesome as always.....and trust me they really do keep the line moving. I was really impressed with the size of this location....I have not seen one bigger....I was also impressed with all of the "digital" space and outdoor seating......have not seen more anywhere........I was also impressed with the service....I was also impressed.....WAIT.....I think you get my drift.....I WAS IMPRESSED PERIOD. ...  ... This Starbucks has shot up to #1 on my list of Starbucks locations....if you know one better anywhere in the country...with the exception of the one at Starbucks Headquarters....LOL....please let me know.....and as always continue to Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!!

Ok, don't nut punch me 'cause I'm writing a review on Da Bux.  I'm not here to review the mediocre drip, the yeast infected pastries, nor the annoying indie music.  I'm here to say that this Starbucks has more eye candy for the 30 something crowd than a 75% off sale at Banana Republic.  It starts with being one of the largest Bux in all of Phoenix.  It is 3X bigger than any of the other green brown stations in the area.  This lends itself to bunches of coffee cake crusted comfy cushions and chairs that spill out into an L-shaped patio with a Parisian bistro flair.  Now for you ladies (hey, hey, ladies!), the pecs around here usually sport specs since they are in their 30's to 50's, but they got cash (or they are at least nicely dressed perverts).  NOW, for us guys, the breasts around here are more fake then the goods lining Shanghai's flea markets.  But heck, as long as those nipples aren't plastic, I'll bite. ...  ... +++'s: THE best Starbucks for older eye-candy (30+), free Wi-fi with your starbucks card, ample seating, always a good clean crowd, in Kierland commons ...  ... - - -'s: it's another Starbucks ...  ... In sum, if you want to enjoy a cup of Joe (or Jane) in style, this is the Starbucks to do it at.

The only reason to drink coffee is if I'm all stopped-up from my wife's pot roast. Otherwise I steer clear of coffee and caffeine related products. ...  ... Fortuitously however, I discovered another reason to like coffee, and did so at Starbucks yesterday. ... Their trenta sized cup. ...  ... It was a great Sunday dinner...pot roast as usual but now it was Monday morning and time to 'pay the piper'. I stopped at Starbucks on the way to work. ...  ... As bad luck sometimes has it, traffic was running slow that day...much slower than usual. I suspected something was wrong.  ... It was...the overhead freeway sign indicating a severe crash on the 51. ...  ... Great. ... I just drank thirty ounces of coffee and was now in the throes of a face-grimacing, bladder-busting event. ... This is where the thirty ounce cup came in handy.  ... Once filled with warm, steaming coffee, it was now filled with something equally warm and steaming. ...  ... Whether you like coffee or not, you'll enjoy the wide rimmed opening and the large capacity of the trenta sized cup.  ... It's able to contain even the most hearty of uncontrollable pissing events.  ...  ... Way to go Starbucks trenta!

I don't have much in common with people that live in Scottsdale (no money, no little dog with blinged out collar, and no BMW) but I do enjoy the ample seating and courteous staff of this Starbucks location. There are an abundant number of comfy seats (10 I think), regular seating (at least 20 seats) and a huge outside seating area (with at least 10 tables), more than any other Starbucks I've been too. It's usually pretty busy during the day, but in the evening it's the perfect place to study or meet a few friends.  ...  ... Although I usually just get an iced tea or water, the times I've ordered other drinks they were well-made and to my specifications. On the one occasion they forgot to make my drink, they promptly gave me a free drink coupon and apologized profusely.  ...  ... All that being said, it's still a Starbucks and if you're afraid of the big bad corporation, feel free to steer clear. ;) Being in a part of town where there aren't any indy coffee shops, I have little choice. But, if you're feeling brave, and in the mood to have a cup of joe in a nice location, Starbucks at Kierland is a good choice!

REVIEW #9:  4 stars  (224 chars)
I love Starbucks no matter the location but as the Kierland Starbucks location is closest to my office, it is the one I most visit! With that said I love the staff here as they are very friendly and always remember my order!

I refuse to review a Starbucks.  Oops, I just did!

REVIEW #11:  4 stars  (1218 chars)
If I had it in my heart to give a Starbucks a five-star review, this would be it. But in writing a review, I have to take into account the coffee product itself, and honestly, with our Jura machine at home, we get better coffee and espresso, and go figure --  we use Starbucks beans.  I'll chock it up to our grind and strength. ...  ... Having prefaced it by the above, this is probably the best Starbucks location I've visited. Even with ten people ahead of me in line, it was less than five minutes before I had my cafe latte and spinach, egg white and feta wrap in hand! The place was packed with nary an available seat inside, so I grabbed one of  the comfy outdoor patio seats. It was a perfect morning to linger over my drink while I waited for a friend to finish up at the dentist.  ...  ... It's also great for people watching as just about everyone who works at Kierland Commons stops by for "whatever". ...  ... As an aside, it was the first time I tried the spinach, egg white and feta wrap, based on the recommendations of two young girls in line behind me, and ooh, it is by far the best "fast food" breakfast I have ever had!  Kudos to Starbucks for steering me clear of the former beloved Egg McMuffin!

REVIEW #12:  4 stars  (1006 chars)
It was a rainy day today, and I was meeting two friends to study at Starbucks at Kierland.  A great location with plenty of seating, apparently everyone had the same idea as me.  When I walked in, all inside seating was taken and there were long lines to order drinks and also for the restroom.  Recognizing this was due to the weather and that Starbucks couldn't do anything differently about this, I was quite impressed with how quickly the lines moved and how friendly the staff were.   ...  ... Ordering a tall hot chocolate, I enjoyed a nice hot beverage while only waiting a short while to find seats for my friends and me to study.  With so many people there, the Internet was quite slow for a while until many of the customers left (when the weather got better).  More seating appeared, the lines subsided, and the Internet got faster.  All in all, it was a very productive few hours for my friends and me as we also got several beverages and enjoyed the atmosphere.  I'll definitely be going back!

REVIEW #17:  4 stars  (440 chars)
This place is always packed!!! But it is a great place to work because they have the coolest "desktops" near the front entrance. ...  ... There are also an abundance of the "comfy" living room style chairs.  ...  ... This is a "big" Starbuck compared to others in the area. There is almost always a line waiting to order. But they keep things moving.  ...  ... Aside from my above comments... its a Starbucks. You either love it or hate it.

REVIEW #19:  3 stars  (756 chars)
A large and always-busy location, the Starbucks at Kierland has a reputation as the "pickup" Starbucks, as in, it's a great place to meet and perhaps find a spark with fellow coffee lovers.  ...  ... The pre-work line can get long, but behind the counter they move fast. I've set up shop a few times to work and haven't had trouble finding a spot, usually against the wall for some good people watching (no Prince Charmings though)!  The last dirty chai latte I had from this location was overly milky, so that's clouding my mind right now!  ...  ... If you are a foufy drink aficionado, check it out, but if you're a purist, save some money and head around the corner to Chloe's for 50 cent hot or iced coffees and fantastically unique muffins and scones.

REVIEW #20:  3 stars  (1078 chars)
As a Starbuck's Gold Card holder (aka I drink far too much Starbucks), I have become accustomed to certain attitudes and services from them. And this place didn't really hold up to those expectations. First off, this Starbuck's is located in a large outdoor mall so you know it is going to be busy. It was about 5pm on a Saturday and there were still a few hours left in their day. Once we got up to the counter, there was no hello or smile, just what can I get you. We ordered 2 Soy Lattes and the first thing the barista says is they don't know if they have any soy left. I'm sorry but you are a Starbucks located in a mall, how do you run out of an essential item like soy or any type of milk like product half way through you day?? After checking with other workers, they said there is just enough for us but then they are out. Awesome. We at least got our soy lattes but what about everyone else for the next 4 hours they are open? It is like saying they ran out of half and half. I'm sorry but a Starbucks should not run out of certain things and creamers are one of them.

REVIEW #21:  2 stars  (111 chars)
Positively the snobbiest Starbucks I've ever been to. Get over yourselves and crack a smile, for goodness sake!

REVIEW #22:  2 stars  (2183 chars)
So, at this point we've all formed an opinion of what we think of Starbucks coffee?  Either it floats your boat or doesn't. ...  ... Coming from the Pacific Northwest, I was use to a wide selection of different coffee places, Tully's and Peet's (where it all began) for example; or any of the number of small coffee shacks that seem to be on every corner in greater Seattle.  But here in the Valley, unless you're willing to track down a Fry's Marketplace to find a Tully's, you'll need to settle for Starbucks. ...  ... Now that I've gotten that out out of the way, I have a love hate relationship with this Starbucks location.  I come here several times each day, or to the Press Coffee across Scottsdale Road.  The Baristas are great, very friendly and rarely if ever get my order wrong.  What is frustrating is what I call the Internet moochers.  Because of Starbuck's free WiFi policy, there is never a place to sit inside and enjoy your drink and read the paper.  Or, God forbid, getting up and ordering a refill.  People will pounce on that seat! ...  ... It was different before they changed the policy and made WiFi free.  Don't get me wrong, some days it's actually pretty good.  But for the most part it's a bear getting a seat and what is the capacity here?  50, maybe 75?  That's a lot of customers drinking Mr. Schultz's version of Peet's coffee!  So I would guess this is one of the largest, certainly most profitable stores in the greater Phoenix area.  Why change the business model if it isn't broken, right? ...  ... Well in the beginning, when Mr. Schultz took over the marketing at Peet's, he wanted to recreate that coffee house feeling that he found in Paris.  The feeling I have here is of a college library on caffeine.  A lot of laptops open, but not a lot of coffee being drank. ...  ... So, if you're on the run and just want to grab a Cup of Joe, then this is your best bet in the Kierland area.   ...  ... But, if you want to order your brew, sit down and read the paper, or just enjoy a conversation with your neighbor -- try Press Coffee across Scottsdale Road and the real life version of Frogger getting there.  Now, that will get your heart racing!

REVIEW #23:  2 stars  (318 chars)
Super busy and pretty dirty!!! Huge trash pile with 2 overflowing trash cans.  The bar where you pick up your drink was sopping wet with ???? ...  ... My friend and I met here and we saw a nice lady with a hermes birkin!  Seriously, class up Starbucks! ...  ... The women's restroom also had no tp!  Really nice touch.

REVIEW #24:  1 stars  (714 chars)
I arrived at around three, there was one lady ahead of me at the end of the counter already waiting for her drink. Sadly the barista was too busy flirting to notice I was in my work uniform and clearly on a break. Ten minutes later I get a cup two thirds of the way full of watered down chai. I don't know if he put skim milk in there or what, but I asked for whole milk and was very disappointed in what I got. It shouldn't take ten minutes to make a full decent cup of chai, let alone part of a poor one. Give me a break. I watched him and he was talking, not paying attention to what he was doing and stopped several times to chat with another lady while making my drink. It's no wonder I prefer Dutch Brothers.

REVIEW #25:  1 stars  (239 chars)
Went in with a friend who wanted to meet here.  I've never been a fan of SBX, truly the MCDs of coffee. ...  ... Save the money, either buy good grounds to make your own cup or go to Circle K for a slightly better coffee at half the price.

If I had to write a review for EVERYTIME I come here well...anyway. I drive thru pretty much every morning however if the line is too long (Which often times it is depending on who is running it) I will pop in for my Venti no foam latte with 3 sugars in the raw. For those of you who tell me there is no foam in a latte Just zip it there is and Starbucks puts a ton of it in unless you tell them not to OK! ... Anyhow they are always SO nice there, never a problem...if they make a mistake they always fix it. One day they found out I was buying some coffee for the teacher and so they gave me a bunch of brand new drinks they had made wrong (All hot) and said here give them to the teachers they deserve it! How nice is that?  Ya don't get service like that very often. I found a home for every one of them. I had like 6 coffees plus the two I bought...Anyway very convenient and always friendly!

REVIEW #4:  4 stars  (1163 chars)
Since this Starbucks is right in the middle of North Scottsdale, you gotta expect great service here. Usually, they deliver! (The four stars is in relation to other Starbucks locations, not coffee shops in general.) ...  ... The staff here is overly friendly, which I prefer (better than unfriendly). Some of the baristas know me by name because I worked close by for a year and a half. The turnover rate is as high as any other Starbucks, but those who know me are pretty familiar with my order, and one guy even asks if I want my "usual." I always love that.  ...  ... Unfortunately, this location has a poorly designed drive-through that is INSANELY BUSY for much of the day. I tried it a few times in the morning and have waited upwards of 15 minutes for a drink. The setup is just a disaster - the line starts to block the whole parking lot, and since people drive like crazies in this complex, you have to be careful and aware when pulling in or out of an area. Just a heads up. ...  ... But inside, the staff is pretty quick, and I've never had to wait too long for a drink. So if you're in a hurry, going inside during busy times might actually be faster.

REVIEW #5:  3 stars  (522 chars)
I have always loved a good upside down iced caramel macchiato at Starbucks and with that said I will continue to go. My only complaint to this one particular Starbucks was the manager. I don't recall her name but she has dark hair and has a hard time smiling. She looks down right miserable. If you dislike your job and you work in the service industry please do the die hard Starbucks customers a favor and leave. Other than that hiccup I will always enjoy my iced drink even though sour puss tries to ruin my experience.

REVIEW #6:  3 stars  (666 chars)
This Starbucks location is one of the busiest in northern Scottsdale (though the location on Shea Blvd is probably worse).   ...  ... On the other hand the folks inside are wonderful.  I've never had an order mistake and the line moves very fast.  Nice group of Baristas! ...  ... The parking lot is shared with Good Egg and Subway and it can become very crowded and crazy in the mornings.  I've seen many a luxury car get rear ended in the lot while it's owner is inside getting a latte.  At times the drive-thru (poorly thought out) can wind around the corner ten deep. No exaggeration. ...  ... So, as they use to say on TV:  "Let's be careful out there, people!"

REVIEW #7:  2 stars  (177 chars)

REVIEW #8:  1 stars  (323 chars)
This is the slowest Starbucks I have ever been to. Third in line and it took 30 minutes to order and get my drinks. Part of the problem was some rookie ordering stupid drinks and part of the problem was the guy working the register was new. They have way to much employee turnover here, you have to wonder what is going on.

REVIEW #9:  1 stars  (498 chars)
Why is it that people who work at starbucks think its ok for them to ignore customers when they are in a con station with other staff ...  ... All I want is a cup of coffee, I don't want to be your friend, you don't need to know my name. I am the only one I the store! It's not like twenty people are here asking for a black coffee ... When I ask for a black coffee why do you ask if I want room? Room for what ? I want it black! ...  ... Please Starbucks teach your staff to serve not make friends

This is my favourite Starbucks for many reasons. It is within walking distance from my house. The staff is always super friendly and always smiling. ...  ... I also enjoy the new food selections including the bistro boxes, sandwiches and paninis. Another nice feature is the outside seating that extends to under the trees. ...  ... I just discovered the new Starbucks app on my phone, and like the fact that I can have my Starbucks card on my phone,  with the added features and benefits.

REVIEW #6:  1 stars  (873 chars)
I will never come back here. They couldn't understand how to make a Mocha Frappe with Hazelnut flavor. Once that was finally figured out, I overheard that they had spilled my drink dumping half the contents out. I saw them pick up the cup and used the same cup to remake my drink, when I asked for a new drink in a clean cup, the shift supervisor got huffy about it, angrily grabbed my drink threw it hastily in the trash can and made me a new drink in a clean cup finally.  ...  ... Although they did give me a card that says they were sorry I had a bad experience enjoy a beverage on us, that didn't excuse the bad customer service and possible health violation of serving a drink in a dirty cup.  ...  ... This Starbucks was very packed and very poorly ran. I would expect more out of a place like this and would assume anyone else would have wanted a clean cup as well.

REVIEW #7:  1 stars  (193 chars)
Not that any SBUX is worth going out of your way for, but this one is worth skipping. The service I've experienced each time I've been is pretty dang poor and the drinks always seem quite cold.

I've been to this location a few times while getting gas and shopping at Albertson's or other stores in the area.

REVIEW #4:  5 stars  (238 chars)
Rarely crowded. 4 tables indoors, many more outdoors. Wifi is usually fast. Only downside is that it's next to a gas station, so the visuals out the window aren't exactly spectacular. But if you care about that, why are you in Scottsdale?

i have always like starbucks. they serve good, predictable strong coffee for a decent price. i have never had a bad service experience in a starbucks....if my coffee ever tasted stale, cold, old, whatever, they always, always, always fix it...no question....sort of like the wal-mart of coffee. plus, it's always so cozy in a starbucks.  ...  ... i have never gotten a fancy coffee....always the same...."small" coffee. but i received a gift card for this christmas towards starbucks this year. and i am constantly craving caramel machiatto's (sp?). this thing is fantastic! it's so sweet and strong and just plain delicious. please don't tell me how many calories are in it because then i'll feel guilty for drinking them...but man, they are like macayo's margarita's on a hot day....they go down so quick and smooth, and before i know it, i'm wanting another. unfortunately, i have to sleep sometime, so i'll have to ration for now....until my gift card runs out then it's back to regular, plain ol coffee....2.65 for a small....robbery i tell you!

REVIEW #3:  5 stars  (1095 chars)
I know Starbucks are the big bad corporate guys, but they're actually a pretty sustainable company, and their employees even get insurance if they're part-time, which is more than you can say for more part-time employers. I always feel I have to explain why I like a chain store, which is ridiculous, since its' a free country, but I think Starbucks has a pretty strong case. Anyway, this location is always pretty busy, but the baristas are unfailingly pleasant and friendly, and the couple of times they've messed up my drink orders, they've been quick to fix the situation. The manager is often there and hops right in with the others, making drinks and acting like any other member of the team. I'm a complex individual when it comes to coffee, I love to experiment and try new twists on things, and a couple of the baristas in particular have had some yummy ideas. White chocolate mocha with a pump of raspberry and a pump of hazelnut! I know it sounds like too much but just try it. ...  ... I need to learn how to make cake pops at home, though, my cake-pop lust is getting too expensive!

This location squeezes as many seats and outlets as possible into one small location. They know everyone coming in needs a place to sit and needs a spot to power up. Between all the outdoor chairs and all the seating indoors, you should find a spot. It's just not a comfortable joint if you're looking to sit and chat with someone. But for me and my laptop, it's perfect.  ...  ... Fun for people watching on Scottsdale road on the weekend.

Starbucks is Starbucks when it comes to the coffee and food, but the staff at this location are particularly helpful and nice. One offered to help me decide on what drink to choose, and promised that if I did not like it, he would make me another one free of charge. The seating is a bit limited because the place is somewhat small, but other than that, an above average cookie cutter Starbucks.

REVIEW #16:  4 stars  (536 chars)
This particular Starbucks doubles as a police station. Want to get a free Starbucks at any point? Make a bet that either a cop is either inside or will walk in while ordering a drink. I guess bougie Scottsdale cops must be getting paid more than the Dunkin' Doughnut variety. Regardless, at least you can rest assured that the pastries will be fresh. ...  ... Altogether a pretty good Starbucks, but it lacks a seating area for groups, which drops it a star. Other than that, the drinks are par and the staff isn't rude. Can't complain.

REVIEW #17:  3 stars  (635 chars)
I am not a person that frequents Starbucks. I don't particularly like the chain for a plethora of reasons, but that is where a friend of mine that I was reconnecting with after 15 years wanted to grab a coffee, so I was not in a place to argue. ...  ... Though I will say that the coffee tasted reminiscent of paint thinner, which it has at every Starbucks that I have visited across the country, the staff here was friendly and perky. The barista was especially cool, and fun, and she helped to make my experience at a coffee shop that I generally disdain, more pleasant. The place was clean too which Starbucks stores are not always.

Okay, first thing is first, I love my coffee, and I love Starbucks but THIS particular location has failed to please me, twice. The first time was about 3 weeks ago, I came here on a Wednesday afternoon, wanting a vanilla chai latte. Eh, I must say, it wasn't as tasty as I expect but hey, everyone makes mistakes, no biggie. So today I decided, let me try this location put again since I'm here. I got here around 10 am. I went through the drive-thru and it was PACKED as usual. When I got to the window I specifically ordered a tall double chocolate chip frappucino. What I was handed was a Venti Carmel macchiato. Um...and when I told her what I did order, the barista caught the nastiest attitude and told me that I should have spoken louder. Exxxcusssseee me?!?! Being the nice human I am, I took my new drink she handed me and it was a java chip frappucino .....*sigh* I am so over this. I smiled and put 2 bucks in the tip jar and drove away.  ... Okay, LOVE LOVE Starbucks but this location, no I will hold off, thank you.

Visited here while I was in town for spring training 3 different times. This place gets pretty busy, and I don't mind waiting for my drink but they didn't know how to handle the rushes very well. They wouldn't call out drinks or names rather let them sit there to be picked up. The line moved really slowly and the crew seemed like they weren't all working together or communicating. I will say they did make my drink perfect each time, can't compain there.

REVIEW #2:  5 stars  (107 chars)
Always super busy but the crew at the drive thur always has a smile for me no mater what day or time it is.

REVIEW #3:  5 stars  (518 chars)
Been going here since the first day they opened. The staff is great but one in particular, Alexa McCall (or McCaw?) is an exceptional employee.  While waiting for my coffee I overheard a couple talking about her as well. They said she creates a very fun atmosphere. I'm amazed at how many customers who are driving up say hello by her name!  Wow!! Now if that doesn't prove excellent customer service I don't know what does. I agree with the couple this Starbucks has a great vibe. Oh, great  Latte's too!  Kudos to ya

Great Location!  Very professional!

REVIEW #5:  5 stars  (718 chars)
I've been going here off and on for 5 years and the customer service here is amazing! I went on a no Starbucks strike for about a year not because I don't love my Starbucks but I purchased a very expensive espresso maker and wanted to get my money's worth from it.. Anyways I have a thing with touching cold stuff so I always get a sleeve on all of my iced drinks so after a year of being absent I drove thru the  drive thru ordered my venti iced Carmel macchiato and sure enough they remembered me and put my beloved sleeve on my drink! Love these guys especially the long haired skinny one. They are always so nice and remembered how I like my coffee after a year of not seeing me!  ...  ... Great customer service!!

REVIEW #6:  4 stars  (270 chars)
Not a fast drive thru service but the staff is pretty friendly.  There's a guy there who works the drive thru window and he makes great conversation while you wait for your drink.  IThe only negative thing is that they only sell plain bagels. I wish they had multigrain!

REVIEW #7:  3 stars  (341 chars)
Def not your standard Starbucks as far as layout.  There is no inside sitting area and Scottsdale is usually scorching hot in the summer.  There are misters outside and awesome shade that help with the heat.  It took longer to get a drink, but it was an ok experience.  It is just another Starbucks...nothing too special about this location.

REVIEW #8:  3 stars  (982 chars)
Not sure why there are such bad reviews for this location. As far as Starbucks go, it is pretty average (not especially bad). They get points knocked off due to the small size and lack of sitting/lounging space. You can only walk up or drive thru at this location :( But the drive thru is quick enough. I've never had any issues with my order getting mixed up or attitude from the baristas. I mostly visit in evenings or afternoon and it is never busy.  I've also been during morning hours, but not super early... so I can't comment on early morning rush. ...  ... Seems like this low rating is partially skewed from people who don't like Starbucks coffee in general... understood, but I wish we could just filter out those reviews.  After all, we all know what Starbucks IS and ISN'T by now. Some of us need an accurate review of the location without coffee snobbery polluting the rating :P  ... (see there ^^^ I included the smiley so my snobby coffee brethren can't take offense)

REVIEW #9:  3 stars  (223 chars)
Small Drive-thru and walk-up window at this location. Outdoor restroom with key access that was moderately clean. Drink was excellent and the outdoor seating area was small but adequate. The window staff were very friendly.

REVIEW #10:  2 stars  (368 chars)
They are consistently busy, but apparently are not able to perfect their craft. Very, very slow. Whether it be four cars in line, or twelve, I always seem to be waiting at least 15 minutes or more for my coffee. One time it took SO long, they gave me my coffee for free... which is nice... but when I got to my destination I saw that both drinks I received were wrong.

REVIEW #11:  2 stars  (500 chars)
You'll never find me rating a Starbucks lower than a 4, but this one is way too congested. Yes, the staff is friendly and it is convenient, the parking lot/drive through is a mess.  ...  ... This Starbucks is a drive thru - walkup window only. On busy mornings, you'll find yourself backed up onto the street just trying to drive in. If you decide to walk up, you need to park your car and get out. The drive-thru lane and parking lot overlap, which makes it hard to back-up out of your parking spot.

REVIEW #12:  1 stars  (638 chars)
Horrible service. Twice now I've gone there and they keep messing up my drink. I work for Starbucks!! It's not hard to get a drink right! Believe me. Horrible service. The people that work there All have bad attitude. One lady doesn't even look at you when your ordering your drink. I think that someone needs to go In there and fix it and make it a welcoming Starbucks that it's known for. Ya a few of the employees that work there are absolutely wonderful but when you get that one that is just rude it just makes you not want to go there anymore. I stopped going. They still get my drink wrong when my mom goes to get coffee. Horrible.

REVIEW #13:  1 stars  (1139 chars)
I wish I could give it a half of a star.. The only thing they do "right" is that they make some kind of drink for you.  It's probably not going to be what you ordered, but I guess there's always the option of going back, waiting in line for another 10 minutes, asking them to remake it, getting a dirty look about it, then finally getting it back 5 minutes later. ...  ... Who wouldn't want to do that...? ...  ... This is the closest location to my house; however, it is the LAST one I would choose to go to..  : / ...  ... The set up is semi inconvenient, but I don't really go at the rush hour times of day, so I can't comment on that aspect.  SOME of the baristas are nice, but out of the 30 times I have gone there, I think my drink has been made correctly 6 or 7 times.  That kind of inaccuracy is not what I would expect from anywhere, much less such a well known company like Starbucks. ...  ... But on the other hand, I don't HAVE to go to this location, it's just the most convenient, so I guess I should just suck it up and drive to a different location- like the one inside Desert Ridge.  I've never had a bad experience there.

REVIEW #15:  1 stars  (579 chars)
This is the worst Starbucks I have ever been to across all 50 states.  ...  ... 1. They can't multitask and serve multiple customers (it takes 20 minutes to get your drink). I don't care how busy you think you are; I have seen busier Starbucks figure it out.  ...  ... 2. When they make a drink with flavoring, they put the flavor in with the milk and steam it, this burns the syrup and spoils the drink.  ...  ... 3. No one smiles or says a simple 'thank you'.  ...  ... This Starbucks is less then a mile from my house (in walking distance) I am now a proud owner of a Tassimo.

REVIEW #16:  1 stars  (626 chars)
Whatever you do, don't visit this location. I've been a Gold Card member for a long time, and never had an issue at any other locations. The 3 times I have visited this location, I've had bad experiences. ...  ... Just today, On Starbucks.com and at another location, I was told I could get the Frapp Happy Hour discount until 6pm. The person that I dealt with would not honor the discount, and it's clearly shown online!  ...  ... Anytime I mentioned that the discount goes till 6, the employee just asked if I wanted to pay with my gold card or another way, totally avoiding the issue! What kind of customer service is that?

This location is fab for many reasons. The renovation is awesome! The staff is super nice and helpful. Yeah, there is no WIFI (how is that possible!?!?) and it can get a bit cramped inside. However, it's just up the road from the disaster of a store at Scottsdale road and pinnacle peak. I make the jog over to come to this store, and it's 99/100 times faster. I love the sit down bar area in front of the clover brewing system! All in all - the way every store should be. Oh, can't forget the awesome patio space thy have!

Nice Starbucks in far far North Scottsdale. ...  ... Basically all the retail in this area revovles around strip malls.  You can't escape it as this Starbucks is located in one; however, they do have a nice outdoor patio which has views of the mountains.  You can't beat that with your morning cup of Joe.

REVIEW #4:  4 stars  (790 chars)
Visited here on Christmas Eve morning and it was packed! I was thinking, "aw man, this is going to take for-ev" and then I got to the front of the line an put my order in, haha. Super fast and efficient! I enjoy the unique name spellings that both me (which is common cause I have a different name) and my friend Gina got transcribed on our cups (her's was spelled 'Jeanay'). They were up staffed, which helped, and all the employees seemed to be in a jolly mood. ...  ... Again, it was super packed and thus no where to sit inside, but there were a few tables left to choose from outside. Unfortunately they were all in the shade, making this thin-blooded Arizonian, unable to tolerate the weather for more than seven minutes before we retreated back to my car with our scrumptious drinks.

REVIEW #5:  3 stars  (216 chars)
It's Starbucks.  You know what you're getting.  I did try the blonde roast recently, and it's definetly milder.  Not to my liking, but if you're not a fan of their usual blends, try the Blonde.  It really is lighter.

REVIEW #6:  3 stars  (372 chars)
Out of the several Starbucks I've tried north of the loop in Scottsdale, this is the only one worth going to. The others are just run of the mill. While this location is also pretty much standard, it also features the Clover brewing system. Sadly, their bathroom doesn't have a urinal. ... Long-short: this is the fancy Starbucks. If you have the choice, come to this one.

REVIEW #7:  2 stars  (1815 chars)
I would first like to say I am a Starbucks addict. Even more true, I'm a caffeine addict and mother of 2 young children. I can't say that I necessarily HAVE to have Starbuck's brand coffee. I can't even say that Starbucks has the best coffee and lattes around. It's more of the little things that I have begun to love and appreciate about when I go there. First and foremost, I love it that all the baristas at my regular (most frequented) Starbucks know my name and know my drink. They are the hardest workers out there dealing with a lot of nasty Snottsdale customers and they serve my drink with a smile on their faces. Secondly, they are consistent and if they made my drink unsatisfactorily, they have always remade it and STILL with a smile on their face and a sincere apology. Lastly, they are friendly to my kids. My kids can be some of the loudest and not always as well behaved as I'd like them to be but the baristas talk to them, give them stickers and even know their name!! ... Occasionally, I have been to other Starbucks near my neighborhood because it's more convenient than going to my 'regular' Starbucks. I have been to the one at Pinnacle and Pima  maybe 15 or so times. Most of the baristas that work there are awesome but there is one lady that is consistently grumpy and crotchety. I wish I had a dime for every time for every time she threw out ATTITUDE and eye roll as if her day was ruined by brewing my coffee. If I did, I would definitely have a fortune to pay for my Starbucks addiction. ... I used to think it was just me or maybe she had a bad day but she is consistently rude. My husband, separately and unsolicited, has told me he has had the same experience with her.  ... Why do we keep going? The answer plain and simple: My addiction is strong and this Starbucks is convenient.

REVIEW #8:  1 stars  (2151 chars)
THIS STORE IS TERRIBLE! THE WORST SERVICE I'VE EVER HAD! ...  ... As a former Starbucks employee I was APALLED at the disgusting service my mom and I received here. We walked in about an hour before closing time and I ordered an iced grande white mocha, she ordered an iced venti, lite caramel sauced melted in the bottom 2 splenda Americano...honestly, not that complicated! We weren't really greeted, we more or less received an annoyed glance from the barista and the shift supervisor working. The guy making our drinks didn't pay any attention, didn't mark our cups and didn't call back to the person ringing us up! He was too busy talking to his friend, also an employee there who was off the clock, to pay attention to what he was getting paid 8 bucks and hour to do. He of course messed up our order, and when my mom pointed out that her drink was  gritty, he sighed, rolled his eyes and promptly informed us that it "was the splenda that YOU ordered in your drink..." instead of apologizing and offering to remake it. I don't expect a kiss ass but some on, have some customer service common sense! My mom, being irritated with the guys rudeness just asked for a drink coupon, which the shift supervisor informed her it would take 10 minutes for her to get one (they're supposed to keep them up in the front at all times for reasons like this! duh...). The off-shift partner then said "just give her a piece of paper that says one free drink and sign your name with the store number" which she did.  ...  ... Here's where it get's good.. ... We turned around and left the store, minding our own business when the rat-faced employee off the clock says "I bet they didn't f!@#ing ask for it metled, that b1tc!" to which I turned around and replied, " Actually she FUCKING did ask for it melted, but you were too busy distracting your little barista buddy for him to pay any attention to his job" she then promptly informed me and my mom we could go "back to South Scottsdale, honey" and that she wouldn't get into trouble for how she acted... ... We called the manager and still have not heard back over a month later. Amazingly terrible service.

Gotta love Starbucks!

REVIEW #2:  4 stars  (450 chars)
It's Starbucks, so you know what to expect in terms of product. This location gets an above average rating because they have not screwed up my order too often and because it is closest drive-thru location on my way to work. The drive thru entry and exit is a little wonky--but this seems to be the case with all other Starbucks in this area (if I ever happen upon a Starbucks with a thoughtfully designed drive thru, I just may faint from the shock).

This is a Starbucks - they have coffee.  I do not drink coffee, as I consider it homeless food, but I do drink tea, which I purchased on this visit.  It was not bad.  Also, the scoundrel who took my order said "May the force be with you" as I left, which I believe is a movie reference.  I appreciate his joviality.

*SIGH* ...  ... Iced soy caramel macchiato, you are...the bomb. Like *tick tick*...you and you alone deserve 5 stars despite your evil origins (no, I'm not going to go into a long rant or tirade about the nefarious motives of the Starbucks Corporation...it's like complaining about carbs while eating a pb&j sandwich...I'll let you witness my hypocrisy at another time...). ...  ... However, I get really annoyed when I have a gift card and for some reason or other the cashier says 'the card isn't working in our machine, you will need to call the phone number on the back of the card to get your balance', please give us another form of payment. (Which I invariably do, because I would rather just get the transaction over with instead of bickering with people who handle my consumables (foods, drinks...Drinks...etc.) ...  ... However, that will not stop me from Yelp!ng my feelings about how you done done me wrong...here goes... ...  ...  ... 1) The gift card is for YOUR store (well, not YOUR store entirely (probably), but it's certainly more YOUR store than MY store, as I imagine you are more likely to claim it than I am...in general...blah blah blah...semantics). The phone number is on the card in YOUR hand. The card number is ALSO on the card that YOU are holding. And you are the one who is processing the purchase. Cashiers are the alchemists of the retail world. I push a card through your window, you not only return my card to me, intact...but you also give me a present (sure, if you're going to get hung up on details, I BOUGHT the present...but you can't tell that just from looking at the card)...and a receipt (ok, the receipt kinda gives you a clue that it isn't 'REALLY' a present...but who looks at receipts anyway? Not I, said the cat!!)  ...  ... It's awesome! Oh...oops, sorry, I got distracted...back to the point... ...  ... Why aren't YOU able to get the balance of the card and/or type in the 16 digits?  ...  ... It's not like I'm going to go to starbucks.com to buy apparel. (That ain't my style)...The card is going to have to be used at an actual brick and mortar store, because I tend to use Starbucks cards for...(and you can call me crazy if you'd like, in fact, please do...it gives me a warm, tingly feeling all over...or maybe that's the mischievous, frolicsome (is that a word? Well...it is now!) coffee-beany pheromones wafting up to my nose sending a nearly instantaneous salivary response from my brain to my drooling mouth...*mmm...caffeine*) coffee...or sometimes tea if I'm feeling froggy. The card's magnetic strip will quite likely ALWAYS be faulty...but one way or another, you're going to need to figure out how to get that $50 off of the card and into your accounts receivable department...$6 at a time... ...  ... and ...  ... 2)...Well, there is no '2'.  ...  ... So cashier...for the benefit of everyone else out there with a good-giftcard-gone-bad, please just type in the dang number and we can all move on with our lives. ...   ... Thanks.

So I had just left Sally's in this shopping complex and was on my way to JoAnn's when my Starbucks radar kicked in and I saw this little (literally) shop. I honestly didn't think you could walk-in to this location, I thought it was drive-thru only. However, after I received my drink and started to drive off, someone walked in, lol. So FYI, if you want, you can go in, but you probably can't turn around ;) ... The lady at the drive-thru was nice and I didn't have to wait long for my delicious beverage.

REVIEW #8:  2 stars  (234 chars)
Everytime I go through the drive thru at this Starbucks, I end up leaving very frustrated. The wait time is always around 8 minutes, which is way too long for something that should be quick. I will not be coming back to this location!

i usually don't review starbucks because they're generally all the same. ...  ... this one was just not up to their brand standards, though. you can see on other reviews some of the issues i will mention here. ...  ... staff wasn't very friendly upon arrival. i ordered a hot beverage in the middle of a hot summer day. yes, i know what i ordered. why are you questioning me? O_o also, if you're going to ask my name, and then ask me to spell it to you, please try to listen. no point in having me spell it to you for you to get something completely different! #unusualnameproblems  it took about 10 minutes for my drink to be made. the guy that took my order just rang me up and walked away leaving the drive-thru barista to hop over to the other bar to make my drink. she didn't seem too pleased. sad thing was this translated into grumpy customer service. ...  ... i sat down in the room with all the tables and notices that there wasn't really any air flow. it was at least 104 degrees outside, but inside wasn't cool and refreshing like you expect starbucks to be.  ...  ... after sitting a while more, i began to notice how quiet it was in this area with all the tables. i could hear all the baristas bantering back and forth but there was no music!! music adds to the ambiance that IS starbucks.  ...  ... it was just a weird experience all together. thank god there are tons of them around so next time i can just pick an entirely different store to visit.

REVIEW #11:  2 stars  (586 chars)
Starbucks is Starbucks-mediocre at best. This particular location is just the slowest one I have been to, and the customer service is little to be desired. Maybe it's because it's a drive thru location?  ... One of the baristas gave me a hard time about getting soy in my coffee? He thought he was being funny but seriously.. You work in customer service, your sarcastic responses to my request are unnecessary. Also? If you're not busy, an iced coffee shouldn't take longer than 5 minutes to prepare.... Just saying. Considering the other reviews, this appears to be a recurrent issue.

REVIEW #12:  2 stars  (426 chars)
This location has some serious AC issues.  It's either 20 degrees too warm or 20 degrees to cold.  Customers all talk about it but nothing seems to ever get done about it.  The building is really 2 separate rooms.  1 is where you order your drinks and the other is where the sitting area is.  It feels like 2 completely different temperature zones.  They would benefit from a visit from someone to fix their thermostat issues.

REVIEW #13:  2 stars  (1122 chars)
This location is not up to Starbucks standards. I asked for a refill on my passion tea and the response was "did you just get in the drive through because if so I can't do a refill. I said no, I got it at another location much earlier today but I'll just get a water. ... .she said ok venti? I said yes and I'll also get a veggie breakfast sandwhich." I handed her my gift card and debit card to reload it. I said I have a coupon code and I had to repeat it twice. She could have just asked if I got my drink in a drive through and gave me the discount for having the same cup and listened for the code better or ask to see it on my phone to get it right. My breakfast sandwhich was cold in the middle and the guy before me got bacon and was asked if that is what he ordered. He said no I thought I ordered...and it was as different one and not the one I ordered. This location is always hiring. Maybe they were new but it seemed more like a lack of customer service skills. I wonder where the supervisor was during all of this. These people need training and the supervisor should have corrected the mistakes on the spot.

REVIEW #14:  1 stars  (1280 chars)
I generally would not be reviewing a Starbucks on yelp. I normally check in, and be on my way. Until my horrid experience today! ...  ... My drink is a bit on the complicated side. I order a Venti cinnamon dolce latte with 4 shots of espresso, breve and no whip. I've never had a barista question my order, aside from the typical,  "hot or iced?" Today, however, was the best I've ever had, "is that all?" With sarcastic laughter. Followed with, "that will be $6.53." I thought this was on the questionable side, because my drink is normally close to $8.00. For $8.00 a drink, it looks like I'm now also paying for sarcastic rude entertainment. The barista continues on with her rude behavior at the window. I was never greeted. I hear one employee talking to the other questioning my drink, followed by, "charge him for the breve." She finally comes to the window and says, "$7.83" I hand her my card. Still, no type of customer service.   ...  ... I finally get my drink, and thank her. She STILL SAYS NOTHING!! I thank her, and get nothing. Where is the customer service??? Is this place a ghetto franchise?  ...  ... I will never return to this location. I work in real estate and will spread the word.  HORRIBLE customer service! I wish I could give zero stars. Such a shame.

I will be the first one to admit that I have a Starbucks addiction and go there each and every day. You may judge me based on the fact I do not support local coffee houses, and that is all fine and dandy. But what I want every morning to start my day is great customer service and a consistently great product. Is this too much to ask? I certainly think not. ...  ... Occasionally I visit this Starbucks on my lazier mornings because they have a drive thru. I must say, the level of service, plainly stated, sucks here. They make my drink wrong every time and usually argue with me about it. Last time I checked, if I order something daily I know what is should look/taste like. Please just make it right the first time, and if you messed it up.....just say sorry with a smile and re-do it. Enough said. I will never be back to this location again, even on my lazy days. Having the convenience of a drive thru is not worth dealing with the nasty employees and slow service. ...  ... Now if you want a great Starbucks experience I would highly recommend the location at Scottsdale Fashion Square. Every employee there has a great attitude and John the manager exemplifies consistently great service.

Get out of your vehicle and go inside because its no fun to start your day with stress !! Ugh !!!!

Worst customer service!  They close their doors before 9, and I was in once and they asked someone to leave because they were closed and it was 4 min till 9!  Refused to refill a kids drink...even tho they have before and ALL other Starbucks have done so!  Worst manager in evenings!  Also, they said they couldn't do a pour over of Sumatra for me...they could only do what was brewing!  Don't waste your time...go to starbucks at Indian bend and scottsdale road!

REVIEW #2:  5 stars  (2321 chars)
As a former Starbucks shift manager, I hold Starbucks stores to extemely high standards. I frequent SBUX a lot. By a lot, I mean more than the average Starbucks freak. With that said my input is based on what I know the founder of Starbucks wanted out of each store, and how close the store is to achieving that level of quality service. If any of the points below has an "N/A" next to it, that simply means I was not able to form an opinion based on our interactions. ...  ... 1-Below Standards ... 2-Meets Standards ... 3-Outperforms Standards ...  ... Store Review ...  ... Let me preface this with two things. First, this store is not perfect whatsoever. However, this store is the busiest store in the state of Arizona in terms of revenues so in light of that, I'm cutting them some slack with the 5 stars. Second- The clientel that this store deals with is sometimes less than pleasant and they do a fantastic job at turning around bad situations. So lets begin!  ...  ... Avg Visits: twice/week ... Partner Friendliness: 2 Partners smile, cheery, initiated conversation, although there are a few bad apples  ... Partner Appearance: 3 All looked professional without exception ... Partner Knowledge: This crew is very experience and knows coffee and Starbucks well ...  ... Store Appearance (decor): 1 Could use some work ... Store Cleansliness: 3 despite being the busiest store, it is always clean from my experience ... Store Comfort:1 This is by far my biggest complaint. I used to frequent this store every day for lunch when I worked in this area. 3 out of 5 times, I could never get a seat and during Arizona's summer's, there was no chance I would sit outside. I often either had to give up finding a seat or wait 15-20 minutes to get a seat.  ...  ... *Either 1 or 2 for this section. Its either right or wrong* ... Beverage Taste: 2 Iced Single Venty Hazelnut Breve Iced Coffee ... Beverage Consistency: 2 Never had funny tasting drinks ... Beverage Temperature: 2 Always ice cold or steamy hot. ... Beverage Preparation (I watch): 2 No health hazards, shortcuts, etc. ... Beverage Mistakes: 2 Never had a wrong drink made.  ...  ... Will I return?: YES ...  ... I personally don't care for Starbucks food and do not believe that is what Starbucks is about. Therefore I do not review their food offerings.

Coffee, latte, mocha, et al. are always on-point and made with precision. ...  ...  ... I tried their healthy fare Spinach and Feta breakfast wrap yesterday and am now a FAN!

Definitely one of the busiest Starbucks ever...  the drive-thru is always chaotic, cars trying to get into the drive thru from the south, north and east ends.  Cars blocking the road, people walking in and out.  Watch out so you don't hit anyone!  However, inspite of all the chaos, the crew in this branch are super NICE & quite efficient actually!  They can usually deal with the drive thru traffic, it goes pretty fast but going inside is even faster.  Just park your car, go inside and pick up your coffee.  Sometimes, the inside line gets too long too but the baristas have a system tohasten  the line.  This Starbucks is in my "hood" and I go back all the time inspite of all the  chaos...  Why?  Because the service is GOOD!

Hey, look, here is another Starbucks on this corner, let me try it out and feed my coffee addiction! ... So, in all honesty, I have never ventured inside of this location. Being located right across the street from where I work, I'm usually one of the 7-10 cars in the drive-thru line at 0630 in the morning. But let me say, kudos to you Starbucks for making your drive-thru long enough to accommodate all of our semi parked cars in the morning! And double kudos for being able to make the drinks for the seven other cars in front of me quick enough that I'm not late for the start of my shift (no need to wake up earlier with this Starbucks crew)!  ...  ... xoxo

I enjoy the atmosphere, the size could be more moderate to keep the private cozy feel but you win some ya lose some.

REVIEW #10:  4 stars  (685 chars)
I like this Starbucks even though it's ridiculously busy. In fact, I think this is the busiest one in the state...or something like that.  ...  ... I usually go through the drive-thru when I go here. I like the fact that they have a drive-thru because I'm too lazy, at times, to get out of my car and go in. Fair warning though...the drive-thru can get really backed up sometimes, so it's probably quicker to park and go inside. ...  ... Working the drive-thru can be challenging because some of the drinks sound alike. I know if I worked it I wouldn't be able to tell the difference between a machiato and an americano...so props to the drive thru workers who never screw my order up.

REVIEW #12:  4 stars  (427 chars)
like any good ol starbucks, it's right near work/home/commute/gym/etc.  ... i'm a fan of the strong yet bitter taste of starbucks. we buy their bags of coffee at the supermarket and then take our empty bags in for free coffees.  ...  ... this location always has a friendly staff and the it's usually pretty busy with alot of hospital folks or people trying to look important on their laptops or ipads.  ...  ... yay starbucks.

The line was a little long but worth the wait! The staff was very friendly. This is my Starbucks.

REVIEW #14:  4 stars  (458 chars)
This is a Starbucks. That means certain expectations and almost identical menu. This is an incredibly busy store. It is a rare moment in the morning when the drive through is not occupied by more than ten cars. It seems slow service but if you go in there will be a similar line that has slower service... Or so it seems. we have never had a mistake in our service. The staff is always friendly. We keep going. Don't hesitate to trust to the food or service.

REVIEW #15:  4 stars  (1021 chars)
This location is always busy, especially in the morning. It can take up to 20 mins to get through the drive-thru which is never fun when you are trying to get to work on time. And the parking lot situation is terribly done, totally not their fault obviously! But the employees who work there are absolutely awesome!!! When I was in there this morning my card declined and I had no other way to pay for it. She told me to keep my skinny latte and muffin and not to worry about it, it happens. But I swore up and down that I would be back and of course I was later that morning and I left a tip! I'm an honest person but some places would take your drink back and simply throw it away, but they understand their customers are not first timers and will be back! Not saying go there to try this, but its nice to know great people and decent companies still are to be found around the valley! ...  ...  ... *update* I returned to pay my bill and they wouldn't let me pay for it! Apparently it was my 1 millionth visit freebie!

A Starbucks inside a Starbucks.

REVIEW #17:  3 stars  (1176 chars)
As others have noted, this is a very busy place, but for good reason. It's in a fantastic location on Shea Blvd., and the people who work here are incredibly friendly and very hard working, although some of the employees at other nearby Starbucks, such as the one near the Wal-mart by Raintree & 101, are (shockingly) friendlier. It's impossible to get coffee and/or breakfast here in the mornings, though, if you're on your way to work. At 8:30 in the morning they really need to put the most efficient (not necessarily the friendliest) person in front of the cashier counter, and it seems they did quite the opposite. It would also be nice if they could extend the front wall by about 2 feet and put more tables inside. The atmosphere is usually somewhat chaotic, and the music can be just a bit too loud and repetitive, too, but the fact that they even have a lounge chair at which I can park myself with a laptop and chillout for hours on end with free wi-fi I shouldn't complain too much. There aren't any other loungeable coffeeshops very close to this intersection (94th & Shea). UPDATE: Scratch that. Coffee Plantation @ Scottsdale Road and Shea. It's worth the drive.

REVIEW #18:  3 stars  (282 chars)
Instead of going thru the Drive-Thru, I walked in and order Hot Cafe Mocha and light Carmel Frap with both  light on the whip cream. The gal that was making the Frap got lost into what she was making and the whip cream oozing out of the top. My Cafe Mocha seemed to be watered down.

REVIEW #19:  3 stars  (366 chars)
Service was curt, but pleasant and quick.  Grande looked tiny when flat lid was locked into place (I ordered no whip).  Mocha frappuccino was TOO sweet, I could only drink a third of it, the part with the slushy ice, before tossing the rest away (please recycle plastic!).  Thank goodness I only paid half-price during Starbucks' happy hour (May 1st through May 10).

REVIEW #20:  3 stars  (385 chars)
So they took the advice of many of us and revamped the place, putting in more tables, and putting efficient workers in at the cashier in the mornings. Great! Only problem is, the wi-fi doesn't work. There's an "attwifi" router, but it's broken. ...  ... Wi-fi is just not optional anymore. It's 2011. A coffee shop without wi-fi might as well be a coffee shop without any tables. Pass.

REVIEW #21:  3 stars  (389 chars)
Starbucks is Starbucks is Starbucks.  It is nothing special and this one leaves a little to be desired.  At peak times, the wait can be a bit intense.  The staff is not very friendly or enthusiastic.  That being said, this location is the closest to home and on my route to work, so its what happens when my coffee making boyfriend sleeps in late and I'm left to fend for myself in the AM.

REVIEW #22:  3 stars  (1256 chars)
This is one of,  if not the busiest Starbucks I have ever been in.  Being from the State of Washington, I have frequented hundreds of their stores, and generally find them relaxing - comfortable to sit and have a cup of coffee, read the morning newspaper, or browse on my laptop.   ...  ... This is not the place for that. It must be because of its location in the midst of a medical center, offices, shopping center, and the bordering residential area.  The first time I came here, I just happened to find a seat.  Rather than catch up on the news, I simply watched the parade of different people come through. It was fun, but tiring and exhausting in a way, especially when I hadn't had my morning coffee. ...  ... That said, the service was great.  The crew worked hard getting everyone served, and doing it with humor and politeness.  I was impressed how they handled themselves in the bustling and chaotic atmosphere, with customers yelling to be heard, and some not happy about the long lines. ...  ... I have since found a number of locally owned, quiet spots that I prefer for my morning coffee.  But every once in a while I will stop by, just to watch the diverse clientele and the frantic atmosphere. One thing it is great for - people watching!!

REVIEW #23:  3 stars  (548 chars)
This Starbucks is A-OK considering the amount of business they do.  The service is friendly and they are very efficient at making you're favorite caffeinated Starbucks beverage.  I've been to this Starbucks several times and find them to be somewhat inconsistent at making my coffee or cool drink.  I also think they could be more efficient at cleaning up after people leave.  It's sort of a self serve experience after you've given the coffee barista's you're money. ...  ... But then again it's Starbucks, so may be I shouldn't expect too much...

REVIEW #24:  2 stars  (323 chars)
This has got to be the messiest Starbucks I've ever been to.  I don't know if its just because it is small, but it is very cluttered.  Every time I've gone in there, inventory boxes seem to be just lying around.  I've had a few rude baristas in the drive-thru, a few pleasant ones.  Overall this location is just a bit meh.

REVIEW #25:  2 stars  (448 chars)
This is by far one of the worst Starbucks.  The place is very busy and while the servers are quick they are far from polite.  Usually when drink errors are made Starbucks is more than willing to fix it but here the staff are almost combative.  Everytime I have gone here too it is as if the ac is broken.  The interior is warm and stale.  It makes you long for the chipolte next door.  Bottom Line: SKip this SB and head across the lot to Chompies.

REVIEW #26:  2 stars  (538 chars)
This place is so freaking busy all the time! The only reason I am giving it 2 stars is because its overpriced and Im not a fan of waiting 20 minutes for a cup of joe every time! Not to mention my bucket of energy is always drained from all of the miserable customers that go to this location! It could just be that Snotsdale is not for me! If you enjoy being around miserable people who all have sticks where the sun dont shine and enjoy adding people to their miserable energy then GO HERE! Otherwise its just like every other Starbucks!

REVIEW #27:  2 stars  (606 chars)
This Starbucks gets some of the worst marks for service, correct drink order and overall friendliness.  I normally don't expect to hear: "yeah, what do you want?" from the Barista who clearly wasn't having a great day before I stepped up to the counter. ...  ... This store is way too small for the area and tempers seem always to be short here.  The drive-thru doesn't make any sense since it's location only creates a traffic jam.   ...  ... BTW, does anyone really go here to Chipotle?  Starbucks!  Buy them out and reconfigure the location. ...  ... Sorry, I try to avoid this location like the plague.

REVIEW #28:  1 stars  (326 chars)
Im bummed that I couldn't make a return without a receipt for a mug I got as a gift. I was going to put the credit towards a double steel walked travel mug but now I've got to figure out what to do with this one. Perhaps another location will allow it.  It's possible this is a company policy, but I find that hard to believe.

REVIEW #29:  1 stars  (238 chars)
The drive-thru at this location is not unlike the Apapa-Oshodi Expressway. ...  ... *The Apapa-Oshodi Expressway, the gateway to Nigeria's two busiest seaports, Apapa and Tin Can Island, is home to the worst chronic gridlock in the world.

I can't, for the life of me, remember the Barista who assisted me, but she was HILARIOUS and fun!  I would come back just for her customer service.  She was a little short blondie.   ...  ... The customer service was great.  It is located near a frozen yogurt place as well. Win!  Win!

If you make chai tea lattes, they will come! At the very least, I'd show up for sure, lol! ...  ... This location is small, has some indoor seating and outdoor seating.  ...  ... Service is friendly, but they always seem to be training new batistas when I visit of late & the wait time to get my drink (not order) seems to be higher than in most other locations.  ...  ... The drinks are as great, as always :)

REVIEW #5:  4 stars  (882 chars)
This is a very nice quaint little Starbucks with some nice outdoor seating near the Surprise Stadium. We met up with a friend from SoCal who was in town the same times as us and came here after the game to just chill.  ...  ... The staff was very nice. We placed our orders. It was a pretty quiet Friday night approaching closing time. We were very happy to find that even in this part of town, closing time for the Starbucks was 11pm. We though for sure that, since everyone in this area had already been in bed for 3 hours,  they would tend to close earlier. Thank goodness no.  ...  ... I ordered a tea and was very happy to find that they had honey to put in it.  SG ordered a decaf frap. They were just as good as any other starbucks and perfect for what we had in mind.  ...  ... Oh, and the bathroom was very clean. A key point when you are drinking lots of tea or coffee....

REVIEW #6:  4 stars  (328 chars)
This Starbucks is close to my work, so I'm in here on a regular basis. Though it can be busy at certain times in the morning, the staff is always friendly and they work hard to get everyone's orders out as quickly as possible.

Yes, it's a Starbucks... what's there to Yelp about, you may wonder?  ...  ... The staff. They're friendly and welcoming; they're prompt; and they're accurate. I frequent many locations, and have come to really appreciate these qualities. Great job, kudos to the team at this one!

REVIEW #8:  3 stars  (468 chars)
Seating inside is very limited, there was more outside however hopefully you like the sound and view of traffic from Grand. Staff is friendly however they didn't seem like they know what they were doing. Plus they messed my order up, ordered a tall chai tea and got charged for the grande, I tried to explain but he didn't seem to know the difference. Not the Starbucks you want to come to if your trying to read a book or study a bit, it's more of a social Starbucks.

Starbucks coffee: you know what to expect. ...  ... Surprise: Always something interesting going on. ...  ... Combine the two: one jam packed starbucks that is way too crowded.  I do not think it would be possible to find a seat that was not occupied by a geek-squader using a laptop.

REVIEW #11:  3 stars  (324 chars)
Starbucks...what can one expect...the coffee is decent. What makes each one different than another is the employees. This one has okay morning staff but much better evening staff. Not a very spacious place to hang out, so if it's busy, there will most likely be little room to sit and it will be cramped if there is seating.

REVIEW #12:  3 stars  (404 chars)
Stiff competion from the other 2 starbucks near by.   ...  ... Employees are nice, but I often forget about this location since it is hidden from the street view and this intersection in surprise is such hell, I rush past everything in this corner. I hate trying to get out of this parking lot, be it onto bell or onto grand. ...  ... There's one right across the way inside of B&N... i usually go there.

REVIEW #15:  2 stars  (516 chars)
I've never been a huge fan of this particular Starbucks location, the coffee is almost always lackluster and the shop just seems messy. On my last visit, which was about 2 weeks ago, a young man maybe around 19 was working as the barista and couldn't seemed to be bothered because he was busy flirting with some young girls that we're hanging out there. I just had a tall cup of coffee which was burnt... Needless to say I won't be going back and instead I'll be going to the Barnes and Noble cafe across the street!

REVIEW #17:  2 stars  (735 chars)
This particular Starbucks has some very friendly barista's however you're positive experience at getting a tasty cup of you're favorite caffeinated beverage and doing some light reading or surfing Yelp stops there unfortunately.   ...  ... They are very inconsistent at making their drinks.  They seem to have different people working each time I visit.  Their is nothing worse than spending TOO MUCH money for a cup of coffee already, let alone have it made wrong with either too much ice, not enough coffee or too much water...  Argue... ...  ... Another note, they need to focus more on cleaning their table/chair area for their customers. It was so dirty I could not stay and enjoy my watered down, over iced, not tasty beverage...

REVIEW #18:  1 stars  (746 chars)
funny how one bad experience leads the way for all the others to fall into place. ...  ... the staffing here is terrible.  two people on register, one making drinks...and the ones at the register are clueless.   ...  ... i gave the girl 5 dollars to add on to my starbucks card and we purchased two drinks.  she essentially pocketed 5 dollars because of her incompetence.  I had 6 something pre existing on my gold card and my total came out to 9 dollars.  somehow she ended up charging me twice and because the website does not reflect pre existing balance after your transaction is complete, I can't go back and try and get my money back.  and when I mentioned something, she said, no.  you owe more. ...  ... NEVER AGAIN!! TRAIN YOUR CASHIERS!

REVIEW #19:  1 stars  (887 chars)
This location is the worst around. The baristas were rude and pushy with their products. When I refused to buy their nasty tea or over priced coffee the cashier became overly sarcastic and short with us. ...  ... While waiting for our drinks, the baristas loudly bad mouthed a coworker and one even went as far as to talk about cutting the hated girl's hours so they didn't have to work with her as much. Not professional, not impressive, just plain rude and off-putting. ...  ... The inside dining area is small, crowded, and disgusting. The girls could spend less time talking trash about their fellow coworkers and more time doing what they're being paid to do.  ...  ... The outside dining area is mismatched (not in an attractive way) and is reminiscent of walking through crap at a yard sale.  ...  ... I won't be returning here and I won't be recommending this location to anyone.

REVIEW #20:  1 stars  (891 chars)
We have been to this location before and decided to give them another chance.  Wrong.  Same as before, it took forever for the girl at the cash register to ring us up, she forgot both of the food items we ordered.  Finally we sit down to wait for our coffee, I get mine pretty quickly, however it took way to long to make my boyfriends drink, which was less complicated then mine.  5 other customers received their drinks before he did.  I didn't really understand what the problem was, our drinks should have been ready at the same time.  1 lousy cashier, 1 person making drinks and 1 loud mouth female talking and laughing so loudly, we left because of the conversation she was trying to carry on with one of her co workers.   The first time we went to this location, we stood at the counter for quite awhile without being acknowledged.  We definitely will find another location next time.

Not sure why this location has such low ratings! I've been through the drive-thru at least a dozen times and never leave dissatisfied (other than when they're out of blueberry scones). The service is always friendly and the line typically moves pretty fast. My only complaint would be that they've overfilled my drinks on multiple occasions... I'm not a fan of sticky hands.

This location has a drive through and a lobby ... I have never had an issue parking in their lot ... The lobby has both comfortable chairs and less comfortable chairs ... Right next to Potbelly's so if you are studying and want a sandwich you can pretty much just step outside, ... The drinks are made to standard, and the people who work there are nice. ... One less star because although the people who work there are nice, they are not very knowledgable and that is kind of irritating. ...  ... Otherwise I am a fan, indeed!

REVIEW #4:  2 stars  (288 chars)
This starbucks doesn't live up to the standard of the starbucks name. Each time I have been there my drink has either been made wrong or poorly. The location doesn't seem to be prepared for their morning rush. I make the extra drive down rural to go to another starbucks to get my coffee.

I work near here, so it's the most convenient place to get coffee when you're hungover and already 5 minutes late. But every time I go in I wonder why I had. ...  ... Starbucks' coffee isn't really that good for the most part, but I've definitely had some good baristas that know how to make a good latte. The baristas here however, are obnoxious teenagers who don't know/care what they're doing. It's dirty and hectic, and they're always throwing empty pitchers around and sighing heavily at the STRESS of it all. You probably won't be addressed for a few minutes when approaching the register, as the girl will be frantically stirring some frappuccino mix and mumbling to herself about how much she hates her life. ...  ... At least the coffee's been hot every time I've been in here. But guys. Relax a little.

REVIEW #3:  2 stars  (205 chars)

On Thanksgiving morning my husband and I wanted to make our one-and-only outing for the day a stroll to our nearest Starbucks. I go to a different Starbucks near my office on a daily (sometimes twice daily) basis. On this day, I order my usual non-fat latte and was disappointed at the flavor, or lack of, to be more accurate. It had little to no espresso taste, and was not the right temperature. I told the barista that my latte was not up to par (compared with what I get every day at another store) but received no acknowledgement or apology. She promptly made me another (again no acknowledgement or apology) which tasted exactly the same - blah.  I then conveyed my displeasure with the order taker, even offering to pay for another just to have it made correctly. Now I was getting somewhere, as she finally explained her awareness of a problem with their machine, and has been waiting for some time for management to do something about it. I'm not sure why she didn't explain this in the first place. In any case she (the order taker not the original girl) made me another, which actually tasted superb. So at that point I wasn't sure if it was equipment or server deficiencies, and her explanation left me confused and not sure if I ever wanted to return.

I have been coming to this Starbucks for awhile and there is a reason why. I started out with the drive-thru that has always been fast. Even if there are 10 cars in line, I can count on getting my coffee within 5 minutes max. Way awesome for someone like me who is constantly on a busy schedule. I then went inside one morning when I had extra time and the staff was so friendly! Everyone was engaging, they completely made the best coffee ever! And my breakfast I ordered was just the perfect temp to eat right away. The store manager introduced himself to me as Nicholas and has made a point to say hi to me every morning since I've been back, even on drive-thru. I will always come to this Starbucks, even if it's out of my way!

This is my local Starbucks-- I enjoy the outdoor seating and banana choco chip bread. Usually the baristas are friendly and during one of my last visits the guy behind the counter even gave me a great suggestion when he saw I was struggling to make up my mind. However, during a routine run yesterday morning, I received the worst Starbucks customer service ever (and I'm including the airport Starbucks in that statement too). ...  ... I asked what the Chicken sausage and egg white wrap had in it (besides the obvious) and the flustered barista (there was no one else behind me) replied, "A lot of stuff, I don't know." And just stared. The F? Since it was obvious things weren't going my way, I switched gears and asked for a blonde iced coffee to which he curtly told me "you can't do that, we only make iced coffee one way." Le sigh.  ...  ... Of course, none of this will stop me from coming again but I wish I'd asked that dude, can't we just all get along?

REVIEW #14:  2 stars  (517 chars)
Everyone loves Starbucks, but sadly at this location has terrible customer service. I walked in, no welcome or anything like everyone usually gets. Stood at the counter and the young girl kept waking back and forth, then cleaned out the drain then finally came to the register and said "what would you like?" No how are you or what can I make for you today. Her makeup was completely blacked out eyes, had scars all over her arms and no smile. Definitely wont be returning to this location again. Highly disappointed.

This is a Starbucks location close to home that has a Drive-Thru. It can be a bit awkward if you come from the side of McKellips since it curves to the left if you're ordering coffee via Drive-Thru.  ...  ... Parking lot here is a bit small but usually never have any problems. I haven't had any major issues with my drink orders here; however sometimes it can take a bit longer during the AM hours than the evenings.  ...  ... Free WIFI and there's also patio seating.

REVIEW #3:  4 stars  (489 chars)
A great place to meetup for Coffee and Patries.  It's located right on the border of Scottsdale and Tempe, so it's convenient when I setup quick meetings with clients and colleagues. ...  ... I'm a pretty boring Coffee drinker....99% of the time, I'll order Coffee and drink it black.  On rare occasions I will try something else.  It's a Starbucks.  The Coffee and food is consistent with all of the others I've been to. ...  ... Service here is good as well. ...  ... Return Factor - 80%

REVIEW #4:  4 stars  (534 chars)
Being from out of town and getting in at 3 am. I was so glad to find a Starbucks close to the hotel. Just a short walk away and I was enjoying good coffee and light breakfast items. The only problem is I had to get dressed and make myself semi-presentable.   If you have ever had coffee made from those little 4 cup coffee pots in hotels you would be looking for another venue for coffee too. I have learned that if you are stuck in that type of situation make sure you have some Via with you and add it to the pot. It helps big time.

REVIEW #5:  4 stars  (406 chars)
Great location in South Scottsdale near Tempe, friendly staff and you don't have to wait over 5 minutes for your drinks.  They do have a drive-thru lane if you don't want to get out of your car during hot summer weather or cold winter weather.  Sometimes you might not be able to enter the store from Scottsdale Rd. as there's a bus stop right next to the entrance.  Overall a great location in Scottsdale.

REVIEW #6:  4 stars  (287 chars)
Great location, friendly staff and your typical Starbucks drinks. I don't drink a lot of coffee so I usually have tea and you can't really go wrong with tea :)  ...  ... Mostly female staff in the morning and they are all very nice ...  ... Not very packed as well makes for fast service

This Starbucks is located on a busy street, on a busy corner in Tempe. There are plenty of places to sit outside but who wants to in AZ in the summer right? ...  ... The weekend we were there, the women's restroom had plugged up in a an ugly way but no worries, I tend ot use either one if I have to go so I popped into the men's. ...  ... The place was clean (besides the toilet) very cool and even better, the staff was very cool. It's nice to get your regular drink at a Starbucks and it tastes as good as it does at your fave Starbucks in San Diego...thanks ladies!

REVIEW #10:  3 stars  (288 chars)
I hate going threw the drive-thru is "charles" is the one working the window. He creeps me out. Plus when he is at the window it seems to take FOREVER ... Other than that I am addicted. I am here atleast once a day and usually the people know my order without even having to say anything!

REVIEW #12:  1 stars  (439 chars)
I use this location since it is so close to work. However,  I will no longer be using this location any longer. I have given the store many chances to make up for slow service. ...  ... I typically use the drive thru. I always have a long wait, Friday was the last time I was there and I waited for 10 minutes. I will use the coffee shop across the street (Dunkin Donuts) for now on. The coffee is just as good and they are extremely fast.

REVIEW #14:  1 stars  (331 chars)
The patio is right next to a bus stop and also right next to four lanes of loud traffic. Not sure which is worse, but bus people might take the cake and that includes random homeless dudes shuffling through the garbage while you attempt to enjoy coffee. This location is doomed if your looking for the outdoor Starbucks experience.

I live this location because there is not a crazy line on Saturday mornings and they brew their iced coffee to perfection. As a former sbux employee, I can taste that some other locations don't know how to brew it correctly because it tastes watery :/

REVIEW #2:  5 stars  (484 chars)
Starbucks is my ultimate go-to place for coffee. I don't go there a lot because I can't always afford it, but when I do, it's a treat in itself. Love their specialty drinks and the wonderful customer service I receive each time I go. Also, Starbucks is one place I love receiving gift cards from for the reason of treating myself or just something different from the usual.  ...  ... This location is always quick and reliable and I keep going back because their service is top-notch!

I was in a time crunch and needed a little caffeine to start my day. Drive-thru yeah! Well, if I would have noticed the long long long line in the drive-thru I probably should have opted to go inside or bypass all together. Well, I made it to my destination on time. But a bit stressed. My iced peppermint latte was just what I needed and it was soooooo good. I am used to having Starbucks at the airport and it just never seems to taste right, so I was super happy to have it just like I like it. Thanks for the boost of energy which was needed on this particilar day:)

They were really helpful. The girls behind the counter were really nice. The wait wasn't too long, especially for 8:30 in the morning. When I got my drink the lady wanted me to make sure it tasted good before I left. Very considerate. It was perfect =]

REVIEW #7:  4 stars  (407 chars)
This is my favorite Starbucks in Tempe. Over the past year they have hired some awesome baristas that are much more friendly than what's been around in years past. Plus, I love the trivia they have on the white board behind the espresso machines. It can get busy in there but it's a good mix of students, young professionals and older folks from the surrounding neighborhoods. Lots of patio seating as well.

REVIEW #8:  3 stars  (1723 chars)
Did you know that Starbucks now offers free Wifi?  You no longer have to pay to surf the net here.  Amazing!   ...  ... I've been going to various Starbucks for years.  Surprisingly, I've never been to this location before, because I am usually at Goldbar right across the parking lot. ...  ... Recently, I found out from another Starbucks that they've dropped the charges for thier internet service.  So, since I was a little burnt out on going to Goldbar, I decided to mix things up and come here for a change. ...  ... The interior seating is limited.  Not a whole lot of places to sit, especially if your trying to plug your computer in like myself.  There is seating outside, but I try to avoid it in the summer if I can, even with the spritzers. ...  ... I placed my order for an Arnold Palmer.  After I paid, I sat down at my computer and waited for my drink....and waited some more...and more waiting.  It wasn't until another customer told me that my drink was ready that I was even aware that the drink was done and just sitting on the counter.  I was sitting, literally, right in front of the register!  How could they not have annouced that my drink was ready?  I sat there for a good 5 minutes!  Its hot outside! I'd like my drink! ...  ... Normally, I stand by the bar area and wait for my drink, and they will annouce when its done.  Not here!  Minus points for that, especially considering I was sitting right there! ...  ... Anyways, I will probably be back to this location, but only as a back up to when A) Goldbar is full and I need to get online, or B) when I'm sick of Goldbar and need a change of pace.  These situations happen on a regular basis, and its nice to mix things up every once in a while.

REVIEW #9:  3 stars  (449 chars)
If you don't know what Starbucks has to offer by now you've been living in a cave. If you're looking for something different Gold Bar is way better, and it's located in the same parking lot. I believe in supporting local joints first over huge corporations. If you want the same old thing Starbucks is great. But if you want something new, fresh, fun, and to support a local business, take your money to Gold Bar. I promise you wont be disappointed.

REVIEW #10:  3 stars  (902 chars)
Not great, but not awful. ...  ... This is your typical Starbucks. It's usually pretty average, however the last few times my coffee has tasted burnt. One time, they warned me saying it was the bottom of the batch but the two subsequent times I have not received such a disclaimer. Also, my recent Pumpkin Spice latte tasted strange, and my friend said it tasted like hot chocolate. Not good, but not awful.  ...  ... There is limited seating inside, but the patio makes up for it with various groupings of tables and chairs. I always see folks hanging out and talking - what I like to see at a coffee shop. No drive-thru, which is a let-down, though I like being forced to enjoy the full Starbucks experience sometimes. ...  ... What brings me back is location, my caffeine fix, quick service and a new trivia question on the whiteboard every week!  What is Philematology? The baristas here will know.

REVIEW #11:  3 stars  (296 chars)
Not my favorite location. Stopped in this evening and had to wait about 10 minutes with only one person ahead of me. The barista would take the order, go start on the drink, come back for payment, then finish the drink. Repeat routine for next customer. Inefficient. She was very friendly though.

REVIEW #12:  2 stars  (574 chars)
This is not my favorite starbucks location. Most Starbucks staff are usually over the top bubbly, even in the morning (of course, I would be too if I had a constant flow of caffeine available to me at all times) For some reason at this location, it's like the baristas don't like coffee or something....just not very welcoming people as I have experienced in other stores.  ...  ... One time, they even served me my oatmeal raw.......that's how I know none of them actually drink coffee :/ caffeine wouldn't let you forget a thing like HOT WATER to go in your oatmeal.......

I work right by this location, so I'm in all the time at all hours of the day! They save my life! Often when I come in around 8:30am, the line is at least halfway down the store, but I don't think I've ever waited longer than 15 minutes to get up to the front. Woo! The employees are great and a couple of the guys even remember my name!

I would typically never write a review for strbucks because it is all the same.  I mean that in the best possible way as i have come to expct a certain level of service and quality.  Starbucks is amazing for kids as my dzughter oly drinks warm milk and so anywhere i see a starbucks i can ge a kids milk.  I have had  great serive at this location.  Since i could not find the starbucks at the asu bookstore location, i am using this review too but really the five stars is for this location. I wanted to give the asu location one star.  My barista NOEl today was exceptionaaly rude. She did not know how to make nor ring up a kids drink and when it  came up wrong instead of offering to fix it told me that  is how it is done.  If my other experiences weren t so good with starbucks i would have switched over to petes.  If you happen to be the starbucks manager at the asu bookstore location too, NOEL definitely could use some more training in both drink preparation and customer service. ...  ... Sorry for the spelling areas but i am typing on my iphone and havent found the pellchck option yet.

My morning ritual Monday through Friday is a trip to my local Starbucks.  The employees there are very friendly, knowledgeable and always treat me like family.  They make it a point to know your name and your drink preferences.  We often have our drinks waiting for us when we arrive because they've seen us across the street....now that's service.  What an awesome group of individuals, Starbucks should be proud.

Speedy service, great beverages and super friendly staff. I come here almost every day and I've never been disappointed. I looove the ham and cheese breakfast sandwich, the everything bagel and the caesar salad. The Tazo teas are delicious both iced and hot, and I love the coffee as well. One thing I might add is that I didn't particularly care for the cheese croissant because it was too sweet for me, but I've loved everything else.  :)

REVIEW #7:  5 stars  (373 chars)
This is my favorite Starbucks location! Even when living miles down the road in Mesa, I would drive out of my way to frequent this location. The staff is very friendly and never misses a beat, they even have gotten my order memorized. There is always more than enough space to sit down and get any work or reading done and usually prime space around the electrical sockets.

REVIEW #8:  5 stars  (515 chars)
This is my favorite starbucks probably because I go here about 3 times a week. The staff are also super friendly and know me by name. You can tell they make a point to remember your name and your drink if you are a regular. And they always have a smile on your face and ask about your day. Now parking.. probably isnt the best for this location (wouldnt know because I always walk). There is plenty of seating and the bar is off to the side so you dont have to get your extras around a crowd of people. Keep it up!!

I really like this location. Now, I generally stop by in the morning around 7:45 or so, so this review is probably more for the a.m., not so much how it is in the p.m. ...  ... Service is always fast and the employees are very friendly. Yesterday I ordered a coffee and a breakfast wrap. The coffee came fast, but apparently they had forgotten to warm my wrap. They gave me a voucher for a free drink for having forgotten (it's not like I waited that long, I just had to ask about it, I didn't even complain or anything) ...  ... Anyways, very happy with this location for my morning fix. ...  ... (oh yeah, parking is a problem though. But, usually that early in the morning, you can find parking on the street. The parking meters are free before 8 a.m.)

REVIEW #15:  4 stars  (432 chars)
This is a very unique Starbucks location, and a lot of fun to be at. There is a very diverse crowd there, the layout has more seating than most locations (inside and out), and the feel is very comfortable and interesting. The only issue I have is that the lines are huge there and the way the counter is situated it created a big, awkward bottleneck where you pick up the drinks. If you can deal with that, though, it's a fun place!

REVIEW #16:  4 stars  (394 chars)
This probably some of the greatest service I have had to date from a Starbucks location. I really like the layout of this location. Its spacious. The employees are super friendly and my order was repeated several times instead of just being written on a plastic cup and sat down on the counter. I felt like a real customer. I will definitely be returning to this location for my caffeine needs.

REVIEW #17:  4 stars  (428 chars)
yay, im a fan. Of course it's starbucks, but this one is good. They're quick and pretty friendly. Not overly strange barista types. At night it can be a good place to get some work done as it is decently empty at night. The crowd comes in at lunch and late morning. Early or late enough and you'll have a free spot to get a cup.  ...  ... I'd tell you what I had, but it's starbucks, if you don't know what to order...it's 2012.

REVIEW #19:  3 stars  (626 chars)
I'm a fan of all coffee houses. I like the music, the smell, and the people who congregate at these locations. The best thing to me about this particular location, is the outside 'dining' - you see, I enjoy watching people on there way to things, or coming back from things...or even the few who have not-a-thing going on at all. The Mill Ave Starbucks provides a great venue (and even a good drink here or there). So, on the weekends you might find me sipping a drink and watching the people go by on Mill.  ...  ... P.S. for all those people watchers, the weekends are the best because that is when the real freaks come out!

Nice looking place and friendly staff. ...  ... My only complaint would be all of the non-paying customers that come in and are allowed to stay.  Lots of street people and bums take advantage of the free air conditioning, water, and restrooms but they take up seating and stay all day.  The inappropriate conversations take away from the coffee shop environment and make me uncomfortable at times.   ...  ... Starbucks needs to crack down and offer their services to paying customers only.

Yeah, I'll admit it. I drink Starbucks. I even enjoy it. There goes my indie cred. ...  ... Whatevs. It's coffee, and with their new not-burned-to-oblivion roast, it's better than it used to be. It's also on the way to work and a lot faster than stopping by Cartel. Plus, I can stop in when I take the bus to work, which I can't do with Cartel.  ...  ... That's where the comparison ends, though. No matter how you slice it, Starbucks' coffee is nothing to write home about - it's bland. It's boring. It's...well...Starbucksy. But the baristas are perky, welcoming and efficient. They even make a point to ask about my morning.  ...  ... Why they insist on asking how I spell my name, however, I will never, ever know. ...  ... With an h, without an h, who gives a good goddamn? Will it make the lattes taste like they were made by a person and not a robot? Otherwise, I really don't give a shit what you write on my paper cup. You can call me Ted Kaczynski for all I care. Let me just put up the hood on this sweatshirt and grab my drink and I will be on my way back to my cabin in Montana.  ...  ... I've also been tempted to tell them my name is something ridiculous. Like, "It's Melanie, but with two ee's at the end and a circumflex on the a." Just to see if they'd do it. Or ask what a circumflex is.  ...  ... But you know what, I'm tired of hating on Starbucks. Sure, it's an easy target: too big, too corporate, too friendly. Sure, there's a lot of crappola for sale along with my coffee. And yeah, the pre-packaged food is overpriced. But in the world of corporate behemoths, I could be dealing with a lot worse - in terms of employment practices, environmental practices, trade practices, you name it.  ...  ... Plus, they compliment my outfit and tell me I look pretty. And at 7:30 a.m., I'm a fucking sucker.

REVIEW #25:  2 stars  (605 chars)
If you ever imaged a Starbucks that smelled of sweat socks mixed with caramel and coffee, you've come to the right place.. ...  ... The Starbucks on Mill is easily the smelliest Starbucks in town.  The coffee is still decent because its a Starbucks, but the place just is not great.  I do enjoy the couches when people aren't living on them for 8 hours at a time.  The place is usually packed with people using laptops for the free wifi, and the smell comes from the people off the streets walking in and out of the place.  Dont forget.. t his is Mill Ave.. so all walks of life come here. ...  ... Enjoy!

REVIEW #26:  2 stars  (1329 chars)
Starbucks, you evil little addiction. Before moving to AZ I wouldn't even touch the stuff (was a die hard Dunkies fan for my iced java).  Moved here and the dearth of Dunkies forced my hand to sip some S-bucks.  Fast fwd to today and I'm a balls-out addict.  Evil and odd how that happens. ...  ... I get my morning fix at the 7th St location (see my review here: http://www.yelp.com/biz/starbucks-coffee-phoenix-4#hrid:sO9RZ18XimUtEGPIWtbSwQ/src:self ) but as I work on Mill Ave I sometimes need an afternoon re-fill and patronize the Mill Ave location.  The product's the same as every other Starbucks in the world, so what differentiates one location from another?  The staff and service, and herein lies my issue. ...  ... Just about everyone who works here is great, but man alive you guys are so slow sometimes.   I walk 2 1/2 blocks from my office to come here and the entire round-trip affair is a painstaking half an hour!!  How can this be?  I understand that you're a high foot traffic location (right off campus and city hall), but I recommend you drink your own Kool-Ade, do a shot of espresso (Yes Virgina, there's NO "X" in espresso), and put some pep in your step!! ...  ... Again, I have to reiterate that the staff here is super friendly and accommodating, I just wish it didn't take so long to re-fuel my tank.

REVIEW #27:  2 stars  (434 chars)
The Coffee was just okay.  We also ordered a red velvet and a vanilla bean cupcake.  Both had the thickest frosting ever!  Me and the bf looked at each other and asked, "does this cupcake have coffee in it?"  I am not sure if it did or not, but it sort of ruined the traditional flavors of both items.  The cashier was also a wee bit distracted and the barista was not overly-pleasant either.  I've certainly had better in other SBUX.

REVIEW #28:  1 stars  (484 chars)
I came here with my girlfriend before a night on the town.  The clerk acted like a jerk the whole time we were ordering, asking questions with a put-off tone and eventually over charged us for our drinks.  Not only that, but both the drip coffees were clearly old, burnt and disgusting.  After receiving our drinks and taking the first sip, both the baristas started to laugh.  What was wrong with the coffee besides the burnt taste is beyond me but it was a joke I didn't find funny.

REVIEW #29:  1 stars  (482 chars)
This is the worst Starbucks I have ever gone to. They finally got rid of the disgusting couches that were a hang out spot for homeless people, but there is still a seedy crowd that hangs out around the store. The tables are always dirty, there are crumbs and litter all over the floor, the bathroom was gross.... I wish it was enjoyable, because the location would be great for studying. I didn't notice it being any quicker than any other Starbucks. I avoid this store from now on.

REVIEW #30:  1 stars  (586 chars)
This location suffers and benefits from the fact that it is located on Mill Ave. I am sure they appreciate the foot traffic from all the students and office workers but there biggest challenge is the homeless people that crowd the outdoor seating and on cold days interior seating with their dogs and backpacks. When we asked on cashier if dogs were allowed inside she side only service dogs. We have to assume they use the most liberal interpretation of the term service dog or are not willing to confront folks who bring dogs into the restaurant. Overall it in not the cleanest place.

REVIEW #31:  1 stars  (257 chars)
While coffee is decent as Starbucks can be. The help has attitude. The place was burning up hot inside and when I asked if they had a/c I was told rudely by the barista " I burn up every shift. "  putting a much more sour taste than the coffee in my mouth .

So far so good! I visit a couple times a week (okay...maybe several times a week), and they have gotten it right every time. Much better than the location by Whole Foods, which always smells like a sewer, and the location by Fry's that will charge you for every customization (I didn't say add, I said substitute!). I had asked about a custom drink that was displayed on a special sign that highlights employees' creations. Although those employees weren't working that day, the baristas on shift tried a couple experiments, giving us free samples - so awesome!!! This is my new spot - big thimbs up.

The external environment does not do the building any justice as to how big it is inside. It's very modern inside with a touch of that old coffee house chic furniture.  ...  ... My order came out perfect. Great location but a little hard to get into.  ...  ... I would definitely come back to this location

REVIEW #6:  3 stars  (361 chars)
Beware of the freshly minted baristas not knowing the difference between leaving "room" in an Americano and throwing the already diluted Americano down the drain to make "room." I'm more interested in the flavor an extra shot will make with less water than the volume of a full cup. And then to remedy the "room" request by throwing it away defeats the purpose.

REVIEW #7:  3 stars  (234 chars)
I love the decor of this new Starbucks. The service is lacking though. There are a hand full of good employees but most are young and rude. I am not sure why. The one across the street is much better. This one is just more convenient.

REVIEW #8:  3 stars  (492 chars)
Seven workers in the morning at 8 a.m. And I still have to wait 3 minutes before being served - one person at the register in front of me. ...  ... Where does the line start where does it end I don't know.  In front of the cashier, or the other end of the treats.   ...  ... It's a small clean shop serving Starbucks fare with a drive thru a drive thru that's going to be prone to traffic jams for the people parking.   ...  ... It's a starbucks - oblivious to the dropping coffee bean prices

REVIEW #9:  3 stars  (123 chars)
Trendy, small location who that mainly caters to drive-thru customers. The place is super clean and the restrooms are also.

REVIEW #10:  2 stars  (102 chars)
Not efficient servicing both the front and drive thru in the busy morning hours. Poor service overall.

REVIEW #11:  2 stars  (593 chars)
Went to this location for my usual iced tea before work and thought I'd beat the drive thru line and walked in. That was my mistake. I had one person in front of me, yet it took 5 minutes for them to take my order and somehow 15 minutes to pour my tea. I probably would've gotten through quicker if I'd chosen to be the tenth car in drive up. Not impressed with the inability to juggle the in store customers with the drive up especially considering it took a few minutes to even get the attention of the staff just to get one cashier. I'll definitely be going to the location down the street.

Being a recent convert to the green empire, I've been enjoying the variety of drink selection and quality of product. The staff is beyond friendly, very prompt, and always delivers excellent service. Because of this and the clean, new redesign of the store this has definitely become my favorite Starbucks location in Tempe.

REVIEW #2:  5 stars  (334 chars)
Free WiFi and a Carmel Macchiato are really two things you can't beat. Your bound to run into a friendly face or three here. The staff is always pleasant and remembers my name. If your writing a screenplay, editing your latest mix tape, showing off your apple products or just a general hipster, you know this is the place to be seen.

REVIEW #3:  5 stars  (187 chars)
Hard to find, in Whole Food lot. All the great bakery items you'd expect from Starbucks. My sausage egg and cheese breakfast sandwich was hot, quick and tasty. Quick and friendly service.

REVIEW #4:  5 stars  (719 chars)
I normally don't write reviews for Starbucks but this one deserves some kuddos. I'm here a lot waiting for my wife to finish at ASU. I do all kinds of writing here...yeah I'm there a lot :) ...  ... If I want to go to Starbuck's, I try to make it this one. Especially if I want a frappuccino. For some reason, these people just know how to make it right. They are friendly here and quick. If you come there somewhat regularly they usually know your name and drink. Not to bad for a chain store. While I prefer local coffee houses, I found myself here a lot this semester. I was very pleased. Probably one of the best starbuck's I've been to in tempe. And they have a lot of comfortable seating...not just wooden chairs.

REVIEW #5:  5 stars  (385 chars)
I'm not typically in this area but found myself in south Tempe after a morning appointment. With about 10 people ahead of me in line, I knew I had hit rush hour and figured I would be waiting quite a while. To my delight, I didn't wait in line more than a couple of minutes, was helped with a smile and my drinks were out within another 5 minutes. Wish I lived closer to this location!

REVIEW #6:  5 stars  (244 chars)
My favorite Starbucks in the valley. The actual location is nice and big. The staff learned my name and order quickly and they always manage to work through the line in a timely manner (the way to this girl's heart at 7am on a weekday morning).

REVIEW #7:  5 stars  (571 chars)
This is one of my favorite starbucks. The people that work here are great! They work quickly and lines go by quick and their super sweet. I love the ample seating and tons and tons of plugs. tons. :D doesn't it make you disappointed when there's nowhere for you to plug in your lappy? well, not here! ...  ... I like to come here and study. keeps me focused and the coffee keeps me awake. Also, it's right in the shopping center with whole foods, jimmy johns, qdoba, pita shack, mcdonalds and it's across from smashburger and chipotle. something for every study buddy. :D

I do not often go out to Coffee, but at times you just need to. In the Summer I only drink it in the morning.  Even then it makes me too hot. ... So I thought I would give a nice iced coffee a try since it was mid day. I like these things sweet. so I love that Starbucks had raw Sugar.  ... I like heavy cream and Raw Sugar, so that is what I like and they have it! ... Friendly staff, nice clean place.

REVIEW #12:  4 stars  (186 chars)
I love this Starbucks. We all know every Starbucks is expensive, so forget that. But these people have our drinks memorized, if you go there alot anyways, they're on top. Good Starbucks.

REVIEW #13:  4 stars  (679 chars)
The barista that's there at 5:30 am is the best, she's always cheerful and reminds me to come back in a few hours for my .55 cent refill.  I try my damnedest to get back there but I get busy and forget.  She's really nice, I try to get in her line whenever possible.  There's another barista, that rolls their eyes at me when I order an "extra large" iced coffee and they go out of their way to tell me its a "trenta" or some bullshit like that.  Look, I know you like to give your sizes cute Italian names but I was born in the good ol U S of A and last time I check, you were born in Seattle, Starbucks.  So lets not act all hoity toity when someone places an order in English.

REVIEW #14:  4 stars  (822 chars)
The staff here is very laid back and calm. My experience at some Starbucks is they are ran by crazy high strung people that try so hard to please you it comes off as forced or even creepy. These guys get your in get you out and no drama. I love it. I spend hours here reading and never have been bothered by the staff. There is another location just across the road.... go there if you like loud misbehaving misfits! I have no complaints here. Yes it can be busy.... but what place isn't anymore? I feel right at home here. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is they recently changed the seating inside and to me it is less comfortable. They took away the nice leather seats and added a community style table top. They are probably trying to get people like me to leave sooner.... but they have to try harder than that!

REVIEW #15:  4 stars  (99 chars)
This Starbucks always seems to have fun swag...more than that of it's surrounding Starbucks family.

REVIEW #16:  4 stars  (387 chars)
Went to this location with friends on the way to the NASCAR race and the employees here were fast and very accomodating. My friends no sooner ordered and their drink were RIGHT THERE! Speedy service, nice & clean shop. The only drawback I saw is there's not any signage telling you where the place is, as the location is set back in a shopping center and if you blink, you would miss it.

REVIEW #17:  3 stars  (282 chars)
Friendly staff, overpriced coffee.  ...  ... The product is always consistent but with consistency at this level you are sure to experience a more expensive product that just isn't worth the price. But hey, who doesn't already know that? ...  ...  ... At least there's free Wi-Fi...

REVIEW #18:  3 stars  (193 chars)
Returned here again after 2 years.   ...  ... The place hasn't changed.  The coffee hasn't changed. ...  ... The people working in it have changed for the better. ...  ... Upgrading the rating.

REVIEW #19:  3 stars  (377 chars)
The staff here is always very friendly and helpful. Unfortunately, they run out of things very quickly. Today they were out of bagels, regular cream cheese, and coffee stoppers before 11 am. It's never fun finding out AFTER you order and pay for something that it's unavailable. I wish their stock was as consistent as their service, but I'm not going in there for the service.

REVIEW #20:  2 stars  (1339 chars)
The beauty of Starbucks is their ability to custom make such a large variety, the downside is that they have such a large variety of possible permutations of coffee and tea drinks. I find this store gets the the order right about 50% of the time. ...  ... For the 3rd time this week they got it wrong today. A Quad Grande Americano with Room should result in a nice thick Americano with a robust taste. ...  ... Yesterday I only got three shots which is quite obvious and only discovered by me after merging onto the frwy and taking my 1st sip. Like on Monday, today there was no room - it was full to the top. That one or two ounces more water dilutes the taste.  ...  ... The barista offered to pour out the extra! Eh? I could have done that. I told him I was more concerned about the taste not the volume. If you pour some out I lose the extra espresso shot I paid for. ...  ... The system of noting what you want lacks for consistency. The person who took my order was busy trying to upsell me a lb of coffee to take home.  The cashier who I again repeated my order to ignored my plea to make sure that it had "room". As I look at my cup now, it has no notation on it at all so the barista was not the problem.  ...  ... Why do I still go there? Because it's less than a 1/4 mile from my house and when they get it right, it's so good.

***Kiddos, if you're reading this right now, take if from me, you're gonna want to go visit the Hannah Montana website or check out the new dirt on that Zoe 101 star who got knocked up by her producer or some such nonsense because that's a hell of a lot more wholesome that what's about to follow. But if you want to learn a new curse word or two to awe your peers on the playground, keep reading. Who am I kidding? Kids don't read any more. There aren't enough flashy graphics on this page to keep the interest of those ADHD spider monkeys. So with that in mind... ...  ... I don't usually write reviews about chain establishments, but I've got a big glass of hater-ade (venti nonfat whothefuckknows) at my side this morning and I just gotta unleash the fury before it implodes and consumes me.  ...  ... Ahem. ...  ... Fuck Starbucks. ...  ... Fuck them and the flea ridden ass they trotted in on.  ...  ... By some twist of fate, probably engineered by Loki, I ended up with forty dollars in gift cards to this black hole of mass consumerism and corporate greed. But far be it from me to let free money go to waste, so I've been dashing in the past few days to burn these credits as fast as plastic trees can burn. The past three visits have reinforced everything I've come to know and hate about this piss poor chain of mediocre, overpriced coffee, distilling my hatred into a seething mass of vile, putrid ichors that have accumulated somewhere in the region of my appendix. I'm in a dark, dark place right now folks. ...  ... Fuck the pretentious pidgin Italian that's the closest suburban soccer moms are ever going to get to that European vacation. Tall? Venti? Grande? I'll take a fucking medium, douchetard. ...  ... Fuck the burnt beans that leave the acrid taste of corporate semen in the back of your throat. Open up wide because they're about to unload right into your willing and waiting mouth, and you're going to pay them to do it. ...  ... Fuck the people that order a grande half-caf nonfat pumpkin spice cappuccino, dry, extra hot, two pumps white chocolate, one pump sugarfree hazelnut. Translation: You're an asshat and I'm late for work, so get your five hundred calorie monstrosity out of my fucking way before I "accidentally" knock it all over your god damn pumps, you frigid bitch. The amount of time it takes you to order your drink at Starbucks is proportionate to what a demanding, micromanaging cuntbucket you must be in real life. It's fucking coffee. Like fucking Taco Bell, there are only so many ingredients they can mix and match to create new and zany combinations. Add espresso, cut with a mixer, add syrup. Presto chango. You have an eight dollar cup of joe. ...  ... Fuck the people that hang out at Starbucks too. This morning the fucking place was packed wall to wall with affluent suburbanites in their business casual reading newspapers, playing on their laptops and sipping shitty coffee. You've gotta have some place better to be. No? Really? Your life is so dull and predictable that Starbucks is the hippest most happening place you can think of to waste an extra half an hour of prime snooze time? You know what, I can't even rip on you. That's depressing. You're spiraling downward in a haze of bitter java, suffocated by the oppressive blanket of corporate familiarity and clonelike oneness. I'll let you reside in your little coffee coffin a bit longer, free of ridicule. Unless you're the bastard with a ten part order. Then the gloves come back off.  ...  ... And fuck the stale baked goods and prepackaged luncheon fare at Starbucks. I had a bagel. It was hard as a rock and dryer than your mom's...I'm gonna censor that one. I had an overpriced fruit and cheese plate. Mealy apples and cheddar atop a bed of lettuce, with a wedge of brie to show you they're 'gourmet.' Suckfest. Breakfast sandwiches that I'm sure must have been display models because they bared an eerie resemblance to rubber, cardboard and sawdust. Industrial, mmm. I've also had the donuts. How on earth do you fuck up a donut?! Somehow they managed. Sensing a trend here? Cuz I'm just about beating you over the head with it. Everything offered at Starbucks is the same shit you can get at Circle K for half the price, except it's wrapped in a shiny plastic package and distributed en masse to the overweight gullets of Americans everywhere. ...  ... Know what the kicker is?  ...  ... I had to manually add this location.  ...  ... Five fucking pages of Starbucks locations in the Greater Phoenix Metro Area and I had to go and add another.  ...  ... So fuck Starbucks.

REVIEW #22:  1 stars  (563 chars)
The Coffee - standard starbucks. ...  ... The People that work here?  Zombies ...  ... I've been coming here for 6 months and order the exact same 'ordinary' thing, and NOT ONCE have that remembered what I order.  It's a friggin coffee - plain - same size every friggin time. ...  ... One visiting this location should not expect any "hospitality", "emotion", "intelligence", "warmth" or any normal service that one would get at a more personal cafe. ...  ... Get your coffee and leave - and remember, the coffee isn't THAT good anyway. ...  ... This place sucks.

REVIEW #23:  1 stars  (237 chars)
The only Starbucks I know that can screw up an Americano every time. I ask for room and they fill to within 1 mm of the lid then suggest that I pour the excess off when I complain. My goal is taste not volume, is that hard to understand?

REVIEW #24:  1 stars  (488 chars)
What a mess! I get it...its a coffee shop and not sure why they wouldnt be ready or more organized for morning rush. i walk in and order my drink. i checked and they showed that the Blonde roast was out but they could do a pour over.  no thanks...just dont show it available.  After waiting for second coffee to be made...i was wondering when i would get my regular brewed coffee and pastry.  i had to go back to the register for that becauae the window did not have anything else for me.

I love this mini Starbucks! It's right near my pad and it has a drive through that moves fast -- thankfully. And the people who work at this location are characters. Sometimes the baristas will sing to you before they take your order or they'll tell you a joke. This is seriously the wackiest group of people I've ever encountered at a Stabucks, but I love it. And the store manager happens to be the talented singer and keyboardist from hot up-and-coming AZ pop-rock act The Loveblisters. ...  ... I highly recommend the White Chocolate Frappachino if you need a jump start in the mornings. The Orange Creme Frap is nice in the afternoons when you need something refreshing in this triple-digit summer heat. And if you're hungry, the lemon loaf is out of this world.

REVIEW #2:  5 stars  (992 chars)
Ok, let's get this straight right off the bat.  I don't think Starbucks makes the best coffee around, but it's consistant and I really like that.  That was especially important when I used to travel constantly for work.  I knew what I liked and it would be the same no matter where I went.  Anyway, I drove through this Starbucks yesterday morning after dropping my sweet pea at akido because I had been up since 4:00 am and needed a little caffeine and sugar.  I ordered a iced soy mocha, a big treat for me because I'm trying to stay away from refined sugar and animal proteins, and waited my turn to make it around to the little window.  All in all I'd say I was inline for about five minutes.  Nothing unheard of for a Saturday morning.  When I got to the window the girl handed me my drink and said it was on them for the long wait!  That just made my day!  How considerate of them.  The mocha hit the spot and gave me enough energy to run the rest of my errands.  I'll be back for more.

REVIEW #3:  5 stars  (736 chars)
These guys are awesome - relentlessly polite, friendly, upbeat. My pup and I drive through each morning, and they know my drink order, and my dog's name, by heart. ...  ... This is a really busy location at certain times of day, so the car line can sometimes be long, but I always see them working as fast as they can, and they've given me a free coffee on several occasions when the wait was too long. ...  ... NOTE: There's a new Starbucks policy that you have to steam milk individually for each drink now (where relevant), you can't steam a pot in advance and pour it as needed. This makes for a fresher drink, but slows down the line. Not the fault of they guys on the front line... ...  ... Awesome Starbucks team here - love 'em.

REVIEW #4:  4 stars  (1297 chars)
hmmm.....some interesting reviews for this location..... well, I have to put my two cents in because I actually would like to give this location some props! For some reason, today everyone decided to get coffee at *exactly* the same time, 11a.m. (weird time for a coffee break, in my opinion...then again, I was there too, wasn't I? humf....) The drive thru lane was looonnngggg.....even the walk up window looked crowded, tho to my surpirse, I didn't have to wait more then 5 minutes to actually order AND receive my drink! All this AND the guy at the window  (who was quite friendly, btw) told me that today they had a 21 personnel meeting at that location and they were also right in the middle of changing shifts. Bad timing for a coffee rush, but very well handled!! ...  ... On a side note, I've never had any problems with the drinks or food at this location. If anything, one time they gave us one too many oatmeals, which we were not charged for and got to keep. I will take that kind of mistake anytime! (even if I have no idea what to do with an extra oatmeal.....) ...  ... and yeah, it's in an oddly positioned spot in a small parking lot, but, hey, it just gives us all an opportunity to show off our manners and kindness to each other, right?? (well, AFTER we get our coffee.......)

I go to this location a few times a week to pick up coffee for my coworkers. I usually have a large order and am in a hurry. The employees here always take care of me. There is almost always a line in the drive thru but I never feel like it takes too long. The employees are super friendly and fast. Watch out for people trying to steal your spot in the drive thru line!

REVIEW #7:  4 stars  (411 chars)
I love the drive-through Starbucks! The baristas are always happy to give us whipped cream in espresso cups for our dogs as a treat! One time they even drizzled some caramel syrup over the whipped cream for them. The line usually goes pretty quickly and the staff tends to be REALLY peppy. So much so that I often think that they should lay off their own product :) Usually a nice, efficient experience overall!

REVIEW #8:  4 stars  (339 chars)
I sometimes stop by this Starbucks on the way to work, and I'm always impressed by the chipperness of the employees.  The drive thru line moves pretty quickly, and they've always gotten my order just right.  Even with a 5 or 6 car line, I think it beats parking and ordering at the counter elsewhere - especially when it's 100 degrees out!

REVIEW #9:  4 stars  (356 chars)
Not sure what all the fuss is with the negative reviews but I have always left with an excellent drink made right. ...  ... The drive thru for me has always been super quick but my tip would be to go here around 5:30 in the afternoon. There never seems to be a line or people lurking around.  ...  ... I will for sure be back here. The service is friendly!

REVIEW #10:  4 stars  (377 chars)
Perfect location for me to stop at on my way to ASU.  ...  ... I have had a few instances where my drink is not crafted according to my modifiers but the baristas have corrected it everytime with no hesitation. ...   ... The crew here is always upbeat and pleasant. The speed of service is superb! Do not pass this drive-thru by because of the line of cars, they are very fast.

REVIEW #11:  4 stars  (136 chars)
This is a good Starbucks if you don't want to have to walk in! You can either walk up or drive through, i'd rather just drive up and go.

REVIEW #12:  4 stars  (709 chars)
This Starbucks seemed worthy of a review because it's not your normal Starbucks.  There is no inside.  It's all either walk up or drive through.   ...  ... And you know how Starbucks folks are generally nice, but can run that range from too busy to be more than polite to overly friendly?  Well - these folks are consistently SUPER friendly in the drive through.  It's kinda weird.  And a little too much on those "Just give me my caffeine before I jump through the speaker box" kind of mornings.  Ok, maybe on those mornings it's more me than them as they aren't ever really obnoxious.  But they are just so NICE.  And some mornings, you just don't have the patience for nice.  I'm sure that isn't just me...

REVIEW #13:  3 stars  (255 chars)
I agree with the reviews about the drive through being a pain, and that it took long, but I was very impressed that while we waited we were visited with and had very very friendly service.  The coffee also came our correct and very good.  It hit the spot.

REVIEW #14:  3 stars  (296 chars)
This Starbucks has a drive-thru...a definite perk. I've only been there a handful of times but twice they haven't made my iced tea correctly. When it was done right, it was delicious but it's not a hard order. I prefer my normal location on McClintock and Guadalupe but will come here in a pinch.

REVIEW #15:  2 stars  (1038 chars)
The only reason I go to this location is because it's the closest/fastest drive thru by my house. ...  ... But the staff is rude. In the past 5 yrs Ive seen them go thru several baristas and it seems like their attitudes just keep getting worse and worse. ...  ... Ive had one or two tell me that the fact that i put soy in my mochas is "totally gross", ive had my food given to other walk up customers and been argued w? when i pointed it out, and just this morning my barista at the drive thru gave me my coffee, and card and then slammed the window shut and walked away w/ out giving me my receipt. I waved and finally the other girl saw me and made a face like "Ugh, what now. " (um, hi kids. Us customers, can see you thru your windows.) when the girl came back she said "What." I politely asked her for my receipt, she gave it to me and reslammed the window. ...  ... We get it, you think youre *awesome* just because youre a Starbucks barista.....well youre not. ...  ... For speed, this location gets 4 stars, customer service, 2.

REVIEW #16:  2 stars  (271 chars)
Walk-up is faster and more efficient than drive-thru. I sat for 8 - yes, EIGHT minutes today with two cars ahead of me at 3:00 pm - hardly peak hours. When I got to the window it was another THREE minutes before I was acknowledged... drove away with the wrong drink. BAH.

REVIEW #17:  1 stars  (458 chars)
I hate this starbucks. They take FOREVER!!!!!! Who was the genus who designed this drive through? They can't do both at the same time or something. It always takes forever to get anything. The drive through is a bit quicker than getting out but I prefer not to idle and pollute phx more than it already is. So this place sucks balls and I am not going back again! Never had a really bad person but I did not really notice.  ... HATE THIS PLACE!!! HATE IT!!!!

I'd like to begin this review with a warning...WARNING: Oscar the Grouch works at this location!  ...  ... I pull up to the drive-thru at 5am this morning to order a drink for me and my friend. Little miss Grouchy gets on the other end full of attitude and scorn. She asks for my order and interrupts me as I am in the middle of my statement saying "is that all?" with a snappy tone. Which completely throws me off, I finish my order but can't believe her tone the whole time she is talking with me. I drive around to the window and she got my drink wrong! (maybe she should have LISTENED to the whole thing...any ways I hand back my drink so she can make another one and she slams the drink into the trash and refuses to look at me. She maintains a permanent scorn on her face and when she finally hands me my corrected drink, I say, "thanks, have a good morning." she slams the window on me! I don't have the highest expectations for any drive-thru, but Starbucks always promotes their friendly service and my experiences at other Starbucks have always been pleasent; so I am shocked this Starbucks is still open. When those 100 odd stores closed a few years ago, this one should have been one of them. ...  ... This isn't the first time I have come to this location and had to correct my order at the window, in fact getting my order RIGHT is an exception! I can't believe a company like Starbucks would have stand for such low quality in service.

REVIEW #19:  1 stars  (835 chars)
Well, compared to everyone else, I got a great person at the window, she was not only kind and sweet, but she made terrific conversation, never met anyone as nice. However, the hot chocolate was terrible, i mean, bitter, burnt, gross, and completely un-drinkable. How can you mess up hot chocolate? You have to TRY to get that wrong. More over, i asked for without whipped cream and got some anyways, I hate that. There was a particular reason i asked for without, I wouldn't go out  of my without reason.  ...  ... Also, this is mainly a get your coffee and go type place, only outdoor seating next to a large intersection. Not recommended for a relaxing place. And my experience doesn't mean all the Batistas are as nice as this one individual.  ...  ... Seriously, don't bother with this place though, the one on Mill is far better.

This is the Starbucks located on the 1st floor of the WP Carey School of Business at ASU. It's funny to think that we have our very own Starbucks, considering there is one in the MU which is the next building over. But when you need coffee, you need coffee!!  ...  ... Always quick friendly service. Try to stop by at non-peak times. Sometimes the line can get all the way to the door.

This Starbucks is always a magnificent last minute Caramel Macchiato spot!! The lines here get crazy long, but don't let that stop you from getting your caffeine or tea dose!! There is always plenty of friendly and attentive staff at this spot, knowing that most students in line might be cranky and/or inpatient.  ... You can't say much about Starbucks, other than they pretty much have the queue and processing time management down!! Plus, they offer yummy treats, Ethos water, amazing green, passion and black tea, and a terrific Starbucks Gold Rewards Program!! :)  ...           _   Way to go!!

REVIEW #3:  1 stars  (295 chars)
Ever wonder how there is a line out the door but only one of the four employees bothers to work.  I've watched most of them text and chat behind the counter more than make tasty beverages.  Good location but no surprise again today after waiting almost 18 minutes to place my order.  Good Grief!

Of all the Starbucks I've been to, the ones on this campus are terrible and this Starbucks is the worst. The wait is long because in addition to a line out the door, the staff is completely uncoordinated and generally only one register is open with one person making drinks.  ...  ... Another issue is the one person who IS making drinks is terrible at their job. A request for a splash of milk will result in half of the total volume of your drink being milk. To my knowledge, it is only at this location where 'splash' is equivalent to 'au lait.'  ...  ... Finally, their prices are higher by 5 to 15% of actual Starbucks locations, and they do not utilize any of the green or gold card rewards - so you cannot get your free coffee or free refills as you can at all other locations. ...  ... To quote another yelp review, "The convenience of the location being right on campus is NOT worth going to with services like this." If I could give this location zero stars, I would.

REVIEW #5:  1 stars  (685 chars)
This Starbucks is terrible. The wait is long which I do not mind being a patient person in this regard however after having waited so long in a line out the door you would expect a descent drink in compensation; this is not the case at all. Each time I've gone I have been disappointed with the quality of my orders. It is also frustrating when just about everyone after you in the line get their drinks before you and I can literally see the disarray and confusion on the employee's faces while they worked, not the place for me, these guys have really got to get their act together. The convenience of the location being right on campus is NOT worth going to with services like this.

a perfectly perfect starbucks.  :) ...  ... this starbucks is on my way to the office.  easy access from the freeway, and super fast service. ...  ... morning rushes for AM coffee create a wrap around in the drive through, but the staff is aware and works quickly.  Even if cars are coming out the end of the drive through, it takes about a minute a care.  Yes, i've timed it. ...  ... my toffee nut americano with non-fat milk is consistent in flavor and i always get a stopper in my drink.   ...  ... thanks starbucks for being sensitive to my AM time restraints...and for making me yummy drinks visit after visit!

REVIEW #2:  5 stars  (455 chars)
Between this one and the one on Rainbow and Warm Springs, this location is my favorite for when I'm heading to school or work. The drive-thru line tends to get long, but the service is much faster than the Rainbow location.  ...  ... Also, I feel like they have a magical green tea latte wizard at this location. This is the ONLY location that mixes my green tea lattes perfectly- they don't leave me with chunks of green tea that I accidentally choke on.

REVIEW #3:  5 stars  (513 chars)
For some reason it's always a great Starbucks that gets me on a Yelping roll after a couple months hiatus.  ...  ... I am always impressed when a specific store of a large chain provides excellent customer service and this particular Starbucks has renewed my faith in Las Vegas Starbucks as a whole! All the employees have been super friendly and efficient and the drinks at this location just taste better and stronger. I'm glad that I have something to look forward to in the mornings before work again! Thanks!

REVIEW #4:  5 stars  (328 chars)
I don't normally review chains like Starbucks, but after today, I figured I needed to do so. Service is always fast and friendly. My drinks are always perfect. Today I overheard a manager telling the employees about how they keep everything clean and disinfected. So... Fast, friendly, and really really clean? My kind of place.

REVIEW #5:  5 stars  (342 chars)
I Know Starbucks is a corporate machine but I like their chai tea mix and I think they use the brand Oregon chai. Forget the coffee, it's way too strong and gets me strung out like I took a no doz caffeine pill. More about the tea, I order a venti no water soy chai. It's rich and filling because the soy is protein, so it's healthy right! ;P

REVIEW #6:  5 stars  (251 chars)
I love this Starbucks! The staff are down to Earth people and actually connect with their customers! Even though it's a busy place and sometimes hard to find a spot to plug in your laptop, the customer service and drink recommendations are worth it :]

REVIEW #7:  5 stars  (720 chars)
love this Starbucks! It is my go to when I need a cuppa joe when on my way to work.  ... Close to work... bonus! ... Drive thru... bonus bonus!!!  ... But what is priceless.. and keeps me coming back... The Staff! ... Always friendly... and gotta say it is almost like cheers when you pull through the drive-thru and they say "Heya Sharr"  ... (secretly loves this)  ... They also got on board with my Make a Difference Monday! I drive through Monday morning and buy the car's order who is behind me.  ... They get super excited and tell me each week just how many cars bought for the other car behind them ...  ... Makes this location.. my favorite... and must visit . Even after I discover a way to I.V my caffeine in.

REVIEW #8:  5 stars  (355 chars)
They have a video drive thru order screen so that you can see the order taker and they can see you! I think it's weird but I like that they are embracing technology with a human element.  ...  ... Service is always consistently friendly and drinks are made right. What else can you ask for in the morning. Thanks much for my venti no water chai tea latte!

REVIEW #9:  5 stars  (192 chars)
This Starbuck's is friendly and fast. Everything is always made perfect and consistent. They know what they are doing here and are happy. You can tell when the staff are happy where they work.

REVIEW #10:  4 stars  (979 chars)
After having my car serviced at Findlay Chevrolet or travelling from the vicinity of Rainbow at the 215, this is a Starbucks that I'll spend time in. Especially during rush hour. ...    In comparison to it's sister Starbucks, a mile southwest at Rainbow and Warm Springs, the environment is laid back. Regardless, it sits south of the 215 exit at Jones Boulevard, the surrounding area is not too congested. So access to and from the parking lot is not stressful. The parking lot, which is in back of the building is plentiful in spaces. This Starbucks also includes a drive thru. ...    The cafe is on the roomy side. The drawback is the tables are kind of small. Kind of annoying when I share my table with a notebook, diary, coffee, and glasses. ...     Being Christmas season, I go for the drip coffee with pumpkin spices. The egg nog beverages are likewise delicious. ...     I will be making my way to many more Starbucks (and McDonalds, walmarts, cafes, restaurants, etc.).

Bring a jacket if you intend on studying here. This place is an icebox even during the summer.

REVIEW #12:  4 stars  (306 chars)
Extremely fast service even when there was a line in the morning. My drink was done within a minute after I was done paying at the register! I was impressed because other locations usually aren't this fast. Drinks are the same as any other Starbucks...overpriced but packed with delicious caffiene goodness

REVIEW #13:  4 stars  (1190 chars)
The Starbucks on Rainbow and 215 use to be my go-to Starbucks before work.  I have switched over to this one because I found out this is on Jones and 215 which is closer to work.  I love meeting people here about half an hour to an hour earlier before work and just chill...  ...  ... This location is in a business/office plaza so it is quite busy during the weekdays; however, the weekends are not as crowded so I love it.  Sometimes it is quiet and cozy.  The area itself looks very clean and neat so that is a plus factor for me also.  Compared to Rainbow and 215 location, this location is definitely more isolated.  I love that. ...  ... Service-wise, I feel like it is a bit slow.  I always order Grande Iced Americano and it takes a little longer than most other Starbucks I go to.  I have only been here may be 10 times at most... But I guess I was there during busy hours?? I'm not sure.  Most staff are friendly... some seem cranky sometimes, but I don't mind very much.  I've had mostly neutral experiences so far so I'm not complaining. I will go here regardless because of its location. ...  ... So I would definitely recommend people to go to this location if you are nearby.

REVIEW #14:  3 stars  (278 chars)
Awesome customer service. Love the vibe in here. The guy at the register and the gal in the back are hella cool. Even the guy in taking the orders via drive thru is really cool.  ...  ... Its a small spot, but if you don't mind that its a nice spot for a meeting or hanging out.

REVIEW #15:  3 stars  (270 chars)
Dropped by for my venti hazelnut frap but pretty busy. The wait a little too long for my liking especially with a drive thru. It is about 130pm don't think it should take this long at this hour, staff friendly, first time here, I'll give them another chance another day.

REVIEW #16:  3 stars  (674 chars)
Good meeting spot for having coffee and networking with the people who work tirelessly to bring more additional business to the valley of a non-gaming nature. As Starbucks go this is an average size place but it brings together an interesting mix of tech people both from a programming as well as a physical infrastructure disciple. There are the people from the Bikram yoga studio, to the immigration folks, to the professionals that maintain the business park and let's not forget the business development professionals.  ...  ... Eclectic crowd where you will over hear very interesting and diverse conversations. I truly enjoy meeting my business friend here for coffee.

REVIEW #17:  3 stars  (201 chars)
I am not a big coffee gut, but time to time I'll stop in for a pastry and an Izzie drink. ...  ... It's a short review, but I'm not a coffee guy so I don't really have anything to say, it's a starbucks

REVIEW #20:  3 stars  (1182 chars)
This Starbucks has saved me for many countless Mondays, Thursdays ...or whenever I need a a kick in the pants so I can function properly at work. My usual is a tall Skinny Caramel Frappachino but it still has to come with the caramel and the whipped cream. I know ..I know it's self defeating but I need it. If I'm feeling extra rich I will get their Turkey Bacon Sandwich. It is a whole wheat English muffin, egg whites, turkey bacon and cheese. It's really good and it fills me up sometimes past lunch. That's not saying much since my lunch at work starts three hours after I get there. If I ever miss my morning coffee I will never attempt to go back to Starbucks around 9am. because it's like their rush hour. A co worker and I got stuck in the drive through line for our whole lunch break (30min) .When they finally got to us we had to leave back to work empty handed. The lesson here is when in doubt go inside especially if you are on a time schedule. It's better then being stuck in the drive through while your boss is wondering where you are at. That is my only gripe about this place overall they are really cheerful at 6am in the morning and have great customer service!

REVIEW #21:  2 stars  (264 chars)
I come to this location pretty much everyday~ staff is always friendly but the drink I order "venti iced stirred caramel macchiato" they repeat my order and yet again today I was handed "not stirred" and each day the wait at drive thru is getting longer and longer

REVIEW #22:  2 stars  (549 chars)
I feel like reviews for large chains like Starbucks can help people differentiate between the good and the bad. ...  ... I have noticed that this place in particular is pretty inconsistent with the drinks and service. There have been multiple times where I've received the wrong drink. 99% of the time I am going through the drive through, so by the time I realize the mistake, I am so far gone that I can't go back to correct it. ...  ... On the upside, the people here are friendly. I do not recall every encountering a grumpy or rude person here.

REVIEW #23:  2 stars  (1294 chars)
Not really my most favorite Starbucks location. I have had waaaay better customer service at the one at Rainbow and Warm Springs. ...  ... The times I have gone there, it was via drive-thru. It was my dad and I ordering our drinks and for some reason, the barista just could not hear us! There were no cars behind or in front of us at one time and our radio was on the lowest level (we always turn down the volume whenever we go through a drive-thru). I had to tell the barista my order five times (caramel frappuccino with vanilla bean powder that she kept mistaking for a vanilla bean frap or just a plain caramel frap). She was confused with my order and she just wasn't listening! Either they need to get a new system or listen more carefully. ...  ... Another time I have gone, I didn't want to go through the mess of a drive-thru so I went inside. The vibe is nice and the baristas looked happy to be working and were chatting amongst themselves before I ordered. HOWEVER, when I ordered, the mood suddenly changed and the lady that took my order gave off this feeling that she didn't want to be bothered with my order. What's worse is that when I got my drink, it was all watered down but because I didn't want to be there any longer, I went about my business and left. NEVER GOING BACK.

REVIEW #24:  2 stars  (211 chars)
Rolled by Starbucks at 8:30am for breakfast, which was a tall steamed non-fat milk and an apple bran muffin.  I guess it was decent enough to rate a 3, but I have to subtract 1 star for the lack of organic milk.

REVIEW #25:  2 stars  (122 chars)
Slowest Starbucks ever! Was in the drive thru for over 20 mins... They can't hear you on the speaker so you have to scream

REVIEW #26:  2 stars  (175 chars)
The barista charged my coffee on the credit card AND the Starbucks card when I gave him the credit card to transfer some funds onto my Starbucks card. Big no no my friend ....

REVIEW #27:  2 stars  (380 chars)
The place doesn't give off the Starbucks feel... It's like they don't know how to provide great service.  I read one of the reviews stating that they consistently get his order mixed and I agree, I think the problem is that they do not listen.  I had to repeat my order 4 times to make sure that they don't mess it up.  Never again, I'll head out to the other Starbucks locations.

One of the best Starbucks in the valley.  Every time I go to this location I always get perfect service and drink.  The staff is very friendly and they always make my drink exactly how I want it.  When I walk in now they already know my order and begin making it before I get to the counter.  Never a disappointment and I wish all Starbucks were like this one.

REVIEW #2:  5 stars  (673 chars)
Out of all the Starbucks in the Henderson area, this one is my favorite.  I have no problem with the parking but people in this city have terrible driving habits so I can understand how difficult and challenging it must be for them.  Bummer for those who don't like it that there is no drive through... evidently they haven't been inside a store that has one...those are absolutely filthy inside...don't believe me?  Go inside sometime and check it out!  The servers are friendly and courteous and accommodating... They go out of their way to fulfill any request.  I guess you could say they are old school.  Maybe I'm partial being a regular and all but that's my 2 cents.

REVIEW #3:  5 stars  (191 chars)

REVIEW #4:  4 stars  (513 chars)
Being the closest Starbuck's to my apartment, I have been patronizing it the last four years.Up to this day, I never had a bad Starbuck's experience here. ...   At the crossroads of Green Valley Parkway and Warm Springs Road, and in the heart of Green Valley, it gets busy. There have been visits where I have had to wait on a line then wait on a table. ...         Despite the fact that the tables fill up, there is plenty of indoor and outdoor seating.  ...     A recent drawback is that they now close earlier.

REVIEW #5:  4 stars  (395 chars)
I know I am addicted.. I love the Starbucks.. They are pretty much everywhere now, and it is hard to write a review for just one store. Parking is tricky, watch yourself no need to run over a slow person (they need coffee) and don't think you will get out of there quickly. They are pretty good with my order just have to remind them ICE FIRST, says so in the manual.. I have google too people..

REVIEW #6:  4 stars  (489 chars)
This is like any other Starbucks, so nothing major to report; but the fact that it's an out of town location. ...  ... I checked in on Four Square and noticed that the tip read that the people who worked here were horrible and snobby or something like that.  I saw two girls working there and I can kind of see how one of them could be seen that way, but she was nice to me.  Ordered our drinks and out the door we were. ...  ... Went there twice in a weekend and both times were pleasant.

REVIEW #9:  2 stars  (317 chars)
Color me unimpressed. I wanted Starbucks before work and decided to stop at a location I had never been to. No drive-thru, so I had to go inside to place my order.  ...  ... The workers weren't the chipper, friendly, polite baristas I come to expect when I am paying $5 for a cup of coffee.  ...  ... I won't be back.

REVIEW #10:  2 stars  (535 chars)
Starbucks is a Starbucks is a Starbucks . . . except, this is one of the most consistently slow Starbucks I've ever visited.   ...  ... Whether there are 3 people in line or 10, it always takes a long time to get a drink.  To be fair to the staff, most of the time I've been here, the customers are ordering multiple drinks.  And I've never seen the place empty.  So the staff seems to be doing the best they can.  But they never seem to catch up.   ...  ... So if you're looking to drop in and grab a quick coffee drink, go elsewhere.

REVIEW #11:  1 stars  (2881 chars)
This is the worst location in the history of Starbucks.  ...  ... 1- It has the most awkward parking. The lot is always an accident waiting to happen. Nobody seems to pay attention when pulling out of their tiny spots. ...  ... 2- HORRIBLE baristas. I give the benefit of the doubt here and there, but they're always rude and if you order anything other than pike they make you feel like your order is bothering them. ...  ... The last visit I had sealed the 1 star review for me. I was third in line of probably 9 people total . I was in line for about 8 minutes, not because they were busy but because the barista was having the longest conversation with her friend/customer. I felt rude doing it, but I HAD to ask then to speed it up because I wanted to go home so I could get ready for work.  ...  ... I obviously annoyed this bitter woman because she had THEEE worst attitude when I gave her my order. She didn't ask if I wanted a receipt and she nearly snapped my gold card in the machine. UGH! ...  ... At this point I could have just went home and brewed my own pot of coffee.... ...  ... After another few minutes of waiting for my drink, I couldn't believe it, but the barista was chatting it up again! I appreciate friendly people and a nice "Hello, how are you? etc." is more than welcome, but there's a time and place for extended "catching up". I was listening as the barista chatted with her friend, and to my surprise she wasn't JUST talking... she was making fun of the customer that was in front of me in line! SERIOUSLY STARBUCKS?... I felt soooo bad listening to this rotten woman making fun of the appearance and order of a customer that just paid $6.00 for your damn coffee! I was SO irritated. I HAD to say something again. I said "Excuse me but I've been here for well over 10 minutes now, you're not busy, you're not doing your job, all you've been doing is making fun of your customers!!!".. she sucked her teeth, muttered under her breath and .... ...  ... ...Needless to say my coffee was ready. She plopped it on the counter and said "here".  ...  ... Wow. thanks.  ...  ... I left (it was a 15 minute ordeal) with COLD coffee, the complete wrong order, and it was drowning in syrup.  ...  ...  ... I need good coffee to start my day. Since this subhuman decided it was OK to be mean to other customers, I figured I could give them a dose right back. I went to my favorite location (1 mile up the road, where I should have just went to begin with) and I told them what happened with my coffee in hand. They apoligized for the actions of the barista and gave me the email of their area supervisor, along with a replacement cup of perfect coffee. --A happy ending to a miserable start of the day.  ...  ... DO NOT BOTHER WITH THIS PLACE! Instead, go right up the road to the pebble marketplace (Smith's/Brooklyn Bagel and Pizzza hut are in the same mall)

Got to say, busy Starbucks!  ...  ... I tend to stop in here when I head to Costco.  Every time I come, always a long line.  Service is friendly and pleasing.  I noticed only a few tables available, but usually occupied by patrons.  Space is very tight; hardly any room to walk.  My drinks come out very well and I hardly feel like there was any errors. ...  ... I noticed the drive-thru outside.  Looks packed as well.  So if you are in a crunch, best to find another Starbucks.

I don't know how my work mornings would look like without this Starbucks establishment. Probably like waking up after a hard night of partying and removing the beer goggles and rolling over and seeing a stranger watching you sleep. I would imagine. ...  ... Always pleasant, always cheery. They've gotten my order wrong only a handful of times, but their pleasantness always makes it a good start to my morning.

It's got a drive-thru, which is a great plus. Not as many tables as a lot of other Starbucks, but I really enjoyed getting some work done a few days ago here. Service was friendly and my drink was perfect with no mistakes. I also like that it's kind of tucked away from the rest of the Sunset commercial area!

REVIEW #10:  4 stars  (630 chars)
Not to be confused with the Galleria location, this is a Starbucks w/ drive-thru that's located in a strip mall near-ish to Best Buy. They've provided fairly consistent service when I've been here during the past several months, except today when the cashier handling the inside register during frappuccino happy hour had issues filling orders. Seems like the guy ahead of me had two orders but she had to ask for his name and a form of payment twice instead of just once. For mine, she grabbed the 30+ oz. cup instead of my venti and wrote my name on it, but the manager caught it and didn't give me a larger drink free. Dang it!

REVIEW #17:  2 stars  (563 chars)
I used to go to this location all the time, most of the baristas knew my order by heart.  However it seems that the entire staff changed to a not so friendly atmosphere. I also have noticed that it is always dirty, even when there are 5 employees there. No body can wipe down the bar or add-ins bar??? Not to mention that the barista who slid my drink did it with such force it fell off and splattered all over me! Sorry to say this location has gone way downhill. I'd rather drive a little extra to get the great service I know the company would want me to have.

REVIEW #18:  2 stars  (306 chars)
I'm giving them 2 stars, only because this is the closest Starbucks to my house. The service is slow, and many times I have seen baristas walking around while the line was out the door. Unfortunately many of the baristas seem more intent on having inappropriate conversations than taking care of customers.

REVIEW #19:  2 stars  (464 chars)
I've given this place 3 chances now. And everytime it's the same crap. They are slow and make messes everywhere. I will not come here anymore. It takes 20 minutes MINIMUM to make one drink. This time the girl screwed up my order. I'm so done with this place. It's slow and messy. That's all I have to say. Even the drive thru gets backed up beyond belief. If you go at a slow time, then of course they are fast. I've gone different times of the day and still crap.

REVIEW #20:  2 stars  (256 chars)
To the barista that made my drink I saw you drop my cup and didn't give me a new one. Luckily I don't drink off of my rim that I wont complain and mess up your long line of drinks. Which btw wouldn't be so long if all your partners were actually working!!!

REVIEW #21:  1 stars  (753 chars)
First time here and the last time. Was greeted and promptly having our ordered started. In the middle of our order being taken someone else took over while the manager began to scold the employee that was first helping us right in front of us.  ... They ask for the name to call when order was ready. We went and sat down and I noticed people leaving with there orders that came in after us. My husband went up and our drinks were just sitting on the counter!!! ... I got the Strawberry & Crme frap and it had no Strawberry taste just a Crme taste.  ... It was dirty in there and HOT!! ... Will never go again. It was uncomfortable and rude to us to see an employee get scolded when the manager should have taken them to the back and talked with them!!!

I drink Starbucks every morning and 9/ 10 times I go to this Starbucks. Usually I have nothing to complain about bc usually I go through the drive-thru and they do great! But today the line was ridiculous so I decided it might be quicker to go inside... ... Everything was going fine until the girl started making my drink (Venti, iced, quad, non fat caramel macchiato) first she filled the cup almost to the rim with milk and ice, so much that when it came time to put in the espresso (which she had in a little paper cup- weird) she couldn't fit it all in so she dumped the rest of my espresso out and then spooned out some more that was at the top of the cup in order to fit the top on.... are you kidding me! When I pay $6.22 for my coffee I expect all my espresso to be in there... I don't pay for milk and ice! I just thought this was absolutely crazy... I will not go to this Starbucks anymore now that I know that they are not giving me my moneys worth! -I take my coffee very seriously in the morning- ;)

They took my order wrong. I had ordered and iced caramel latte, and i got an iced mocha with caramel drizzle... My bfs drink was so jam packed with java chips he could barely drink it. He spent most of his time chewing. And two people got their orders before I had received mine. Lastly the place was a mess! Like disgusting. The counters looked like a dish pit. Water ice and coffee every where. Not to mention workers were also a hot mess. Geez watching them work was like watching a train wreck. No sense of efficiency either.

This location is located just inside of Target.   It was later in the evening that I was in need of my caffeine.   The girls working here were great!  They were quick to take my order and quick to make my drink.  I had noticed that their dessert case was a little more than half empty.  I wasn't in need of one but just in case someone wanted something, there was little to choose from. ...  ... In a previous review it was said they didn't accept their gift cards but I asked anyway.  There wasn't any issue taking it which made me happy.   I'm assuming they had updated their systems.   ...  ... Since I'm usually shopping at Target, it makes it really convenient for me for a quick stop on my way out.   Win Win!

REVIEW #2:  3 stars  (2039 chars)
No reviews for a busy Starbucks inside the Green Valley at Horizon Ridge Parkways Target? There is one now. ...  ...   Actually this review is overdue. I am such a Starbuck"s and coffee shop fan that the "S" in my profile name could stand for Starbucks.  This is one of a handful of Starbuck's that I regularly visit. It is in a relatively new and clean Target, and shares a shopping center with New York Chinese Restaurant and Petco which I patronize. Not to mention it is near my house.  ...  ...   In name this location is a Starbuck's. But in reality it is a glorified Target department. The Starbucks card is not accepted here. There are less pastries than the corporate owned stores. And I don't even think that the employees here are called baristas. I noticed that the dude who served my coffee later served my fountain soda at the snack bar. But whether it is Target or Starbuck's owned, they serve the same premium coffee based beverages at similar prices. ...  ...   The issue with this location is that it will get busy and one poor associate has to perform miracles to serve a long line of people. If it wasn't pumpkin spice season, I probably would have thrown in the towel and walked across the parking lot for a cup of coffee in Layer's Bakery. Anyway, I want to give a shout out to Maria for handling a long line of customers by herself and joking around with them. ...  ...  The advantage of this Starbuck's is the sundry of tables. What I appreciate is that some of the tables are large and there is sufficient lighting. Not once have I had to delay time for an available table. This makes me relaxed, and when I am in that state I might buy more things at Target. ...  ...   I so don't see myself buying a coffee machine soon. And forget about instant coffee. But I clearly see myself continuing to visit Starbuck's to perk up with caffeinated beverages in a relaxing environment. With that said,  my check-ins will continue in the Green Valley at Horizon Ridge Parkways Target Starbuck's and a grande number of others.

REVIEW #3:  2 stars  (1319 chars)
Probably in the top 3 worst Starbucks I've ever came across. I live across the street from Target and I love to get me some Starbucks when I go for a small shop, however every time I have ever came here my drink was made completely wrong. But that's honestly not the even the worst issue I've seen here. Their customer service skills are THEE worst I have ever seen. The girls who work there are so depressing to even approach. I don't know if they're not getting paid enough or what, but sheesh would it hurt to smile a little? Not a single employee has ever said "thank you" or "have a nice day". They don't personalize with you, along with never asking your name for your drink(s). There is one lady there who does have good personalizing skills, she's an older lady, with dark hair, she's a kind person. But she talks TOO long to the customers she's most familiar with. She ends up creating a long line due to her personalizing skills. But hey at least she smiles, unlike the other employee's (it's only because of her I rate them 2 stars). I've given this Starbucks multiple chances at redeeming themselves and I've simply had enough of me wasting money on drinks they can't even make correctly. I will no longer order from this pathetic excuse of a Starbucks unless they are retrained on how to make a cappuccino.

An iced Cafe Mocha with an extra shot is the same in Topeka as it is here. This location gets 4 stars based on service. It's service that's fast and without attitude.

REVIEW #4:  4 stars  (255 chars)
Staff is kind. For a bunch of teenagers, I'm impressed. ... They made my drink efficiently, even though I'm sure I heard some gossip  about "being thrown under the bus" and "quitting or getting fired"..... But, not bad. I'll be visiting when I am in Vons.

REVIEW #5:  4 stars  (265 chars)
Starbucks is starbucks. I have always had great, quick, and friendly service at this location which inside the Vons on Horizon Ridge. It is located right by the door so I can quickly stop in and get a coffee even if I am not going in to shop. Keep up the good work!

REVIEW #6:  4 stars  (206 chars)
This is a Starbuck's located inside Von's. It is owned and managed by Von's. ...   Plenty of help and seats. ...   Very convenient for a caffeine boost  when I patronize this Von's or I am headed southeast.

REVIEW #7:  2 stars  (364 chars)
My girl friend and I are pretty much regulars at this Starbucks because it's convenient. Now that they have hired a new staff they continue to mess up on every coffee we get. Either it's too sweet to melted or tast like they pored a whole bag of chocolate powder in it. Absolutely disgusting. It's a waist of money and I would not suggest this Starbucks to anyone!

I asked a lot if questions, all were answered with a smile. ...  Clean, pretty, lots of sunlight. ...  Our order was perfect, and the Pumpkin Scones are to die for. ...  They have soy milk, for us nondairy folk. I think they have almond milk too, but not clear on that. ...  I really like the decor here. I will visit again! Haven't been here in years since a friend was in town and we got coffee and drive through RedRock.

I have never thought to review a starbucks, since they are on every corner and I go so often. This Place deserves it. Whoever is hiring is right on.

The best Starbucks from LA to NYC. I have been to quite a few Starbucks. This location has the best staff, by far. It is a very busy location, yet you still get in and out in a reasonable amount of time. The staff is very friendly.

REVIEW #6:  5 stars  (771 chars)
This is always my go to Starbucks that I go to. I usually use the drive thru, but if the line is way too long, you can go inside yourself and usually get faster service since everyone is outside  ...  ... The staff here is usually always friendly and bubbly. I don't think there was ever a time I had bad service here.  ...  ... My favorites here is either the Seasonal Pumpkin Spice Frappucino, the Green Tea Frapp with strawberries or the Vanilla Bean frapp with caramel drizzle.  ...  ... This is the only store that makes my Green tea frappucino that makes it right. Its probably because I usually only order it here, but Other stores never blend my drinks all the way, so I get chunks of ice that block my straw.  ...  ... All in all, great service and great drinks.

REVIEW #7:  4 stars  (265 chars)
A pretty good Starbucks in it's own right. I go there when I need a pick me up or just to chill. Very clean and the staff is above average in helpfulness. The only drawback is that it's in a very busy part of summerlin so sometimes lines can get astronomically long

REVIEW #9:  4 stars  (2218 chars)
OK, since I'm the Duchess of this place (41 check-ins and counting...) I should probably write a review. ...  ... Yes, I have an addiction.  It's brutal.  However, I'm not looking to kick-it anytime soon, as my GOLD STARBUCKS CARD just arrived in the mail.  Yes, that is how addicted I am!  (yikes!) ...  ... You don't know about the GOLD card?  If you have a gift card, you can reload it.  When you use it, you gain "points" and then you get extras. ... Once you reach the Gold level you get the following: ... - A free beverage on your birthday ... - Free beverage customization ... - Free brewed coffee or tea refills with each visit ... - Free tall beverage with whole bean purchase ... - Free trial offers ... - Free drink every 15 stars ... - Personalized Offers and coupons ...  ... p.s. It's free to sign-up.  ...  ... Back on this location: ...  ... This drive-thru is INSANE in the mornings (7:30am-9:00am) and insane, I mean about a 15 minute wait. Although, you will get the random day that you can zip right through.  I blame the delays on people ordering the breakfast sandwiches. They are delicious; however, that is what makes it a 10-car backup (to McDonalds)! ...  ... But, I must admit I have NEVER been inside of this one!  I have always done the drive-thru and the time limit doesn't ALWAYS bother me, because I can check emails, etc. while waiting.  (haha!) ...  ... The Barista's are really nice and ALWAYS get my drink orders right.  Never had an issue with that and they have great recommendations on drinks. ...  ... Some of my favs: ... - Grande, Non-Fat, No Whip, White Chocolate Mocha, or make it a Venti with an extra shot of Espresso. ... - Venti, Iced, Non-Fat, No Whip, Unsweetened, Green Tea Latte (if its sweetened- its like crack!) ... - Grande, Non-Fat, No Whip, Green Tea Frappuccino, add Protein Powder ... - Venti Caramel Fraccuccino, No Whip ... - Cocoa Cappuccino: I like this, except its not strong enough for me. ...  ... The Matcha Green Tea (which is used in the Latte and Frappuccino) is what really got me hooked.  You either love it or hate it and I became OBSESSED! ...  ... I have been known to go to Starbucks twice in one day.  Don't hate the player- hate the game!

REVIEW #10:  4 stars  (416 chars)
Starbucks.  What can I say.   This one is pretty quick with the drive-thru service, although in general Starbucks drive-thrus are pretty darn slow no matter what time it is. ...  ... And on a hawt day, you just can't lay off those coffee frappacinos, ya know?   Just nom nom, frappe, nom nom. ...  ... That, and a cinammon swirl coffee cake, completes the taste bud madness.  Truly one of your coffee nom nom places.

REVIEW #11:  4 stars  (464 chars)
This is a bit larger than the common Starbuck's store.  They always have plenty of pastries, a large number of tables indoors, and there's a patio outside that they share with the Tropical Smoothies store. ...  ... I have only been on the patio once.  There are enough pigeons to make any visit a painful stop unless you're into chasing them and trying to kick them in the ass.  But that fun grows tiresome quickly, so I just stay inside or take my coffee with me.

REVIEW #12:  4 stars  (750 chars)
This location is so busy and the staff is great. I was a little disappointed this morning when I went to go sit outside. They usually have plenty of outdoor seating, but I think someone went and stole all of the chairs last night. There were like 20 tables and 2 chairs. What the heck? This is not a joke. ...  ... I love that this drive thru is always packed. I love to pay for the car behind me. It always makes the cashiers smile and I know that the person behind me will smile. It happened to me once here and I thought it was such a cool thing to do. So now I try to do it as much as I can.  ...  ... You never know, maybe it will keep going like a chain and make people have a great day. Oh and the coffee is pretty good. I love my Chai Lattes.

REVIEW #13:  4 stars  (200 chars)
This store is always busy. They generally have the best employees in the morning hours, and lack good help in the evenings. So visit early and ask for Monica, Bree, Lauren for the friendliest service.

REVIEW #14:  4 stars  (534 chars)
We were in the drive -thru for quite a while, but it was worth the service we received. During the duration of our order, two workers rotated because of the volume of the order. Everything was recorded exactly. By the time we rolled up to the window, this is where the fun begins. We had 3 separate transactions take place with the payment and they were very patient. The order execution was slacking slightly, but again it was made up with the service.  ...  ... Kudos goes out to Taylor for being patient and awesome through it all.

REVIEW #15:  3 stars  (199 chars)
Not too many tables, coffee is good of course.  Baristas know what they are doing and how to make a special request.  Very busy place because of the location.  Seating outside.  Drive-thur available.

The location is nice but the staff can be annoying. There is a guy that works the nights that is very loud and annoying. One time I forgot my headphones and had to leave because he wouldn't stop singing and being loud.

REVIEW #17:  2 stars  (555 chars)
This location is not my favorite.  Coffee is good, seating on the covered outdoor patio is good, but always smokers...but 2 issues are caused by the drive-thru: parking and/or driving in/out is a death-trap (everyone is always and somehow confused by the setup), and if you are ordering inside...at least 8 people working behind the counter but minutes can go by before they acknowledge someone in line.  It's slow service for walk-ins. ...  ... This was my local store when I lived in Vegas, so I went here about 6 times before I decided to go elsewhere.

REVIEW #18:  1 stars  (359 chars)
Came in on a Friday night eager to try the new app for the giftcard. Ordered 2 drinks, handed her my iPhone to scan the giftcard and I was told, "I can't take that!" with some blond attitude. Um... Didn't Starbucks launch that program? If she had been nice about it, I'd have no issue but she wants to give me attitude for what Starbucks had been advertising.

REVIEW #19:  1 stars  (204 chars)
Terrible service was ignored then panini wasn't even put in to heat until I asked about it then they sat it on the counter and didn't even call it out, rude staff!! And they weren't even busy at the time!

REVIEW #20:  1 stars  (572 chars)
Worst service ever, I was in line while someone was getting an order and the guy who was at the cashier was giving a lot of attitude towards the customer. Especially since he was paying and taking out coins from his pocket. He practically threw the guy his straw after he picked up his drink. After drinking my drink and on my laptop that is connected to the plug and the cord was on the floor. One of their coworkers was mopping the floor and practically wiped my whole cord with his mop. Who knows where they've wiped their mop?! Isn't that disgusting and health hazard?

REVIEW #7:  4 stars  (748 chars)
Close to the Church I go to, this spot is nice with a huge lobby. Interior design is very similar to any other Starbucks, but with more lounge chairs and a huge comfortable couch.  The staff is aight except the one that always seems higggggggh, guy is super cool.  He likes to converse with me as if he knows me.  Next time i'll bring him a bag of chips and if he accepts, i'll conclude that he is high. ...  ... It's very quiet and rarely gets crowded.  I like chillin here to kill time or get some work done on my laptop.  It's located in a plaza surrounded by nice neighborhoods and the crowd are older than the norm of what we usually see chillin in coffee shops, your middle age class working citizens rather than your average college student.

Conveniently located on the way to my Son's school, I stop by here on occasion in the morning to grab a cup of Joe.  I am simple and enjoy a half-caf Americano Grande.  I normally use the drive-thru here, but will go inside if the line is too long. ...  ... The staff here is friendly and always get my order right.  That's all I ask for at this Starbucks location. ...  ... Will I return?  Yeppers.

REVIEW #9:  4 stars  (726 chars)
I come to this Starbucks usually when I'm on my way to Church or coming from Church.  This particular Starbucks is a little bit bigger than the other ones I've been to in the area.  The seating area is a little bigger and it has a big comfortable couch near the barista so as soon as you place your order, grab the couch! You'll fall asleep on it-- like Paul from the Diamond Center, I guarantee it! (I miss the 90s!) ...  ... We've held meetings here before and they never had a problem with it.  There's a little secluded area to the right of the entrance when you walk in so it gives some privacy if you do have a private meeting here.  The staff is pretty quick with your drinks and is almost never too busy. Check em out!

REVIEW #10:  4 stars  (440 chars)
It's a Starbucks and it has a drive-through and the baristas are friendly and perky (caffeine overload?).  I am a recent coffee convert, thanks to hubby, and really craved a coffee yesterday morning.  Since we just ran out of coffee beans the previous day, and since we were running late to church, we decided to grab some *bux to go....one sip, and I felt myself becoming more alert. ...  ... How sad that my mornings have come to this....

My profile headline reads: "Yelp is my diary, and my reviews are the written pages of my life." This past Saturday, the Cheyenne Avenue at 215 Starbuck's was a part of my life for a good hour. ...  ...    After a workout hiking up Lone Mountain, I was up to relaxing and keeping awake with a grande Starbuck's drip with pumpkin spice syrup. This Starbuck's was a good choice.  ...  ...    This Starbuck's stands off the north side of Cheyenne Avenue immediately east of the 215. It is a pad in the Walmart Neighborhood Market Shopping Center. Parking is plentiful for Starbuck's customers that drink their beverage in the lobby. The drive thru is a convenience for the Starbuck's customers on the go. ...  ...   Inside is a plush Starbuck's that  makes for a fitting place to relax with a hot beverage. The layout is elongated, which creates a few relaxing  zones. On the east section of the lobby there are plush chairs and on the west section there is a separate room with a few seats. Throughout the lobby there is the standard seating arrangement with chairs and tables. With the counter in the middle, the sections at both ends of the lobby have a lower noise level. Reading the newspapers on my smart phone compliments of complimentary WiFi, I felt like I was in a lounge drinking coffee. ...  ...    The baristas that represent this Starbuck's are friendly. They took time out from what they were doing to talk to me. They gave me a tip that is worth passing on: "If you purchase a Starbuck's card, and have at least $5 on it, refills are free." When they were not helping customers, they were cleaning. This is a plush Starbuck's that was very clean on my visit. ...  ...   Because Yelp is my diary, and my reviews are the written pages of my life, I will write about the places that I visit. And it is guaranteed that I will write about more Starbuck's.

Standard Starbucks with a drive-thru, friendly staff. Only ever had my order wrong once and I didn't throw it back in their face as other Starbucks patrons have been known to do. ...  ... Venti iced green tea with three pumps of classic. Best way to stay hydrated in this 105 degree weather! ^.^

REVIEW #15:  4 stars  (506 chars)
This is a great location and they always make my sweetened passion tea lemonade perfect! I've never gone inside, I'm a drive-thru-er and most if the time I have great service is fantastic, always chatting with me while I wait for my drink. Unless the guy with the long ponytail is working, he has this "I hate my job" mood it feels like and you get the vibe he doesn't want to be there. I try to be as cheery as possible with him, make him hate it less I guess. Ha. Overall I do enjoy this location though.

REVIEW #16:  3 stars  (235 chars)
I'm actually not a particularly big fan of Starbucks for their coffee. I find it kind of acidic and a bit strong for my liking. I am a fan of their frapachinos and pastries, but alas, far too many Calories for me to visit consistantly.

REVIEW #17:  3 stars  (890 chars)
It is a starbucks so the results are limited here. I despise the concept of starbucks as it is clearly designed for people to get their drinks to go. I prefer the more traditional coffee houses with couches, games and music.  The limited seating at Starbucks is uncomfortable, there are not many outlets available for wifi and there is no warmth to the place.  I also don't drink cofee and the alternate selections are also limited. ...  ... That said, my favorite breakfast sandwich is the egg and gouda sandwich.  They always have madelaines for my daughter and although their boxed meals are a little on the pricey side of things, they have creative combinations including a cheese tray, turkey and hummus, etc...  The staff here is very friendly and I do like the smoothies. ...  ... Overall, this place gives an extra oomph to the product that everyone else in the world seems to love.

REVIEW #18:  3 stars  (418 chars)
This Starbucks has a huge lobby and extended lobby on the side. The area rug and couches bring warmth to the place. But the customer service is hit or miss. I come here a lot, and there are days when the staff look like zombies- maybe they need the coffee more than I do. And then they have their perky days.  Overall, it's a nice place to hang out and have some coffee but it's tragic that this location closes early.

REVIEW #19:  2 stars  (172 chars)
I order the same drink every time and each time it's made differently. I never have trouble with my drink at most locations. They just don't listen to what you're ordering.

REVIEW #20:  2 stars  (336 chars)
Normally I'd give this location a 5 star rating. However, based upon my last 2 trips I'm giving them 2. I have ordered my drinks both times with no whip creme and both times they put it in anyways. The order on the cup even says, "no whip creme."  They just need to start paying attention again and checking their orders. Very annoying.

REVIEW #21:  1 stars  (203 chars)

One of the worst Starbucks I've ever been to! First couple times I went, a black/white mixed girl rang me up. She's rude, never smiles, never says hi, never says thank you. I don't know how she can work in customer service. ... Went again this morning and ordered a pumpkin spice latte. When I was walking out to my car, I realized it was double cupped, which is unusual. Normally the only drinks that are double cupped are hot teas or coffee, as they are hotter than regular steamed milk drinks. I know because I worked at Starbucks for a few years. Anyway, I ignored it. When I got to my office, I checked to see why...here's why: ...  ... The cup the drink was in was a MESS! Pumpkin syrup EVERYwhere. Half the cup on the outside was covered in it making the whole thing a sticky mess. I was so shocked that they were too lazy to change the cup and decide to cover it up by putting it in another cup. I mean, who does this?! I know spills happen but clean up after yourselves and especially don't hand a customer a cup that's covered in syrup on the outside. What a bunch of idiots! ...  ... Disgusting service, disgusting preparation of drinks. Had my old district manager seen me or one of my coworkers do this back in the day, it's a write-up for sure. ...  ... This Starbucks is an embarrassment.

REVIEW #23:  1 stars  (305 chars)
We went to the drive-thru. We ordered 4 drinks. It took them 10 mins. for the drinks. They got 3 wrong and forgot about the other one. As we were waiting we saw the whip cream thing HANGING OFF THE TRASH CAN!!! After 20 mins they finally got our order right. After all of this they did not even say sorry.

I enjoy coming to this Starbucks and never have had a real bad experience. I look forward to the greets & small talk of a retired group of biker men, who hang out every day for their morning cup of Joe. The staff is friendly, they pretty know my usual drinks of choice, and most of them know my name. My only main complaint is why bother having 2 cash registers if your only going to use one!!!! Even when the line is long...there is only one cashier taking and ringing up orders!!! Please have a 2nd cashier!!!It would make the line go so much faster!!! This is why I only gave 4 stars instead of 5 stars!!!

I like the new decor and set up, except it will get too crowded with their center display by the register. ...  ... I purchased my typical hot caramel macchiatto with non fat milk.   ...  ... They did add more tables but removed the comfy chairs.

REVIEW #9:  4 stars  (185 chars)
I'm able to get a venti iced coffee with milk or green tea (unsweetened) for under $3 in this hot ass day. Free iced water too. Minus one star for long lines in the drive-thru. #winning

one of the good Starbucks in this area, good service, quick, if you don't feel like going inside, there's always the drive thru

REVIEW #12:  3 stars  (351 chars)
I usually come here every morning on my way to work. The staff is friendly and when I go into the store it's always clean. The drive thru is 80% of the time very slow. I've waited 15 minutes for coffee stuck in the drive thru with a moderate/shorter line. I don't know what they do behind the scenes after you order, but they need to pick up the pace.

REVIEW #13:  3 stars  (159 chars)
Typical Starbucks, even without a line it took a long time to get your coffee but then again I think there was a line around the building in the drive through.

REVIEW #14:  3 stars  (1272 chars)
When I first saw a drive-through Starbucks...I was ecstatic.  I think there is only one drive-through in Cali which I heard was in Livermore (which was very far from where I used to live so I never even knew) ... It sure made it very convenient esp for those with kids or if it's too hot to get out or if the weather is sucky...drive-through is the way to go.  ... But I have been very disappointed lately with the service at Starbucks. ... Maybe because there are new people there or they are just too wired to actually pay attention to my order to get it right. ... I will go to Starbucks in the am and order the same thing.  50% of the time they will get it right.  ... How hard is it to make a VENTI ICED AMERICANO WITH AN ADD SHOT, TOFFEE NUT SYRUP AND CREAM.   ... One time they used hazelnut...i know my syrups!!!.. ... One time it was too sweet ... One time they gave me someone else's drink ... One time it was almost like a latte - all milk ... One time I actually had to go back and got the right one.  ...  ... I love Starbucks...but come on now....aren't all the drinks supposed to be uniform according to how it is ordered???? ...  ... My drink is simple....I don't want to have to accuse of someone slippin some kahlua in the baristas drinks before shift!!!

REVIEW #15:  2 stars  (579 chars)
I come to this Starbucks every day, thru the drive thru. And everyday they can never hear me, so I'm always repeating at least twice. I order the same drink every day, 8 times out 10, it tastes different. Same drink just something is always off day after day. So frustrating. The other HUGE deal, the drive thru is a ridiculous wait! Whether it be 3 cars or 10, give yourself at least 10 min to get thru the line, at least!  ... Up here in southern Highlands there isn't a lot to choose from, with anything but I can guarantee if there was a coffee bean next store, I'd be there!

REVIEW #16:  2 stars  (449 chars)
OVERPRICED!!! What a rip off! ...  ... Regular coffee in a very well marketed logo cup. That is what Starbucks coffee is all about. Take a way the brand name and you might as well drink Sanka. What the hell is the deal with the tip cube???? You want your employees to make more money. Then raise your prices because I am not tipping someone just for selling me coffee. Make your own cup of coffee at home or go to a gas station. Not worth the $$$$$$

This frappuccino happy hour thing is lame. Get fat, and develop diabetes, between 3-5pm for half price!!!

REVIEW #18:  2 stars  (517 chars)
This is the closest location to my place so I go here often. Staff's normally pleasant. I've only gone inside once and they were pretty rude, so it's the drive thru for me now. Not much of a long wait. I'm weird so even during the summer I drink hot coffee. Never a problem there. I tried the treat receipt or whatever it is called and ordered a cold beverage (passion something?)  it was really watered down. Not refreshing at all. I'll stick with my white chocolate mocha, at least they know how to make that right.

REVIEW #19:  2 stars  (133 chars)
This is the only Starbucks in my neighborhood so I go here by default. Friendly enough staff but they are consistently sooooo slow :(

REVIEW #20:  1 stars  (258 chars)
Apparently you cannot order the traveler through the drive-through even though it does not state that anywhere on the menu and if you go inside to order the traveler the clerks get upset and sigh as though your an inconvenience to them.  No customer service.

REVIEW #21:  1 stars  (1008 chars)
As a former Sbux barista, I know the job can be taxing especially when it's busy so I usually cut baristas some slack. That being said, this is the WORST sbux location I have EVER been too. Painfully slow, not friendly, lack of menu knowledge, forgetful...I could literally go on and on. You can tell the employees are not happy especially since this location has one of the highest turnover rates in the city! There is someone new there almost every week and there are always grossly undertrained. I know it's great to treat your regulars like family but if you are not one of the four men that go there every single day and sit there for hours, these baristas do not car about you. This location is walking distance from my home so I go there out of convenience (and fairly often I hate to admit) I order regular coffee and not one of them remembers my name or my drink. Just a bad experience overall every time I go there. I'm going to start driving the 10/15 minutes out my way just to go somewhere else.

REVIEW #22:  1 stars  (140 chars)
I go to Starbucks all over and this one is super slow and super rude. This is def the worst starbucks in town!!! Avoid it like the plague!!!

REVIEW #23:  1 stars  (365 chars)
I was there twice in the last three days. Encountered I think their manager who was frantically running around the place. I waited over 10 minutes for a simple ice tea. When I questioned that my drink was late and might have been forgotten she said, we're busy. Welcome to Starbucks! In an exasperated tone I would not drive out of my way for that experience again.

REVIEW #24:  1 stars  (1431 chars)
If I could give NEGATIVE stars I would. I moved to this area over 5 years ago and this Starbucks has gone from awesome to dismal!  ...  ... Five years ago, their drive through was on point. The wait was no longer than five minutes - now the wait is upwards of fifteen to twenty minutes!  Really?!?!  Most people have places to go and if they want their coffee treat, they, like me, leave ten to fifteen minutes earlier so they can get their treat. This Starbucks will make you late EVERY SINGLE TIME! ...  ... Then you add the people. Five years ago, the staff was awesome!  They knew who I was, knew what I wanted and was very friendly. This new staff leaves a lot to be desired. They are rude and borderline mean. They screw up my order every time. Just last night I ordered a TRENTA iced tea and the barista said I ordered a VENTI. I think I know what I ordered as this is the SAME drink I order EVERY SINGLE DAY!!!!  Fix your damn ordering system or have the baristas clean their ears!! ...  ... And lastly, don't bother going there if they are near closing. They are so rude during that time that they will not cater to their customers. Tried to order a pastry and got told "we've already dumped our pastries for the night" - really?!?! I thought you cleaned up AFTER you closed the store??  Ridiculous! ...  ... Basically if you can, go to another Starbucks and don't bother with this place until they get their act together!

REVIEW #25:  1 stars  (116 chars)
If you have to be somewhere this is one of the slowest drive thru lines ever , even the wait inside is pretty long .

REVIEW #26:  1 stars  (442 chars)
The most convenient Starbucks, but unfortunately, management needs to spend more time with their employees. Got my name name wrong after spelling out (MARTIN is not a difficult name to spell), asked for several pastries and got served one, and apparently a caramel macchiato doesn't have caramel at this location. On a positive note, I got a beautiful smile from one of the beautiful girls working there, which is the reason for the one star.

Went to this Starbucks this morning (3/1/12) and frankly, it's subpar compared to other Starbucks.   When there are 8 or so employees, you'd think that the place would run like an efficient, well-oiled machine. Nope....

REVIEW #3:  4 stars  (2157 chars)
24 hour sratbucks - awesome. Fremont street people watching - awesome. Finding a seat - not so awesome. Plugs for laptop - non existent. Not even a plug inside. I guess they don't want me plugging in my amp for my one man band Fremont show. I'm suprised, because they let everyone else besides Starbucks customers chill here.  ...  ... Is it really that hard to put a sign up that reads "starbucks or hotel guests only". As much as I like quircky vagrants, I do not enjoy them asking me for cigarettes and change every 5 minutes. I'm trying to enjoy my chai frap and watch people take pictures with the big titty lady. People watching is a lot less amusing when you have the drunk guy who thinks he IS the Fremont street experience sitting next to you. Double fisting two natty ices. He definitely was not there to purchase a scone or double shot espresso. Out of the 11 full tables outside, I counted only 3 Starbucks products. In the freeloaders defense, there are no benches or chairs on Fremont street to sit down. I'm guessing zoning only allows zero benches and 60 vendor carts. Gotta make that money Vegas! ...  ... This Starbucks does not accept my Starbucks card. For a company that is not a franchise, why allow casino and rest area locations to have different rules and rediculous prices? I don't know who's at fault. Are these "special" locations gouging prices or is it Starbucks corp? If I find out its the latter, I'm turning in my Starbucks GOLD card. Gonna start my own mega-espresso empire with consistency at every location. Treating my loyal customers with the respect they deserve for keeping me in business. ...  ... I have been here for at least an hour and the sitting area looks like they started their own refuse collection. Nobody has come outside to clean up the place. I'm about to leave and some guy that looks like a meth addict starts clearing up the tables and the ground. Maybe OCD, or maybe he just wants to be a nice guy for using the tables without purchasing anything from starbucks. Who said meth addicts can't be contributing members of society? They are doing more than the starbucks/casino employees that work here.

A Sure Thing! I adore coffee, all kinds:  I am not too fussy. My coffee is very blond and very sweet:  more like dessert. Almost a meal, but not quite. Hope you enjoy yours too!

REVIEW #5:  4 stars  (706 chars)
I mean, yeah, right, it's a Starbucks. How different can they be? And, it's true. On the drink/food side- it's the same as just about any Starbucks.  ...  ... BUT- For some odd reason, there really aren't any restaurants that have a patio ON Fremont street. Starbucks does. So, it's worth the price of a cappuccino to be able to people watch from their lovely patio. And, to be honest, they don't seem to really police that you're a customer of theirs in order to be able to sit there. Dude next to me was drinking coffee from Dunkin' Donuts.  ...  ... Only negative is street performers and random salespeople (timeshares, etc.) can bug you from time to time. Whatev. Just pretend you don't speak English.

Small but comfortable Starbucks inside the Golden Nugget casino, outdoor seating on the Fremont St pedestrian mall is a nice feature.

REVIEW #7:  4 stars  (414 chars)
This SB is located in the Golden Nugget downtown Las Vegas it's very small just like your typical stand in a Casino to get a quick drink. So happy that now you can use your SB card before you couldn't use it. They don't have the phone scanner don't know when that will happen. But I forgot the Golden Nugget has 2 SB the other one is located in the newer redone section. I'm just glad now they accept the SB cards.

This Starbucks made THE BEST Cinnamon Dolce Latte that I have ever had! I was in Vegas in the middle of summer, and it was ridiculously hot but I still had to have my cinnamon dolce latte. The lady who filled my families orders was very friendly, and did an amazing job on all of our drinks. If only the baristas in Utah could take a lesson from her!

REVIEW #9:  4 stars  (1768 chars)
While walking along the Fremont Street Experience on my earlier jaunts to view the famed Fremont Street Experience Light Show years ago, I got thirsty for a nice, hot coffee. It was a cold October day. Lo and behold, this Starbucks Coffee Shop situated inside the Golden Nugget Casino Hotel in Downtown "Old Vegas" was the answer to my beverage thirst. ...  ... Oh, goodness: ... I recommend this not only for that great coffee Starbucks is known for but for the spectacular spectacle for any scenery-watching and sightseer like me is this location's relaxed seating on its outside patio. ...  ... Seatings and tables surrounded by a wrought iron fixture surround which wraps this patio right on the Fremont Street Experience pavement. I sat and watched the light show drinking my coffee and a pastry treat! Several visits followed thereafter, when friends and family is in the city to relish the spectacle of the Light Show and this place presents a seated outdoors "theatre experience".  ...  ... The staff service is attentive and prompt.  ...  ... A cozy little coffee shop with seatings inside the shop, too.  ...  ... Besides the coffee, I like their cheesecake, chocolate eclairs and fruit tarts all at a price between $2.95-3.95... a little on the above-average pricing.  ...  ... What, not tech-y? ... My most recent visit was this month to meet my Mom, I have found out that one thing that this Starbucks is not up-to-date for is the absence of "Free Wi-Fi" unlike other locations in the U.S.  ...  ... Note this: ... There are two locations of Starbucks in Golden Nugget. The other is in The South Tower but it opens only from 5a.m.-10p.m.  Best yet eversince with THIS LOCATION OVERLOOKS the Fremont Street Experience, this coffee shop stays OPEN 24 HOURS!

REVIEW #11:  3 stars  (724 chars)
Here are the real facts about this sbux:  ...  ... It is a 24/7 coffee shop with pretty good customer service & fast drink making skills, but extremely average drinks. I got a Java Chip Frap and there was barely any coffee whatsoever! Though, it is in a pretty useful location when you decide to go exploring downtown Las Vegas!  ...  ... It's a tad more expensive because of the casino status. Also, don't ever eat food at starbucks--it's usually bland or dry, and you should really save your money for more coffee trips or alcohol later when you're trying to have some good times in the ol' DTLV.  ...  ... My suggestion: Grab your drink and walk around fremont @ night! It's worth the fun light show view~! At least once!

Hey starbucks! Same. as. always. Nothing great, nothing bad, but damn I love those Chai Tea Lattes!

REVIEW #13:  3 stars  (494 chars)
I made a stop here every single day while on a recent trip out to Las Vegas.  With its great location, it made it so convenient to get my Starbucks fix in daily.  Their baristas were all super friendly, no matter who was working when I stopped by.  ...  ... I still can't figure out why they would still be using their holiday/Christmas cups on February 8th but they were.  It didn't matter. My venti Sugar Free Cinnamon Dolce Soy Latte was out of this world and hit the spot every single time.

REVIEW #14:  3 stars  (942 chars)
This is a pretty small location, although that is to be expected since it is inside the Golden Nugget. There is an outdoor patio so you can enjoy your coffee while people watching on Fremont Street. The line can get long, but the staff is really nice and work fast. I got my coffee really fast despite how busy it was. ...  ... The  reason I had to take off a few stars is that they do not take the Starbucks card and do not give Starbucks rewards members any of the benefits. This was the only Starbucks I went to in Las Vegas that did that and the others I had gone to were in casinos as well. I can understand not wanting to be part of Starbucks rewards, but I don't see how hard it would be to take Starbucks cards since they already accept credit and debit cards. I could have gotten coffee somewhere else, but I made the effort to go here just because it was a Starbucks so I was disappointed that I couldn't pay with my Starbucks card.

REVIEW #15:  3 stars  (104 chars)
Watch out, this Starbucks is more expensive than normal Starbucks locations because its tourist central.

REVIEW #16:  2 stars  (1289 chars)
I don't think I've ever given a Starbucks a bad review.... because, well, they're Starbucks and they're the same the world over, right? ...  ... One would think. ...  ... The drinks are more money here, but that's because they're inside a casino and they can get away with gouging the tourists.  Fine, okay, I expect a certain level of that.  But... this is the ONLY Starbucks I have ever been to where they did NOT have any Wifi access.  And I mean none at all, not even a "paid" level.  Nothing.  I desperately needed a Wifi connection to upload an assignment for grad school - you would think I could do it here over a cup of coffee.   ...  ... That would be a negative.  Most likely because it would "compete" with the Wifi access that the casinos offer - which, of course, you have to pay for (at least, in my case, I did).  This is NOT COOL, folks. ...  ... I have NEVER seen a Starbucks without Wifi access before... but I have now.  I'm not likely to come back, especially when you can't even get a seat outside half the time because it's jam-packed.  And they sit for hours, hours, hours.  If you don't have Wifi access here, there is NO need to sit here for 12 hours taking up space - drink your overpriced lattes and LEAVE so someone else can sit down. ...  ... Not recommended.

REVIEW #17:  2 stars  (297 chars)
Like previous reviews, the service sucks and not the greatest areas of town. I usually get the norm for me which is a jcf...this place is always busy and they do have a tendency to skip orders...not the best way to run a business. I guess I'll deal with crummy service vs waiting at a coffee shop.

REVIEW #18:  2 stars  (453 chars)
OK, 3 mornings in a row dealing with a nice cashier, but a grumpy sourpuss making our espresso drinks.  If you are going to work in the service industry, don't bring the bad attitude to work. ...  ... Additionally, why, as a paying customer, am I not getting a seat on the patio because the patio is full of bums and non-customers?  Seriously, Friday and Saturday morning the patio was full, but only 2 people had a Starbucks drink.   ...  ... Not good.

REVIEW #19:  2 stars  (444 chars)
One of the few places to get espressos and lattes in the downtown LV area. It's a small location with limited choices of pastries (at leasts the few times I have been there). It's on the Fremont side of the Golden Nugget which has another one on the Carson side. This one tends to be less crowded in the morning as the one on the Carson side is the near the place where people wait to hop back on their tour bus and take a coffee while waiting.

REVIEW #20:  2 stars  (86 chars)

Shitty service! I was staying at the Golden Nugget and while waiting on our husband to pull up the car we were parched from the 100+ degree heat and I asked for just a small cup of water. ...

Each time I went in there, no one else was in there and my drinks were made very promptly. The staff was friendly and my drink tasted very good.

on day 4 of our trip I finally realized this Starbucks is here at the MGM  - dang! could have been enjoying my usual beverage everyday/ Oh, well, found it now.  Located in Tower 1 - this Starbucks doesn't have any lines to speak of compared to the one in the MGM food court area. I ordered a Venti Vanilla Macchiato with No Foam. It was great. The Baristas were very nice and I had no problem using my Starbucks phone app to pay for my drinks. It's not a cheap Starbucks. You're paying for convenience, don't like it, stand in line for an hour in the MGM Starbucks.

REVIEW #3:  4 stars  (433 chars)
I give this Starbucks four stars because it's considerably bigger than a usual Starbucks that you find in casinos - most of the ones around the Strip are the Target-sized Starbucks.  You know what I mean.  This one is almost normal-sized.  Also, the lady who worked behind the counter was nice and cheery and commiserated with me about the change in style of the 'You Are Here' mugs.. the old blue ones are definitely better, right??

Sometimes at the little places, like inside the hotel, these kind of Starbucks places are more like the red headed step child of the others. I can confidently say this location fits in with the rest of the family. ...  ... They have all the favorites and classics. And they are open 24 hours!  ...  ... If I am staying at the Westin again, I will certainly be stopping in for an overpriced, high caloric coffee that Starbucks is known for.

Sometimes craziness strikes me and I push myself to attend work out classes at 6am even though I went to bed late. Then their are times that I might be going completely insane and attend two classes. Unfortunately, they never fit back to back and I have a large lag time in between. The combination of lack of sleep and early wake up made it clear that I needed caffeine.  ...  ... At 8am, I was able to avoid the morning rush. The store was almost full, but I found a spot to sit and read the newspaper. A grande Americano will only set you back $2 and change while not ruining all the efforts of the gym. Passing up on those pastries prove to be difficult, but a sugar spike was not on my agenda. At this point, the cashier could guess that I was struggling to not give in. She didn't push it and I was in the clear.  ...  ... The staff members are efficient. A second after my money was in the register, my coffee was on the counter. With the mellow sounds of Seal drifting above, I was ready to pick up and head off to yoga.

REVIEW #7:  4 stars  (724 chars)
This location is located inside of the Westin hotel and is open 24 hours a day. Because that is the first thing I need in Vegas at 4am is caffeine.  ...  ... The location was not crowded and there were plenty of seats too. I think they also might have free wifi because there was a lot of laptop activity going on here.  ...  ... The oatmeal was good but they only filled it up about 2/3rd's...felt like a total rip off.  I put it on my list to never order again. The room had coffee in it, so I made my own every morning.  I did pick up breakfast here every morning. The turkey sandwich was good and I also liked the bluberry vanilla fiber bar.  This place also had the cold double shot...one of my favorite Starbuck items!

REVIEW #12:  3 stars  (276 chars)
pretty much your typical starbuck's. It's in a casino so some mornings there were people sleeping at the tables, but I guess that is to be expected in vegas! When we arrived before 9 it was usually pretty quick, but 9 am or so the line started getting very long and very slow.

This Starbucks is located inside of the Westin Causarina Hotel and Casino.  Since it's not a regular Starbucks it doesn't accept your Starbucks phone apps or give you stars.  Big bummer for me. ...  ... As far as service goes it's okay, they are not the fastest if there is a line building up, but they usually are friendly.  The selection of food items can be limited and that again can be a bummer for me too. ...  ... Overall, it's an okay Starbucks, nothing special.  It's not a legit Starbucks so you don't get your Gold card perks either. :(  Also I think it is slightly more expensive that a normal Starbucks too. ...  ... YELP REVIEW CHALLENGE #23/31

I just love having a nearby Starbucks! ...  ... There is no drive-thru at this location They have an outdoor patio and the landscape around it has nice lush trees and plants which makes it nice to kick back with a book or magazine and sip on your fav beverage and or snack. I love the service here too. It is nice when you walk in and they know you by name. I'm sure if I didn't order 1 of 5 different things depending on my mood, they would remember what I wanted too! ...  ... I long for when the Holidays arrive and the "Cranberry Bliss Bar" is on the menu! I stock up and buy the box of them :) ...  ... Even if coffee isn't your thing, they still have teas and fruit smoothies. The "Green Tea" here is good. I usually go with the "White Chocolate Mocha" (like I did this last visit) or "Caramel Frappuccino" with extra caramel lined inside the cup! ...  ... Don't forget to register your Starbucks card online to get freebies and earn rewards. I got a free coffee on my birthday and earn a star every time I purchase a coffee which helps towards my rewards.

I liked the friendly service and the customers were a happy bunch. In decent weather, sitting on the patio is the best. I only found this particulate Starbucks because I was receiving medical treatment nearby. As a result, I was always in some pain, not medicated, except by this above average coffee shop.

I visit Summerlin a couple times a year for a week or so at a time and I go to this Sbux daily - they often remember my drink and my name even though I'm not local.  And they get both right every time!

REVIEW #5:  5 stars  (324 chars)
I wish this place had a drive through- but service is always quick and pleasant so I don't mind going in. The outdoor area is so charming. They never get the drinks wrong.  I can't say enough good things about the service- in particular there is one dark-haired woman that is so sweet, she makes me smile every time I go in.

Most Starbucks are marked with good quality drinks, snacks, and pastries. This locale in the Village Center definitely possesses such trusted qualities!  ...  ... What could set a Starbucks locale  apart are (1) interior/exterior space, (2) availability of drive-thru service; (3) adequacy of staffing; (4) maintenance of restrooms. ...  ... - I absolutely love its ATTRACTIVE, TIERED, SPACIOUS PATIOS, which are wheelchair friendly. ... - Its interior is not big, but adequate. Oh yes, it has free wifi.  ... - This place always has adequate, efficient, friendly, and PATIENT baristas.  ... - I have been coming over here for years, and I always find its men's room CLEAN and WELL MAINTAINED - a BIG Plus! This point is important to me, because baristas use the SAME restrooms. One can imagine, if... ...  ... By the way, this place is conveniently located near the Summerlin library, the Village Trail Park and baseball fields, Vons, eateries, and many other businesses. ...  ... The only drawback (to some) might be its lack of drive-thru service, although it does not bother me. ...  ... Peter May 2013 ... PS:  ... - I know this popular locale does not really need another review, especially from me, but Yelp keeps on reminding me to do that, probably because I Yelped out a TIP on this locale once?

My favorite Starbucks that  I have EVER been to.  ... Drinks are made to perfection. ... This location is has super friendly service. The outdoor area is FABULOUS. It is so great that you can even bring your dog there. If you bring your dog, the staff brings them water. ... I look forward to returning here again and again.

My savior in the mornings, Being new to town I immediately sought out this nice corner spot!  What a great change from my old strip mall drive thru starbucks in the chicago suburbs, the atmosphere is cheery, the staff patient and so nice and the outside sitting area allows you to sit back relax and forget the hustle of everyday life. By far one of the best all around starbucks I have been to!

REVIEW #9:  5 stars  (1026 chars)
This is the Starbucks at the Hillpoint center that was practically set up for Summerlin residents only. It's really well hidden, and it closes really early unlike other locations.  ...  ... This is probably my favorite Starbucks in the world. The workers here are really nice and always complement the clothes I'm wearing.  Also, they really know how to make a good Latte. The Starbucks which is closer to my house also has friendly workers but the coffee always tastes like it was made by a new hire. The workers here are all world class when it comes to making the perfect coffee-beverage. I don't mind the extra 5 minute drive to get to this location on account of the great service.  ...  ... I also like the lineup of unusual dogs that the Summerlin residents always bring here. Sure, the dog owners bring those dogs to Starbucks in an attempt to attract the attention of young girls, but unfortunately for them they get my attention instead. Today I got to play with a Shiba Inu and yesterday I got to pet a St. Bernard.

A good Starbucks to hang out. The WiFi is always up and the staff is friendly. While I love their coffee, I'm not a fan of the pastries. Next door is an Einsteins Bagels, and their pastries are pretty good. The seating is good indoors and outdoors.

REVIEW #12:  4 stars  (290 chars)
Best Starbucks in the USA! ...  ... HUGE location, tons of outdoor seating, lots of indoor seating and tables.  The service is extra good, and quick at this Starbucks!  It's located in one of the nicest areas of Las Vegas, upscale clientele and nice looking girls (extra points given).  ;-)

REVIEW #13:  4 stars  (635 chars)
I've been to about a dozen Starbucks in Las Vegas.  The large outdoor seating area is what makes this location my favorite.   ...  ... Unlike most Starbucks (and other coffee shops around town) there is ample outdoor seating here.  You can have your choice of a spot in the sun, or in the shade of the surrounding trees and architecture.  It's especially pleasant to sit outdoors in the fall and spring months. ...  ... The indoor seating area is also very nice, with a choice of table chairs or lounge chairs.   ...  ... I have no complaints with the baristas, who are always friendly and prepare my caffe americano the way I like it.

REVIEW #15:  4 stars  (589 chars)
Located in the heart of the original part of Summerlin, this Starbucks is one of my favorite locations.  Here's why: ...  ... - They have a large outdoor seating area.  With plenty of outdoor seats, this location is great to hang out during the Spring & Fall seasons when the weather is awesome in Vegas. ...  ... - FREE WiFi.  I know it's FREE at all Starbucks, but it's worth mentioning it anyway. ...  ... - Good service.  The employees here are always friendly and get my order right every time. ...  ... Overall, I always have a good experience here. ...  ... Will I return?  You bet.

Pictures on my blog.. ...  ... This past Friday night I drove to Las Vegas for my goddaughter's first birthday party. Wow, I cannot believe it's been one year already. We totally rocked the house at Chuck E Cheese!  ...  ... While visiting I also stopped by my favorite Starbucks location in Summerlin for a walk down memory lane with my friend Brandy.  ...  ... I love this location because of the ample parking.. the familiar dog that has been going there for like 7 years, and all the other things near it.. plus, it's huge!

REVIEW #18:  4 stars  (578 chars)
Super friendly staff here.  But no drive through.  They sell the hot sandwiches, which I always appreciate.  They also have a customer of the month... which is a little embarrassing.  This month it's a dog.  I'm sure the dog is cool with being customer of the month.  But personally, if my name popped up on that sign, I'd be mortified.  Don't tell the world about my sugar/caffeine addiction! ...  ... Summerlin folk seem to like to hang out here with their kids, so be prepared for that.  Also, it can get a little crowded - this is a popular spot, especially on the weekends.

REVIEW #19:  4 stars  (360 chars)
The service here as always been prompt and the drinks were made appropriately. What I like about this location is the outdoor patio. The store is located on the corner with the patio out front surrounding the store. So there is a wide view with a lot of trees and greenery. The intersection is right there but it's not that busy. It's nice to sit outside here.

REVIEW #20:  4 stars  (426 chars)
This has to be one of the best Starbucks in the area.  There is a lot of seating outdoors when the temperature warrants.  The indoor seating area is a bit larger than most, bit it's the outside patio area where this Starbucks shines. ...  ... The staff here has always been very good.  The quantity of food on hand is ample to meet their high demand.  ...  ... It's a pleasure to come here. ...  ... There is no drive through.

REVIEW #21:  4 stars  (402 chars)
This is a cool Starbucks , great atmosphere , tons of seating inside and out . Staff are fine , they remember my name and I only go once a week. They've got a dog bowl for Ozzy , wifi works , they pick up the old newspapers and clear the tables . No drive thru so when I'm starting a road trip with the family I do the Lake Mead / Rampart Starbucks. Very popular with local hot moms so dress nice guys!

REVIEW #22:  4 stars  (525 chars)
This is one of the best Starbucks in town.  The service is always friendly and fast.  In the mornings around 7 am, I am in and out with my drink within 5 minutes or less.  The inside is smaller compared to other Starbucks with about 8 small tables.  The best part of this Starbucks though is the outside patio, where people hang out and relax. ...  ... My only thing with this Starbucks is that around 10 am - 1 pm, all of the soccer moms with their army of kids like to visit at this time making the service a little slower.

REVIEW #23:  4 stars  (644 chars)
This Starbucks is what my friend refers to as "The Pretty Starbucks".  It is in the Village Trails Center in Summerlin and has a very inviting, large patio.  Many people come sit on the patio with their dogs and just hang out.  Old, retired people come and shoot the ish with each other for hours out there. ...  ... Inside, they are pretty busy, but very quick with their service.  Their food display is always stocked if you're looking for pastries or their warm sandwiches (hello bacon, egg, and gouda sandwich), which is nice because some Starbucks, especially the ones inside grocery stores, are severly lacking in their cafe food options.

REVIEW #24:  3 stars  (138 chars)
Gorgeous patio seating!!  Cashiers were very nice and thorough although it did take a hot minute for our drinks and we were first in line.

REVIEW #25:  3 stars  (1355 chars)
This could be a great Starbucks.  They sure have the potential:  great wi-fi, spacious interior, and the best patio space of any Starbucks for miles.  On this visit the staff was very friendly and helpful.  So why do I give it only three stars?? ...  ... BECAUSE THIS IS  VEGAS, BABY, AND THIS JOINT CLOSES AT 8:00 pm.  Make that on weekends, too.  Yeah, I know why, but I hardly believe it.  "Volume," said the guy at the register.  I was there at 7:45, and by the time my beans had been ground and I put all the stuff into my hot coffee, it was 8:00.  My "day" was just beginning.   ...  ... The door wasn't yet locked, but a customer coming in was told the store was closed.  He left.  A minute later another one came in who was obviously a regular and known to the staff.  He was not told the store was closed, and proceeded to place a large order, which was filled.  As soon as he left, a third customer was turned away.  Okay, so maybe they're not lining up out the door at 8:00 p.m., but it was a weeknight and there WERE customers.  I just don't get it.  I can walk to this store, but noooooo.  If it's 8:15 and I my caffeine addiction kicks in, I have to get in the car and drive.  Or stay home and make it in my handy Melitta one-cup manual drip cone.   ...  ... Double razzberry to this Starbucks location.  Howard Schultz, I could've loved it.

REVIEW #26:  2 stars  (558 chars)
I love Starbucks but this one is not so great. It's strange when there isn't a line and it's so LOUD that it's impossible to relax and/or get any homework done. It's always full of annoying kids. The only reason I keep going back is because it's literally 3 mins away from my place and the staff is super friendly and they usually do a good job making my coffee. They also have a nice outdoor seating area but I can never use it because it's usually too hot outside and lately it has been unusually cold. I really wish they had a drive-thru at this location!

REVIEW #27:  2 stars  (1808 chars)
This has gone from being the best Starbucks in Las Vegas to one of the worst.  ...  ... The service tends to be on the rude side these days.  ...  ... They close extremely early. While most Starbucks close at 10, this place closes like at 7 or 8.  ...  ... There is never any tables open if you want to use the wifi. The same people loiter here all day long, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  ...  ... My last drink here tasted like some guy  grabbed a stale cookie, crushed it in the palm of his hand, and dropped it into water mixed with chocolate syrup. It didn't even taste like coffee.  ...  ... There is no such thing as half n half here.  ...  ... It's so loud in here that you have to scream in order for the barista to hear you.  ...  ... It's so loud in here that you won't hear the barista scream your name when your drink is ready.  ...  ... There is a group  of middle-age men who sit outside with their puppies in order to get the attention of cutie-pie teenage girls. These guys have been doing this for so long that the puppies are now full grown dogs.  ...  ... Also remember how this is Summerlin so everyone acts like they are 11 years old. They will complain about every little thing. If you are standing in line, the guys behind you will constantly keep bitching about how they hate waiting in line. This happens at every Summerlin business I go to. Why are Summerlin folks so impatient?  ...  ... The parking lot in this particular area of the shopping center is very cramped. Either these people drive really bad or they are confused and think that this Starbucks has a drive-thru. I don't know how many times I narrowly avoided death in this parking lot.   ...  ... These days I go to the Starbucks in Centennial near Floyd Lamb Park. The internet is much quicker, and they close at 10.

This Starbucks is a great place to hang if you can get past the horrible workers!!! They have the worst customer service out of any location. Even if you mention this location to other Starbucks they even will tell you it has the worst service! They are so concerned with themselves and will be chatting away while the line is to the door!!!

I love Starbucks.  I ingest it by IV permanently attached through a port under my chin.   ...  ... Most of the time I buy it by the pound and make it at home.  I always buy it at a Starbucks store, never at the supermarket, because that never tastes the same.   ...  ... Of all the Starbucks on all the corners near me, this one on Rampart has consistently been the friendliest and most helpful.  (The details shall remain a closely guarded secret, lest the employees there get into trouble, and then it won't necessarily be my favorite Starbucks any more).

REVIEW #2:  5 stars  (278 chars)
This has got to be the coolest Starbucks I have been to. The drive thru offers a screen so you can see the person taking your order.  It is so personal and I love it!  Every time I go through the employees and super nice and accommodating as well. I love going to this location.

REVIEW #3:  5 stars  (306 chars)
This is the second closest Starbucks to my home and I use it when I'm on the road because of the Drive-Thru.  ...  ... Always consistent and I feel it necessary to compliment Michelle who has worked here for many years and knows all the regulars including my dogs. And they have never even bought anything!

REVIEW #4:  5 stars  (363 chars)
Today is free coffee day for Earth Day. I bring my travel mug - a big one, of course. They're only brewing that Pike Place swill, since it's late afternoon. "Do you want me to brew Bold?  I can do that," the barista says. Other Starbucks wouldn't be so willing, especially since I won't be paying. That's what makes this location a 5-star joint in my book. Kudos.

REVIEW #5:  4 stars  (517 chars)
Came here to meet a colleague today for coffee.  It's a nice location with ample seating and of course FREE WiFi.  The staff here is friendly and the big bonus is that the other patrons are nice too.....I've been to some Starbucks in Vegas where I didn't care for the other customers as they were very rude and filthy. ...  ... There is also ample power outlets for your laptop and the spacing between tables is comfortable, not cramped. ...  ... Will I return?  I think I found my new hangout spot in the afternoons.

REVIEW #6:  4 stars  (246 chars)
Friendly staff and VERY near Labcorp so when I have blood work done, this is a small drive away to recharge my caffeine level. ...  ... I got my normal quad espresso over ice.  How can they make that wrong?  Tasty--you bet! ...  ... I'll be back!

REVIEW #7:  4 stars  (1038 chars)
Let's put a Starbucks with a drive through right on your route to work... diabolical. I'm not a big coffee drinker but I am trying (and failing) to drink green tea so this is a good place to get my fix. So far I have been lucky and haven't encountered any super long drive through lines (I'm not going to get out of my car after all- I'll go to the gym if I want to work out) but maybe I just get there at super awesome times? Or maybe anytime I'm there it by definition becomes a super awesome time? Probably. ...  ... I also like the drive through because I can order a strawberries and cream frappacino and not have to go pick it up in front of everyone- feeling all those eyes on me, judging me, and the laughter- oh how they laugh... Real men drink pink drinks people- get used to it it's the 21st century and no it is not correlated with the decline of America as a super power.  ...  ... Anywhoo, sometimes I have 6-8 hours to kill so I come here with my macbook to work on my screenplay and order only water. Nice little Saturday.

REVIEW #8:  4 stars  (201 chars)
This location is good. The service is friendly! The establishment needs trash cans on the outside, one for convenience, secondly to help prevent the trash being strewn on the ground in the parking-lot.

REVIEW #9:  3 stars  (442 chars)
Drive thru coffee is an interesting game.  ...  ... Each experience is always different, one time the line is long and it takes forever and sometimes It has zero lines and still take forever. ...  ... The drive thru at this Starbucks on average is pretty good. Most my experiences here are through the drive thru. A lot of the time they have a nice line but it seems as they have it together with quick service and pretty prompt great coffee.

REVIEW #10:  2 stars  (2062 chars)
Being an ex Starbucks partner, I know the rules and regulations, and after so many times of going to this Starbucks, the last few have not been so pleasant. My first complaint is that when I try to order my items, I feel completely rushed and barely able to finish a sentence before I am interrupted and told my total. I usually order more then one thing. So it becomes a bit frustrating. The second complaint that I have is.. When did white mochas stop coming with whip cream? I could have sworn it is regulation to put whip cream on it unless the customer asks for no whip. After this happening a few times, I started asking for it In my order. It still would come out without the whip. So then it's been having to take a few steps back and add the whip but that one is pretty petty and easily fixed, so I'm not too worried about it. My last complaint is the customer service I have received today. This was kind of the cherry on top. Yesterday I got a ham and cheese artisan and it was wrong. I took it anyways because I was already on the way to work, and I understand we are all human and make mistakes. So today when I ordered, I double checked it at the window. Thank god I did because it wasn't even a ham and cheese artisan. It was bacon Gouda. After letting the drive through know, Robert and the other partner just kind of looked at me in aw and stared for two minutes. Robert finally was like we are out of ham. That should have been stated when I was ordering. Let me mind you it was not busy. So now I'm sitting in my car holding it, telling them I don't want it, and they were acting like it was my fault and that I was stuck with it. Finally he offered me a refund and I was already going to be late for work. So I asked for a experience card instead of the refund so I could get on my way, and he said no we cannot do that, and insisted the refund. I'm extremely disappointed because I feel like the whole situation was just plain off rude, and I know it's pretty unacceptable partner behavior. That will be the last time I go to that Starbucks.

I lived in the northwest for a while and am use to my Big Foot coffee or my Woods coffee. This is Garbage coffee I mean DD or MCD does better. I ordered a carmel ice coffee and I don't know why I tasted it but it was burn't tasting either over roasting the beans or something. I could only do about to sips. I should of went with my orig idea on drove a little further down on mead to the tulley place at least there its good.

I came here to telecommute and do some work. The CES expo is happening right down the street, so I expected it to be totally slammed. It's not! Plenty of room. Fast service. Friendly staff.  ...  ... If you want a "Starbucks experience", the location on Paradise is no exception (even for being this close to the strip). No surprises here.

Looking to get away from douchebags, drunks and addicted gamblers?  Tired of sorority girls holding back the hair while their sister pukes in a trash can?  Ditch the casinos and lounges and slip into this Starbucks if you need to recharge.  I am not really a fan of Starbucks, but I needed some power, and a place to just chill out and work and this one is perfect for that. ...  ... Usually when you get off the strip you'll encounter all those people that the numerous billboards in Vegas seem to be targeting - you know the ones that say "DUI?!" or "Need to get clean?" ...  ... Well none of those people are in this Starbucks either! ...  ... It's just a nice, clean, mellow spot to feel like you are in any other suburban coffee shop even though you are actually in Sin City!

My girl and I stopped here for some java just after eating lunch at India Oven (read the review) and this Starbucks seemed moderately busy but not too crowded. ...  ... The Java was great; I had the Pumpkin Spice Latte as I have had for about 4 days straight. My girl stated that I would soon be getting withdraw symptoms once the seasonal items change....zomg. My girl had the new Salted Caramel Hot Chocolate but she had hers iced, which she feels it would after having it that way taste better hot. ...  ... The only thing negative about this one today was the rest room was a bit dirty with black grim all over the floors in the men's bathroom. It was not so busy I feel that they should have been checking the bathroom regularly. ...  ... On a side note, I saw a homeless person come in and ask for some water, which they promptly gave him with no hassles. (Yes I know they legally have to but it lets me forgive them about the bathroom. ;p) ...  ...  ... Best Regards, ... James "Culinary Schmooze" Williams

A Starbucks is a Starbucks, right? Well, yeah.  But no.  This place has become my go-to for morning coffee/soy latte because A) the one that was actually right on my way to work closed, B) they have a drive-thru, and C) .... that's about it. ...  ... This place is always PACKED.  It's insane to try and get in/out of the parking lot.  But on the bright side, they have the friendliest drive thru people ever.  So, it's a +1/-1 star on that.  ...  ... This one is pretty small on the inside with a limited amount of seating, but the drive-thru line usually moves pretty fast.  Good option if you're in the neighborhood and in a hurry.

I came here with Don the other night around 8pm to study. The location is pretty good since it's right next to the strip, but the area isn't so great. The second Don stepped out of his car, some homeless man approached him and started talking about how his brake lights are out. Then that little comment turned into a whole talk about how his wife is pregnant and sick, blah blah blah. Of course, it all ended with the guy asking Don for some money. Once he walked away, we checked the brake lights and they were fine. I guess it's just another tactic people are using so it could seem like they're helping you out, so you should give them something in return.  ...  ... Anyways, about this Starbucks. The location is okay. I didn't have any problem with traffic at all or getting into the parking lot. Since there were only a few customers there, we were able to find a table right away. It wasn't just any table either, it was one right next to a couple outlets for us to use! Woohoo. I ordered the Awake hot tea and Don ordered Calm hot tea. At other Starbucks locations, the Awake that I'd get would have me feeling pretty cracked out and unable to sleep, but it didn't do anything for me at all here. I actually felt like I was getting more tired. I don't see how that could be their fault though since the tea comes in containers and they don't have to do any sort of ingredients mixing at all to make it.  ...  ... Tips: ... *If you have the option, come at night. It's way more chill ... *Make sure you lock the top lock in the bathroom!! I walked in one some lady pulling down her pants!!

Quick service but not full Starbucks products available. They had a limited number of drinks - I guess thats ok, as they were located inside the convention center. ...  ...

This Starbucks Gold Card holder is not impressed with this location.  ... It's a pain to get in and out of most of the time.  ... An iced caffe mocha, no whip, extra shot always seems to get messed up when ordering it from here.  ... Service was aloof and kinda had a I don't give a dang about you, just let me get through with my shift and get the heck out of here attitude.  ...  ... If you need caffeine this place will suffice. Barely.  ...  ... One plus...it's a short walk from the Sahara Monorail Station so if you are wanting a break from say being stuck at the Convention Center and have a Monorail pass it's worth taking a ride to get to. That's why it gets 3 stars and not 2.

REVIEW #14:  3 stars  (886 chars)
This Starbucks is ok in a pinch. Ive gone here countless times and they usually ALWAYS mess up! Lately though, its been pretty ok! The cashiers in the DT are pretty decent, but the DT itself is a shit show. If you dont enter from the Sahara side and try to go in from the Paradise side youre pretty much screwed. Stupid ppl, including myself on occasion, think they can enter and do a u turn to get into the dt line. IT DOESNT WORK IF THERE ARE PPL IN THE DT PPL! I WILL NOT LET YOU GET IN FRONT OF ME BC YOU DIDNT TAKE AN EXTRA MINUTE TO DRIVE DOWN SAHARA AND COME IN THE CORRECT WAY LIKE I DID! ...  ... Like I said, in a pinch! The inside is large and spacious and the workers inside are pretty nice as well. They have the assortment of mech on display/for sale and the couches are super comfy! ...  ... Im sure Ill continue putting myself through the punishment for my iced coffees!

I come here quite a bit because of its proximity to my office, and honestly it has the potential to be a great Starbucks, but for some reason they put the guy with the least customer service at the counter! The short bald/almost bald guy there every weekday morning just ruins the entire transaction consistently, by his rudeness and screwed up orders, but I guess there's got to be some good reason he's at the counter?  I prefer the Starbucks  down the street in Howard Hughes.

I've been a loyal Starbucks customer since 2006. This is the worst Starbucks location I've ever been to. I've never gone inside this location. I've gotten coffee from this location three times. And not a single time was I happy with their service. The only reason I went to this location was because they have a drive-thru and it makes it more convinient for me (most of the ones in the area doesn't have a drive-thru). I've given this location three shots and that is it! I am done... I am never, ever, ever coming back to this location ever again! The last time I was there was Wednesday, April 17th. I was on my way to my dentist appointment and since it was still early I would love to get coffee and just kill some time. There was at least 5 cars in front of me, which is fine because I don't care about the wait for I have an hour to kill anyway. So I ordered my usual Venti iced caramel macchiato with extra caramel. There is no screen where you can see your order and this guy on the register didn't bother repeating if my order was correct. So I went ahead and drive up and when I got to the window he was handing me a "grande". So I told him I ordered a venti. Then he asked if I don't mind if it's stirred or not. Right when I said I don't mind if it's stirred, I just knew it! I knew they would just pour the grande drink in the venti cup and add lots of ice. And that's exactly what happened! That's not how you do business and definitely not how you keep your business! This location is an embarrasment to Starbucks! I've gone to other locations in another city, state and even another country for Starbucks and never was I this disappointed to Starbucks. This location gives Starbucks the worst reputation. It doesn't deserve to carry it's name!

REVIEW #19:  1 stars  (468 chars)
This location has been the worst starbucks experience I've had. Customer service there is horrible, they also had to remake my favorite drink 3 times because it didn't taste right! The drive thru is the worst as well, it seems like the person taking care of the orders, don't know what he's doing. I had to wait at least 5 mins to be helped. In other words, it's been a horrible experience for me, I wouldn't recommend anybody to come here at all. It's a nightmare!!!!

After an 8 mile bike ride along the Flamingo Wash, I used Yelp to find the nearest Starbucks and this was it.  I don't generally do drive throughs so I parked in their small lot and went inside the store. ...  ... I ordered my drink, it was ready quickly, and I enjoyed part of it while checking my email on their free wifi.   ...  ... The staff was very pleasant and on the ball.  I can't say I'll be stopping here often, but it fit my needs yesterday!

Friendly staff. The parking lot is kinda small. And the inside is small too. But the WIFI is fast. Nothing is wrong with the area like others say.

REVIEW #4:  4 stars  (542 chars)
I am not a huge Starbucks fan and refuse to become a Starbucks Whore but since the wife and I started the low carb lifestyle this has been a savior to us on those Saturday afternoons.... My order is as follows: Venti Iced Coffee with a squirt of sugar free vanilla and half and half... SO GOOD!! This is our go to location right now for work and we get it about 1 time a week and it id always spot on.. You cant really screw up iced coffee so I am happy with it for now. It was in my frappacino days that I was slowly turned off by Starbucks!

REVIEW #5:  4 stars  (581 chars)
They are generally pretty quick here. I make frequent stops for my chai tea latte's. As usual Starbucks can get quite busy in the morning hours as everyone is going to work. This is a high-traffic intersection so expect there to be people in line. ...  ... if you plan to stop by in the morning on your way to work be sure to leave a few minutes earlier so you can get your fix!  ...  ... I have been here in the afternoons and it is generally pretty clean inside. There are a couple of seats outside but it's right on the corner so you will have a lot of traffic noise. Free Wi-Fi

REVIEW #6:  4 stars  (653 chars)
When I first started visiting this Starbucks, my morning Yelp checkin tips were complaints about slowness. But not anymore. I have NO major complaints about this location. In fact the DI and Eastern location runs circles around the one at Flamingo and Eastern. I get consistent service with a smile, my drinks are made correctly, and my order is for the most part accurate 99% of the time. Once in a while they are out of stuff like brown sugar for their "not-so-perfect" oatmeal, but beyond that this location just consistently kicks it.  ...  ... 4 Strong Stars. There's nothing like caffeine handed to you with a smile to start the morning off right.

REVIEW #7:  3 stars  (901 chars)
*Looks around a corner, Starbucks Appears* ...  ... !!! ...  ... *Looks around another corner, another Starbucks Appears* ...  ... !!!!! ...  ... So many Starbucks', so little time to review each and every single Starbucks that I come across.  This is what you expect, good service, nice feel, and overpriced drinks.  No More, No less.  ...  ... But what the hell is up with the parking situation?  It's about 600 square feet on a corner to fit 2 dozen cars while exiting out on two different streets and a path that leads to the drive-thru. ...  ... That is almost a legit reason NOT to come here, I feel a possible insurance rate increase is not worth the $4.75 double chocolate chip Frappichino.  ...  ... But it's a Starbucks, I can't really hate them outside of their sheetty parking. ...  ... #DemolitionDerbyParkingLot ... #ImGonnaPutOnHipsterGlassesAndWriteArticlesOnMyLaptop ... #TryingToHard

I usually make my own coffee every morning.  Because "Coffee is too expensive."  But this morning I was in a bit of a hurry and I made a quick stop here, at Starbucks.  I am not big on specialty drinks so I just ordered a regular drip.  It was exactly what I expected, friendly and quick service and I was gone.   ...  ... So, no complaints... but no expectations.

REVIEW #9:  3 stars  (408 chars)
It was a grey, rainy and very windy morning in Las Vegas which is unusual. I needed a latte before heading to the NAB convention at LVCC and I stopped here. I don't know if it's the weather but there was a very long line a the drive-in window but no one waiting inside. Because of that, my latte was served in no time and I was on my way. There are a few tables and free wifi if you care to stay longer here.

REVIEW #10:  3 stars  (398 chars)
This is a Starbucks. It doesn't need a review, and I wish Yelp would quit harassing me to review it just because I check in here a lot! ...  ... It's pretty hard to fuck up a coffee, and if they do, they replace it right away. :P ...  ... The parking here can be a bit of a nightmare, though, since it's on the north side of Desert Inn and the east side of Eastern. Very hard to maneuver sometimes.

REVIEW #11:  2 stars  (479 chars)
I travel to other Starbucks locations whenever possible even though this one is closest to my It is okay but there locations that have firendlier staff and just look cleaner. They were willing to brew bold which some other locations won't do after 12 noon. There are times when they would not brew a tank but would offer a pour over which I don't want as much as I don't want Pike Place. I will drink McDonald's coffee before I drink Pike Place. Parking is hard at this location.

I love this Starbucks!  It's like being a contestant on a game show every time you order something!  Go thru the drive thru and you'll experience how fun it is!  My favorite woman is the one with wild blonde hard and sparkly eye shadow.  She's a riot!  The other employees are super friendly here too.  If you're in the neighborhood, this is the best Starbucks location.

After the Great Santa Run, I needed a quick fix of caffeine.  I was on my way downtown to see a play at Theatre7, so this was a good stop.  The staff was pleasant albeit not quite with it.  After charging me for the gingerbread loaf I wanted, they discovered they were out of it.  Asking for a refund on my Starbucks card seemed out of the question, so I got a replacement. ...  ... The drink was good and I was on my way after checking some email and FB posts.

REVIEW #4:  3 stars  (1191 chars)
When a Starbucks is run right it's a thing of beauty for those of us who suffer from chronic caffeine deficiency. But when it's not it can get ugly. And this Starbucks is ugly at 7 am when the staff wouldn't know how to hurry even if you took a cattle prod to them to get them moving. They also have an annoying tendency to mess up orders. And I don't mind service with a smile when the smile is directed towards customers and I understand the need to have a light and fun work place environment. But when you have a line almost out the door, that's not the time to turn this into the local Starbucks employee social hour. I have a limited amount of time to get in, get what I need and get out. I can handle equipment problems and minor delays, but it does not take 7 minutes to get my order done. The Starbucks at DI and Eastern kicks this location's butt on speed and order accuracy.  ...  ... In short, if you're heading West on Flamingo or North on Eastern and need your fix it works. Unless you're in a hurry. And then you might as well forget about it.  ...  ... 3 Stars: Because even though the service has issues, it still takes care of those caffeine withdrawal issues quite nicely.

REVIEW #5:  2 stars  (362 chars)
I love Starbucks but these place is something else. They have way too many workers doing god knows what. The cashier doesn't look up or smile when taking your order. I always order the same drink cinnamon dolce but it taste funny when I order it twice here. I would not waste my time coming to this place keep driving go to the Starbucks on Flamingo and sandhill

REVIEW #6:  1 stars  (1941 chars)
Hello, Starbucks Corporate? I've got a complaint, several in fact.  ... How hard is it to make oatmeal? And how hard is it to keep track of your inventory? Surely your company can hire people who are capable of counting boxes, fruit cups, sugar packets and the like and can tap on a keyboard and place an order for things when supplies run low. Is it asking too much to have your employees to do that? I'm starting to wonder as one of the slowest drive-thrus your company operates at Flamingo and Eastern in Las Vegas can't seem to figure out how to make oatmeal, and to have the toppings needed for it. I ended up driving away without it this morning because of your Chatty Cathy social butterfly at the window getting me distracted by trying to hijack my Starbucks Card. When I called the store to say something about this I got attitude and basically a F'off, we can't help you comment back. And I was told no refunds for my Starbucks Card even though I didn't get my order unless I came back into the store. Uh, that's not how things get done and that won't fly.  ...  ... My expectations are simple. Prompt service. I like fast but I'll lower my expectations to a drive thru wait of under 5 min if there are only 3 cars (trying to be reasonable here). If it's on the menu have it in stock, or tell me up front as I'm ordering that you're out and offer me an alternative. If my order gets messed up apologize and make it right. I don't want to be a grumpy Yelp reviewer, I want to be a happy and loyal Starbucks customer. And one last thing, quit trying to take my super cool retro style Starbucks card. No you can't have it even though it's pretty rare. I have a habit of losing things but I've had my card for many, many years and I don't wanna part with it.  ...  ... 1 Star? Really? Yes, really. I'm hungry. And being hungry due to someone else not doing their basic job duties trumps being nice and diplomatic when writing a review.

REVIEW #7:  1 stars  (768 chars)
I go to Starbucks everyday & am a gold card member & I would definantly drive to another Starbucks than go to this location even though it is right by my mom's house. I am from California & when i viisit this location to get my latte, they ALWAYS mess it up, even after I had to repeat my order 1, 2, 3 times!!! The last time i purchased here was Saturday & the next time I am in Vegas, I will NOT go to this location! By the way, after messing up my drink 3 times the guy at the window didn't appologize & my drink was spilling over & he was VERY RUDE! I wish i got his name but I really wanted to get the heck out of there! He had dark hair & wore glasses!  The staff SUCKS! I never complain on yelp, but this location deserves it by their horrible customer service!

REVIEW #8:  1 stars  (777 chars)
This Starbucks sucks. Let me repeat, this Starbucks sucks. I had a bad experience the whole time that I was there. The barista who was at the register didn't look up or acknowledge me when I went up to her. After awhile, she just gave a rude, "What do you want?" and then turned around to laugh with her coworkers. I had to repeat myself. I ordered my drink and asked for a bagel with cream cheese. It took this woman a whole minute to find where the bagels were placed in their display case. She took my payment, put my bagged bagel on the counter and walked away without saying another word. My drink was made wrong, but I was already tired of dealing with them so I just left. I wish I didn't even have to give them a star, but I guess it is alright since my bagel was good.

REVIEW #9:  1 stars  (813 chars)
Yet again I get more morning craziness at this Starbucks. It's been a week since I was told they were out of some of their oatmeal toppings and that they would order some in. And in that week's time this Starbucks can't seem to get things done. I can get a package from a friend in Kiev, Ukraine sent halfway around the world in 4 days yet Starbucks can't seem to get basic inventory from a warehouse that's less than 500 miles away, if not less in an entire WEEK! I don't get it. So I said so this morning when placing my order. When I get to the main window to pay, the cash register mysteriously went on the fritz, and my entire order got comped. While I love free coffee and breakfast, what I really want is the items I requested.  ...  ... Still 1 Star. I can't reward bad inventory control with extra stars.

REVIEW #10:  1 stars  (1521 chars)
You can't make stuff like this up so let's lead off with today's events. Yesterday I went to this Starbucks and I didn't get my "Perfect Oatmeal" that I ordered. I got a hassle and attitude when I called them about it, so this morning I roll through the drive-thru and tell the lady what happened. She agrees to comp my oatmeal and I add a piece of pumpkin bread to my typical drink order. I pull forward and pay...I had to reload my Starbucks card too so during all this I get my oatmeal and my bread. Then I get my card back and the Southern Belle lady (if you go here you'll know) working the window is like have a nice day. I sit there and she looks back out and is like, What? Why are you still here? I'm like aren't you forgetting something? She looks around and says Oh Crap! when she realizes she never gave me my drink! ...  ... So when I write on here that anyone who visits this Starbucks needs to doublecheck their order to make sure you get what you paid for, will you believe me now? ...  ... 1 Star? Really? Absolutely. Can you think of a reason why I should bump them up? Oh and it took 7 minutes to get that container of oatmeal, a piece of pumpkin bread, and an iced mocha, no whip, extra shot. The location at Eastern and Desert Inn can do it in 4 minutes, with 3 cars in front of me when I order to boot. ...  ... One last thing. Still no fruit toppings for the oatmeal. I guess re-supplying the store is not all that important here.  ...  ... (For the backstory on this read yesterday's review below)

I love this Starbucks location! They have the best customer service and teamwork. When I went in this morning, I was helped out by many different people including the manager. He said he wanted to make sure I wasn't being neglected. I was FAR from being neglected. I was greeted by everyone, asked if I needed help picking something out by one guy, put my order in with another guy, paid a third guy, then checked up on by the manager at the end. I was actually pretty blown away by the service. Surprisingly, there were also a lot of tables and seats available to sit at. I was able to snag a spot in the corner next to an outlet to plug my laptop into. I will be coming back here more often!

Their drive-thru service is totally awesome. Even if there's a line of car, they're efficient enough for the wait to be reasonable every time I go. My order is made correctly, they always make a suggestive sell, like those damn delicious coffee cakes I can't resist. And most importantly, every employee I've encountered has been friendly and personable. ...  ... I love this location. 5 stars for sure!

After discovering that the Border's across the highway got rid of their cafe, I stumbled upon this Starbuck's. As a first-time customer, I am impressed. The staff is friendly. There is plenty of indoor and outdoor seating. And there is a diversity of patrons. ...  Overall this cafe provides a great Starbuck's experience.

REVIEW #10:  4 stars  (248 chars)
Fast service and consistent Starbucks taste but the exterior needs some work and not too pleased with some of the people who hang out in the parking lot so best to go in, get your drink, and leave.  Not a location I'd spend any time hanging out at.

REVIEW #11:  4 stars  (470 chars)
One of the better locations around town, this one has a drive thru and a patio! While the patio is nothing major as it looks out over the parking lot (typical Las Vegas views), it does provide a nice option to enjoy the nice weather that graces us for a total of three months out of the year. ...  ... They're very speedy here, and customer service has always been top notch! The employees are patient and take their time with you, and the drinks are fabulous as always.

The Coffee was hot and the  Breakfast Cake was good and moist.  The place were packed with people.  I will go back.

REVIEW #13:  4 stars  (276 chars)
The drive-thru here is super quick and I would recommend it over going inside. For most other Starbucks locations it is the direct opposite, but for some reason the drive-thru is never too crowded here. Most people seem to go inside to order and then sit on the patio outside.

REVIEW #14:  4 stars  (667 chars)
This is my new go-to Starbucks location. ...  ... Their drive-thru is usually lightening fast and my order is always correct! ...  ... The barista's working the window like to chit-chat with you if your drink is still being made.  The only down side- I'm here everyday (Monday-Friday) and the one guy asks me the same question every time he's working "going to work?"  Some of the other locations recognize you and know your drinks.  This dude doesn't pay attention, obviously, otherwise he would know, yes- I'm going to work. ...  ... Overall, the everyone is really nice and I always enjoy my grande, iced, caramel macchiato with extra caramel on my way to work. :)

REVIEW #15:  3 stars  (1489 chars)
Although I prefer meat and potatoes, I don't much prefer foo foo sweet coffee drinks.  Don't get me wrong, I will drink it when my lady buys say...a seasonal peppermint frappe or mocha with cream...might be making some of these up which goes to show my lack of knowledge on the sweet coffee variety. ...  ... I am a simple man, same order all the time, more or less... Tall Pike's, top it off with no room for cream or sugar please.  That's my thing yo!  Occasionally, I will mess with the bold of the day or some of the seasonal flavors, but ultimately, I do not stray too far from the coffee black pack.  Call me old fashioned, but there is something about the natural flavors from coffee from different regions and so forth.   ...  ... I would love to see Starbucks offer a Hawaiian Kona Coffee and surprised they haven't done so already.  But oh well.   ...  ... The breakfast sandwiches are not all that bad also.  I like the artisan sandwiches, lemon loaf, old fashioned donut or a napple.  The environment is always pleasant as well.  Don't tell Starbucks, but if I am out and looking for a rest room, the first place I look for is a Starbucks, only cause I can bank on it being clean and a dime a dozen when out and about.  ...  ... Wasn't too pleased with the up in price at the beginning of the year, but fluctuation is expected.  hard to go wrong with Starbucks.  Oh yeah, did I mention my man Magic Johnson has his share of business with s-bucks too...not that it matters. LOL.

I just came in to order an iced green tea, which was great.. but the facility looked like it had been drug through the bush backwards.

This Starbucks is pretty disorganized.  Every time I've been in this place I wait much much longer in line than I would've if I would've gone through the drive thru.  So frustrating.  This Starbucks needs some management and better cleaners.

REVIEW #21:  1 stars  (1251 chars)
I used to work for a training store for Starbucks so I know that the company does know how to make delicious drinks.  ...  ... But this Barista needs a lesson how to make a real latte.  ...  ... All she did was pull the shots of espresso directly into the cup, stuck the steam wand into the milk pitcher and just let it sit there! Then poured the heated up milk over the espresso which had been sitting there now "dead" and proceeded to put the lid on and handed it out. YUCK!  ...  ... After watching the barista make it incorrectly I immediately said I need this remade with foam and no don't just froth some foam and top my drink off. Lattes need to be made with care. Froth the milk and dont let it sit because the foam separates from the milk. In order to have a creamy delicious latte pour right after frothing no need for a spoon to scoop up foam! Not that hard people.  ...  ... That was just my boyfriends drink, mine was super simple. Iced grande vanilla latte. Vanilla, espresso, milk then ice. Easy right? Well apparently not since the barista couldn't even put the proper amount of milk in my cup which left me with a half inch of empty space in my cup. Hmm $4.05 for a non full cup, time to move on and buy my own espresso/steam machine!

It was literally a fast interaction.  Working downtown one day, a couple of us needed a cup of joe to help us wake.  I, just needed a refresher.   ...  ... This location is in some big government building on 4th and Bridger downtown.  Right up the steps, you'll find a very busy location!  Government officials, hipsters, tourists, everyone is there.  When we arrived, there was a long line and I thought, gosh, I'm never going to get my drink.  I was proved wrong very quickly.  The staff is efficient, personable and on point!   ...  ... I ordered a venti Very Berry Hibiscus refresher and the reduced-fat Turkey Bacon & White Cheddar Breakfast Sandwich for around $7.50 including tip.  The sandwich was awesome.  Although premade, they did an amazing job heating it up upon order.  The dish is literally a turkey, egg and cheddar sandwich on multigrain English muffin but the 320g of calories says it's worth eating!  The refresher is one of my favorite summer drinks!  It's filled with blackberry and hibiscus extract, sweetened.  The huge whole blackberries brings a great texture to the drink.  As cliche as it sounds, it really is super refreshing! ...  ... I work one block away from this location.  FOR SURE, I will be back!  If you decide to go, maybe I'll see you there!

This is my place for a pick me up after spending time at the RJC (courthouse).  The staff are super friendly.  The orders are processed fast.  It is in the Bank of America building that also hold Social Security Office of Disability Adjudication and Review (ODAR).  It is a prime location and the staff still work it.  Even in the afternoon, they have goodies if you have not had a chance to eat and were working too hard.  There is not a lot of setting here, but I rarely stay.  I am usually walking in and back out to my office with my coffee and/or snack.

This Starbucks location is downtown near the court house on Lewis St. With that being said many people may automatically assume that his location is a dump. Its actually not! Great baristas who are jolly and excited to get you up and running with your Starbucks fix. It's definitely smaller than normal Starbucks locations but thay because its located on the main floor of the corporate Bank of America building. Very clean environment, still offers wi-fi, could have more space for customers.

REVIEW #6:  3 stars  (582 chars)
A lot of Starbucks reviews this week.  I must be tired.  This is my other Starbucks and the closest one to the courthouses, federal or state.  It's inside the Bank of America building on the first floor.  The Starbucks can only validate before 10am and only for 20 minutes so it's better just to park elsewhere. ...  ... The line gets crazy long at this Starbucks and there isn't much room by the pick up counter so I hope you aren't claustrophobic!  The staff here is nice, although not as nice as my neighborhood location, and they do make the hot English muffin sandwiches.  Yay!

Sure you come to Starbucks for the coffee. That's the excuse you use to come here, but for me it's only half the reason I enjoy it. The other half is to grab a seat and crush some work, read a paper or just clickity clack on the phone in a chill atmosphere. That part of the 'bucks is completely lost here. Stuffed in an office building lobby, this is more of a walk-thru Starbucks than anything. A few tables and a bathroom is all there is here. Waiting for your coffee is a bit of a pain as well, as there isn't a ton of room to stand around. The coffee is standard 'bucks, so if you need your fix stop by, just don't plan on staying for a while.

This Starbuck's is in downtown Las Vegas, in the first floor of a hi-rise building. Sometimes it is hard to find street parking, so if you go into the building's parking lot and come out in a hurry, like 10 minutes, they won't charge you.  ...  ... Inside is nice, like you would expect in a hi-rise building, with  most of the customers working in the building or running errands to and from the building. This is not that far from the County Courthouse, which is a huge architectural behemoth across the street a few blocks. ...  ... And if you go in the early morning, there is usually a line winding out of the corner down the street at 330 4th street, where the Mexican Consulate is located, and people are waiting to get paperwork from there as soon as it opens.

REVIEW #10:  2 stars  (714 chars)
I am not a real big fan of fast-food type coffee houses. I think they are overpriced and I prefer the taste of my coffee at home. Nonetheless, there are times when you are out and you need caffeine fix and all there is is Starbucks.  ...  ... I always order a latte. It is the simplest, cheapest option besides regular coffee, which for me always tastes kind burnt. When I was younger, and did not care about calorie count, I would order the mocha Frappuccino. Alas, I prefer to eat my calories.  ...  ... This location has been renovated, and it is much nicer and airier that before. They also have a nice patio outside for people watching (and to laugh at people going the wrong way, 4th street is one way guys).

REVIEW #11:  2 stars  (546 chars)
Oh dear. Listen ladies, I know that working at Starbucks isn't the greatest job in the world but at the very least represent your brand appropriately. Telling me you "don't have" 1% milk and then getting snarky with me when I suggest mixing nonfat and 2% is no way to treat a paying guest. I have been in your barista-shoes before and I don't appreciate your piss poor interpretation of service. I'm exhausted and in the middle of working a double-back shift right now so, the next time I order a latte, you can hold the side of attitude. Thanks.

REVIEW #2:  4 stars  (252 chars)
Coffee in the morning.  ...  ... Ideal spot after a hang over.  ...  ... Delicious veggie panini with Monterey cheese.  ...  ... Elegantly looking coffee place.  ...  ... Menu was at the big flat screen wall-mounted TVs.  ...  ... Staff needs to smile.

REVIEW #3:  3 stars  (919 chars)
Small Starbucks location located right inside the convention center. Good in a pinch if you really really really must get in your caffeine fix. Usually there are long ass lines here that will suck the life out of you, especially in the morning and worse during large attendance trade shows. Late in the day it's not that bad though but it closes at 5pm. ...  ... Very limited menu here for coffee drinks and pastries. I guess to keep it simple with all the crowds. There is also no seating inside except for a few counter stools, but there are a few tables and chairs in the lobby outside the place. Be prepared to fight for one, or do the hover until someone leaves. ...  ... I have to hand it to the counter staff here as they are pretty friendly and even keeled. It can get really obnoxious with the non-stop long lines and grumpy people. ...  ... One bad thing here is that they do not accept Starbucks cards. Fail!

REVIEW #4:  3 stars  (947 chars)
This Starbucks is in the convention center in Vegas. And they have you all to themselves as there is no one else that you can go to. So, they have a very limited menu of drinks, because the wait times during a conference can take 15-20 minutes just to get to the front of the line to place your order. I understand why they have a limited menu, it allows them to push the coffee out the door as quickly as possible. However when you were born in the coffee capital and have experience a great coffee shop before, you will see the glaring miss in a full compliment establishment. ...  ... The staff was very efficient, again due to the smaller menu size, however the baked goods left something to be desired. They were mostly out of everything by the time I got to the front of the line and that was at 9AM. The line was 30 deep past me and growing. Better planning should have taken place knowing a huge conference was going to be in the building.

REVIEW #5:  3 stars  (769 chars)
This Starbucks is located in South Lower Hall - next to FedEx Office. Basically, if you need Starbucks, it's here.  ...  ... When ordering coffee - keep it very, very simple. Don't expect the staff here to be of the regular Starbucks, such as based in Seattle proper. They've made mistakes in my orders, because it's too complicated to process, such as missing additional shots of espresso, or missing secondary options to drinks for my crew.  ...  ... So, when I order coffee here, I usually just order the most simplistic request, such as "Soy Latte" and keep it like that. Though, one time I did order a drink, and they gave me regular milk. There goes my stomach. :-/ ...  ... Also, their hours are not consistent and can vary based upon expected tradeshow traffic.

REVIEW #6:  3 stars  (493 chars)
Yes - another starbucks ! ...  ... This one is located in the convention, and thank god for that! When days at tradeshows here start early, I need my coffee to keep me going. ...  ... Lines are always long due to the overwhelming amount of people - you can expect a good 15 minute wait. ...  ... Their menu is limited since they have to serve so many people.  ...  ... I am glad they are there and have what I like in the morning - white mocha a venti non fat, no whip, extra hot, white mocha!

REVIEW #7:  3 stars  (412 chars)
You're stuck in a convention and need your coffee, latte fix. This is the only spot unless you can drink black brewed with creme that tastes burnt form the vendors inside the hall. Basically, this is the only option. There's an incredibly long line that moves - just barely, but at least it moves.  ...  ... For a Starbucks, it's slightly below average. The redeeming quality - it's the only caffeine fix around.

REVIEW #8:  2 stars  (212 chars)
I only stop here when I have to. No drive thru. It is usually packed with all the taxi drivers from the strip. They often mess up your order, and it seems like you either wait too long in line, or for your drink.

REVIEW #9:  2 stars  (213 chars)
Just your average Starbucks.  Nothing special.  The breakfast sandwiches are so hot and burn my mouth on every occassion.  I have told the sales people but they say they have to cook them at a certain temperature.

REVIEW #10:  2 stars  (334 chars)
You don't come here unless you have no alternatives... and not much alternatives is the situation you get into when you come to large conventions at the LVCC. Figure it will take you about half an hour to get your fix so it's better to come here with friends and chat in line or better yet a friend willing to get your coffee for you!

I have always been a big fan of Starbucks. We're talking about years! Love this location that's just minutes from my house. The main thing I like about it is it is very cozy, intimate and never too slammed. Although I haven't yet, I can see a few Sundays in here just hanging out, drinking my Skinny Vanilla Latte (until the fall flavors come. Mmmmm.....Egg Nog and Pumpkin Spice Latte!!!) while surfing the net on my iPad or Macbook. The employees here are super cool as well. Always nice....always! And lastly, the aroma once you walk into the door is just hypnotizing! Yup....I'm an addict!

REVIEW #5:  4 stars  (249 chars)
This is a normal Starbuck's outlet.  It does not have a drive through which makes it somewhat quaint. The pace is a bit laid back because you have to park and actually walk inside. ...  ... I have always found the staff to be pleasant and efficient.

REVIEW #6:  4 stars  (849 chars)
This is my favorite Starbucks location in North Las Vegas/Las Vegas/Henderson (and I want to say that I have been to 90% of them.  Yes, I have an addition!) ...  ... When I walk into this location, the staff knows my drink.  Ben, is probably the best "barista" that I have ever seen!  He is FAST and makes the best drinks.  The rest of the staff are really nice too.  But Ben has got to be my favorite. ...  ... I am giving it 4 stars because this location does not have a drive-thru, which would be fantastic.  And a couple of the staff like to talk to my ear off BEFORE they give me my coffee. (don't most people know that people don't like to have deep conversations before coffee or caffeine? haha!)  Luckily, I see those staff members maybe every two weeks. ...  ... Thank you, Ben, for being a hard-worker and giving fabulous customer service!

REVIEW #7:  4 stars  (1113 chars)
Yelp is real reviews by real people. This real person is a fan of coffee. When it is hot! A slight dilemma at this Starbucks was that the coffee was not hot. After they brewed new coffee, it still wasn't hot. By the time of the refill the coffee was hot.  ...  ...   Despite the fact that the first two cups of coffee were not hot, this is a charming Starbucks. It is in a part of Las Vegas that isn't hyper busy. Because the shopping center it anchors is small it is not challenging to find a parking space. Without a drive thru and featuring soft lighting, this is a cozy Starbucks. It looks like it was remodeled with an emphases on comfort. The baristas are personable and fast. An example of friendly service is when the barista let a customer use their phone. ...  ...    A closing time of 7 p.m., seems kind of early on a Saturday. But it makes business sense considering this Starbucks does most of its business in the morning (this is what the barista told the customer). ...  ...   This real person could return to this Starbucks if he is in the area. Most likely it will be for an ice blended beverage.

REVIEW #8:  4 stars  (446 chars)
You know what to expect at Starbucks, so not many surprises. No drive thru - don't care. They don't seem to keep the place quite as clean as my local Starbucks and pastries are in shorter supply than other Starbucks the afternoon I was there.  ...  ... i always feel a little inadequate in Starbucks because I don't order a stupidly complicated drink, but it's an extremely safe option for coffee, always consistent, cool vibe and New York Times.

REVIEW #9:  3 stars  (325 chars)
I like this Starbucks. The staff is very friendly and it has a welcoming feel to the shop. I think not having a drive up window is a blessing.  ... I would give this shop a 5 star if they were ever open when I want them to be. They close at 6, and I'm always looking for a coffee after dinner, or on my way out for the night.

REVIEW #10:  3 stars  (823 chars)
I use several Starbucks to hold quick business meetings. Of course I always order coffee.  However, I generally purchase Starbuck's beans at the supermarket.  Many people do not know that if you bring the bag into Starbucks they give you a FREE tall coffee.  I have atleast 20 of these bags sitting in my car.  Well, I decided to use two of these on the same day at this location (I had two meetings), well the Cashier (who looked like a manager) gave me this furrowed brow look speaking "Really, cheapo?"   and when  she gave me my coffee she said "here".   Where was the Thank you? ...  ... As she wants, I probably won't be coming here anymore.  Besides, the inside doesn't have much table seating, the music is too loud, and the parking lot is a nightmare due to some very popular restaurants along with this Starbucks.

REVIEW #11:  3 stars  (562 chars)
I'm not a huge fan of Starbucks, never have been. But I was given a giftcard and that's fine. I do have 1 or 2 drinks from there that I like.  I typically enjoy their iced green tea latte with soy milk.  Their prices are typical for a coffee shop. (I personally believe they are a little over priced but they are in comparible to other places)  Service is good and typically not a problem on their rare times that I go.  They definitely need to expand their food products and lower their prices on them.  A muffin to go with a coffee should never be more then $2

REVIEW #12:  3 stars  (252 chars)
Pretty typical Starbucks.  While I'm a fan of the company, the one thing about this place is that the parking in the morning is kind of meh and there's no drive-thru.  The couple times I've gone to this one, the service has been quick so that was good.

REVIEW #13:  3 stars  (210 chars)
This location is ok. The level of service and overall attentiveness to the guest could be dramatically improved. The drink was made properly. The vibe in this store was very low as if they didnt want customers.

REVIEW #14:  1 stars  (402 chars)
Well this rating is going down. This location is always out of breakfast sandwiches. Like they had the classic sausage and cheddar sandwich literally once the last ten times I tried to buy it. ... The frustrating part is that I drive less than a mike to the much busier location next to LVAC and they have have never been out.  ... So whoever is doing your ordering. You are losing sales and customers.

I go to Starbucks every day.  This was my first time at this new location on East Flamingo in the Howard Hughes Center. ...  ... The shop is roomy, it has lots of product (juices, pastries, and sandwiches--typical Starbucks stuff.  The wifi is free and it's fast--faster since Starbucks converted from AT&T to Google for their wifi.  There are two areas to sit outside.  There are some tables along the front and there's a patio on the east side.  Since the building is quite tall, it gives you shade in the afternoon. ...  ... There are plenty of chairs and one long table with stools where you can work with a laptop or just use your smartphone.  It's far enough away from UNLV that students won't walk here to hang, study, and otherwise be their normal pains in the butt as they are across Maryland Parkway from that Bucky.  This will just be a place where the adults come to use Bucky's wifi so they can conduct their businesses from their "office." ...  ... The staff was on the ball today and it was a good stop.  I'll be back again now that I know the store is open.

REVIEW #4:  5 stars  (457 chars)
This is my favorite Starbucks.   It is a standalone building and it is quite modern.  Yes, the drive thru can be a bit hectic but that is because of its prime location, right off Flamingo.  That is not only great for the Starbucks believers but for the business itself.   Sharon typically works during the AM hours and it is amazing how one person along with a great cup of 'whatever you order' can enhance your day.  She is always pleasant and so friendly.

REVIEW #5:  4 stars  (910 chars)
Busy place every time I've gone. So many offerings and combinations , it must drive the staff bonkers. They are about as friendly and efficient as they can be though. ... I have to order a "clover made" coffee now that SBUX only offers blends, which I don't like at all. Makes me spend more which I don't like either. ... I do like the clover coffees, but I don't like the thought that in order for ME to get what I like, I cannot simply order the regularly brewed coffee ( since it's always blended with coffees I dislike).  ... I've been to several SBUX in LV, and this IMHO, had the most outside seats, friendliest staff, and best choices.  ... Of all the chain stores in the world , ... SBUX is the only one I consistently ... seek out. However, their switch to "blended coffees"  as well as the consistently weak WiFi (I usually switch to my carrier's LTE) is causing me to re-evaluate my loyalty to SBUX.

REVIEW #6:  4 stars  (417 chars)
Only 4 weeks old and a brand new building including a drive through. This is one of the largest Starbucks I've visited. What a difference compared to the original location in Seattle which opened in 1971 ...  ... The driveways from Howard Hughes weren't paved yet it's so new. The service was solid and selection of coffee and brew paraphernalia was impressive.  ...  ... This will be a regular stop when I'm in town!

REVIEW #7:  4 stars  (1733 chars)
Re-locating from the location at 395 Hughes Center Drive where Starbucks hold the memories to remember and recall.  My favorite Starbucks Coffee Shop that just melts me like butter on pancakes, like whipped cream over hot chocolate is now in a newer, bigger location transferring from 395 Hughes Center Dr. to this location by the corner of Hughes Center Parkway, on E. Flamingo Road. So it is a welcoming place as it is a stand-alone building that's newly-built. Wide, panoramic windows lets in the light for a brighter feel with roadside views. Oh, to just people-watch or rather vehicles-passing-by-watch for the watcher in you! As expected, the effervescence of hot brewed coffee permeates the air and lingers to my nostrils' delight! Jazz music adds to the vibe, allowing my senses to relax and imbibe on a beverage of my choice. Take a pick from nice brewed green hot tea, decaffeinated coffee, cool iced tea, delicious coffee, and  various beverages. Choices of baked goods from bagels, to cakes as well as sandwiches and an assortment of desserts, bagels, chips, nuts, meal wraps, dried fruit to whet your appetite. Imbibe, linger, socialize over delicious beverages indoors or outdoors on its small patio under green umbrellas for delighting in the fresh air. Also a breeze of a gain from getting feet off the ground just to obtain the beverage while on-the-run via its Drive-Thru service. Starbucks looks like a little castle surrounded by spaceousness. Ample parking surrounds the new contemporary building. Coffee Hours are from Mondays - Sundays at 4:30 AM - 12:00 AM...that's great hours for the owls and early risers. Coffee servers are ever attentive and happy to serve. Sip your favorite beverages or Coffee, anyone?

REVIEW #8:  4 stars  (594 chars)
Seems this particular SBUX thrives on a crowd. The bigger the crowd, the more efficient the staff becomes. Gotta love that! I was maybe 15th in line- but it moved surprisingly quickly. The outside table clean-up is, at best, meh.  ... You get yer caffeine buzz AND yer crowd buzz at this joint. ... However, if you order an espresso, and ur eligible for a free re, you gotta get one of their blended coffees- no free re on anything else. To me, their blended coffees are ehh, no good. If you like ur coffee foo-foo'd up, mbe they're alright. I like mine like I like the night-black. No foo-foo.

REVIEW #9:  4 stars  (396 chars)
The baristas w/o the Jeremy Piven headsets are the most customer service oriented. (IMHO). I guess the headsets are an attempt to be efficient, hip, and techie. But plain ole customer service is dipping slightly. I guess SBUX, once the Pike Place Market of the world, is trying to be the Tiffany/Prada of the world.  ... Still, when I travel, I seek out the chain because it is fairly consistent.

REVIEW #10:  3 stars  (338 chars)
I think this location is pretty uncomfortable inside. Lots of army style metal chairs, and only 3 armless upholstered chairs clustered around a small table. Also, the new "boulangerie" pastries are tiny and unappetizing in appearance. The good news for old timer Starbucks customers like myself, is that I can still get a good cappuccino.

I second the opinion of best Starbucks in town.  Drinks are always great, service is fantastic (Sharon is the best) and they always remember people's drinks.  Gets busy between 8:30 and 9:30 am because it's right next to the Howard Hughes offices but they always handle it well.  Love this place.

The amount of money that I have spent here over the past couple years is probably equivalent to a down payment of a new house. Addict? Yes!!  This location is always my first stop on the way to a busy day on campus. The baristas are always smiling, very courteous and remember my drink every single time I am in. They always make it strong just the way I like it. Now if only they would establish a frequent buyer program this world would be a better place for all of us coffee hounds.

This location is legendary in Las Vegas. Now closes at midnight but used to be the spot when open 24 hours. Attached to the FedEx Office so makes a great office away from the office. I used to get a lot of work done there. Spot where I've seen many celebrities if that is your thing. Crew very professional. At least two of the team members I have seen there for about 10 years. Attitudes are still great at this location and you can get bold drip day and night. A g0od amount of seating inside and outdoor patio too. Great people watching location due to many office buildings, high rise condos and Stirp visitors

REVIEW #4:  4 stars  (1343 chars)
Located just northwest  of the Paradise at Flamingo Road intersection in the southeast  corner of the Howard Hugh's Business Park on Paradise Road I have usually seen this Starbucks busy. A good amount of the business are people  staying at the Paradise Road hotels, working in the Howard Hugh's Business Park and local establishments, UNLV students, and locals like myself. ...    In my opinion, the drawback to this Starbucks  is the heavy traffic on the two connecting  roads: Paradise and Flamingo Roads. First off it is illegal for northbound Paradise Road motorists  to make a left turn from the parking lot. This  requires driving into the business park to get to the traffic signal. Second, waiting to make a right turn onto southbound Paradise Road from the parking lot before  sitting through a few relight cycles during peak traffic has made me more steamed than my coffee. ...    Regardless of getting in and out of this Starbuck's, I regard this as a good  Starbuck's. It is currently open from 4:30 to 12:30 AM. What is unique, at least in the Vegas area  is that attached inside to a Fed Ex Office Store. There is sufficient indoor and outdoor seating. And the baristas are friendly. ...  Will I return? Maybe if I am in the area or get an urge to go to this Starbucks.  I Know for sure that I will avoid it during peak traffic.

Nice busy location next to FedEx.  They are fast with preparing drinks.  I was actually offered a sample of the Iced Chai Tea  the last time I came in.  I was shocked.  The sample was quite a nice size too.  Tasty too I might add.  So I did step out of my normal drink and ordered a glass! ...  ... The few times that I have sat inside, the dining area needed cleaning from crumbly table tops to empty cups on the tables and wrappers on the floor.

This one replaced the location on Howard Hughes (inside FedEx). It is very bright from the floor to ceiling windows. The lobby is spacious and there are plenty of tables. This location has a drive thru and features the new Clover coffee brew machine. The Clover is a specialty machine that brews Starbucks reserve and exotic coffees by the cup. The price of the Clover brewed coffee is a little higher but the coffee is of a higher quality.  Although I'll miss the old location on Howard Hughes from YEARS of being a customer, this one is much nicer.

REVIEW #4:  3 stars  (527 chars)
Not sure what other reviewers mean by comfortable seating. Compared to older Starbucks, the seating in here stinks. There are plenty of army type metal chairs and stools, and only three armless, stiff upholstered chairs clustered around a teeny tiny table. Very ultra industrial, with a very, very high ceiling so noise echoes like crazy. Also, the new "boulangerie" pastries are pathetic. Everything is tiny and sad looking. But the good news is, for old timer Starbucks customers like me, I can still get a decent cappuccino.

REVIEW #3:  5 stars  (635 chars)
Starbucks is pretty consistent around the country.  Service was fast, staff friendly, tables and chairs were a little disorganized and dirty compared to the typical Starbucks I visit.  The taste of the coffee was great and they made it exactly as I ordered.  Price is twice as much as I normally pay so it is a bit pricey.  They accept and honor the rewards program but will not accept free drink rewards.  So they will grant you a star for their rewards program and offer the free refills, but will not honor the free drink rewards.  Perhaps that's in the fine print somewhere on Starbucks' rewards agreement.  Overall I am satisfied.

Here in Vegas, not much sleep the night before, and I needed some coffee to wake up and enjoy our day's outing.  Bellagio was not any help at all - the dessert place there wanted $9.50 for a frappuccino-like coffee - a price I refused to pay no matter how zombie-like I was. ...  ... Stumbled next door to Planet Hollywood's Miracle Mile shops, and there was a Starbucks - salvation was mine!  Had their special Salted Caramel Mocha frap; perfectly made (no leftover slush near the bottom), it hit the spot and did the wake up job nicely. ...  ... A comment on pricing.  Another reviewer commented they thought Starbucks' Strip prices were double vs. elsewhere.  Not sure of their point of reference, but I find Strip frap prices about $1 more than the San Francisco area.  Certainly more, but definitely not double for me.  And lower than some other coffee shops on the Strip. ...  ... This Starbucks is on the edge of Planet Hollywood's casino, and is open 24 hours.  Look for it near the casino floor immediately upon entering the Miracle Mile Shops entrance off N Las Vegas Blvd.

Great coffee and service. Unfortunately this locations free wi-fi is a cruel joke as are all the other free Wi-Fi spots within Planet Hollywood.  Either get your wi-fi up and going with enough spectrum to service your few customers or put up a sign notifying the patrons your wi-fi doesn't really work. Doing otherwise is false advertising.

I asked for a couple of paper cups (just cups) and the employee shook his head. No apology, no polite refusal. I responded with a "what? Really?" and he shook his head again. Aghasted, I walked away.  ...  ... I used to work at a Starbucks and I know for sure this is not an issue.

No stars! Horrible I just wanted tap water after my husband bought a $4 coffee. Crystal refused and laughed and said come back with your own cup so I did and they all laughed l. I asked for a manager and she gave me a card that said "princess rippy" (702) 497-9598  horrible horrible

ECLAIR! ...  ... That is all. ...  ... No seriously though. It's the best eclair ever and I always make sure to stop by Rio every Vegas trip to get an eclair from either one of their Starbucks. I think the Rio Starbucks has the BEST pastry case in comparison to any of the other million Starbucks. Everything is always different and super fresh and good!

REVIEW #2:  5 stars  (127 chars)
Ordered 3 coffees. For a Sunday night, the service was great and the girl behind the counter was friendly and helpful! Awesome!

REVIEW #3:  5 stars  (359 chars)
The Rio actually provides fresh pastries to Starbuck in their hotel!! The scones are the best ever. I like how the Rio is smart and has a seperate line when its busy for Pastries and drip coffee only. I have seen late at night that some of the pastires go on sale for a buck each. Also to people who didnt know, there is a huge 2nd SB which is quiet and huge.

REVIEW #5:  4 stars  (275 chars)
Pretty good... Probably the only Starbucks in Rio. Prices are a tad expensive, but then again, it's Vegas. My only complaint would be the limited table space and the lack of free wifi that most Starbucks offer! Other than that, it's just like any other Starbucks you'll find!

This is for the quickserve Starbucks at Flamingo. ...  ... Quick service all 4 mornings I was there, no complaints.  The apple muffin is a must!

REVIEW #7:  4 stars  (828 chars)
This Starbucks is located inside the Rio and actually there are two in the hotel. One by the elevators in the Ipanema Tower and one by the convention hall and spa. I visited both and found the one by the Ipanema towers were always packed but the one by the spa was always quiet and had no line. It's a little bit of a walk but I preferred this location better. Not only was it not busy but it also had a lot more seating and was away from all the chaos of the casinos and a bit less smokey too.  ...  ... Service at both locations I found were great and employees were nice and friendly. Prepare for the higher prices though. Comparable to airport prices but I suppose that's the price you pay for convenience. And since you're ok with paying $15 for mixed drinks in Vegas, I suppose $5.50 for an iced coffee is about right. lol

REVIEW #8:  3 stars  (327 chars)
Every time I passed by this place, there was only 1 person working. She made the coffee, served the pastry, worked the cash register. So there was a long line. But the eclair looked so good, I gave in. Stood in the long line. The server was very nice in spite of being overworked. The eclair was very good; the coffee was good.

REVIEW #9:  3 stars  (366 chars)
it's a prime spot, right next to the elevators. which also makes it a bad spot because everyone comes here. they had 2 lines when we came by for the mornings. 1 for regular drips and 1 for all the shmancy shit. the shmancy shit line took FOREVER! but, at least the baristas were very nice.  ...  ... if you are just looking for coffee, try the sports book cafeteria.

I like Starbucks, I like the big green giant coffee house. My sister in law orders 2 Americana and the lady screws up the order and then said's to her, "You ordered that!" with a attitude ... "Hmmmm" I know customer service and the customer is always right. They also over charged her and owed her money, and she said, "Well i have to call the manager to open the register. " Dang !!! go get manager and get the $. Must be a full moon ???? All i have to say is many Starbucks stay away from this one. Go to a Starbucks that has customer service. No Wifi, small and horrible service. I don't like writing bad reviews but i can't let go through this pain.

REVIEW #1:  5 stars  (911 chars)
City Center on the Vegas Strip is a beautiful example of modern design, almost a Modern Art Museum masquerading as several hotels. So you would expect nothing less that the Crystals Mall Starbucks would reflect this impressive design - and it delivers.  A beautiful, modern-architected Starbucks, near the state-of-the-art Aria Hotel, that will have you constantly looking up and around  to soak in your surroundings. Oh, and by the way - the coffee is great, as usual!  Also, the Crystal Mall website reports: "In addition to the standard Starbucks menu items, this location will carry special items hand prepared by Aria's culinary team every day, all for under $10." What more could you want? ...  ... Entrance to Crystal Mall off S Las Vegas Blvd is the easiest entrance to find this Starbucks.  Just a short walk straight thru mall from that entrance.  It's on the mezzanine level near the Grand Staircase.

REVIEW #2:  1 stars  (1154 chars)
There's honestly no reason for me to review yet another Starbucks, but I think this location earns the distinction of being the most expensive Starbucks location. ...  ... I understand that in this changing market, Starbucks are getting more expensive. I get that. ...  ... Nestled in the Crystals Mall, this Starbucks has some of the most interesting decor. I mean, it is Vegas on the Strip. With a convenient location right in the center of many hotels, I can see why this would be a go-to place to grab a coffee after a long night out. ...  ... Frankly, it's not worth it. ...  ... I ordered two grande drinks, and the cost totaled to over $12. Seriously? I wasn't ordering any fancy frappuccinos with the works or anything like that. I was simply ordering normal hot lattes and stuff, and lo and behold, I'm paying like $6 each for coffee. ...  ... If I wanted expensive coffee, I'd hit up a brand name coffee shop elsewhere. ...  ... There are other Starbucks locations on the Strip, and while I don't know the prices there, I recommend trying those instead. ...  ... They also did not have a scanner for the app. Seriously? ...  ...

It is a brand new location on the Strip, so it is clean, nice and spacious, but SO overpriced! $4.55 for a tall cappuccino - are you kidding me?! And no free refills with the gold card membership - now, that's just sacrilegious.  ...  ... I paid $10.17 for a cup of coffee and a toasted bagel and my fingers just wouldn't let go of my credit card :) I guess this is Vegas, baby!

REVIEW #5:  2 stars  (445 chars)
Most Starbucks are welcoming and friendly.  The manager at this on this am was not.  I asked for a drink with the fixings (2 splenda and 2 shots of cream).  I was rudely told I can do it myself by the manager to the self serve bar.  I have been to various Starbucks and have never been directed to make my iwn drink.  Isn't part of the price the aervice?  Also the membership system was down.  The two stars are for the great decor of the store.

Walked over from the Cosmo to pick up some much needed coffee and breakfast for Hubs and I. ...  ... The staff was very friendly, area was clean and organized and prices were very high.  ...  ... I ordered 1 skinny grande mocha ($5.85) 1 grande pumpkin spice latte ($5.85 with soy milk extra charge of $0.75 added) small fruit bowl ($5.95), oatmeal ($5.) and a yogurt parfait ($5.95) The total was $31.73.  ...  ... The coffees weren't good. My mocha didn't have much flavor and Hubs said his wasn't as good as he has had in the past. The fruit and yogurt were fresh and good. The oatmeal portion was pretty small. When I removed the lid it was less than half full. After 4-5 bites it was gone. The packet that came with it had brown sugar, nuts and raisins.  ...  ... Next time I would pass on this Starbuck's. I will go to Va Bene (at the Cosmo) or to a restaurant for the same amount of money and get a real meal and good coffee.

This is one of the better Starbucks I have been to.  It is large and open.  The decor is clean and more upscale than most.  The staff is friendly. ...  ... The most important positive is the fact there are almost no leaches that have set up shop for the day, to mooch off the internet.  Real patrons can actually sit down and enjoy their coffee.

This Starbucks, located next to Pinkberry and the Mandarin Oriental Hotel on S. Las Vegas Blvd, is a relatively new addition to the CityCenter family of Starbucks. Having opened in March of this year, it sports a beautiful dark wood interior and some fancy display of technology. ...  ... The front entrance is dominated by a large wood plaque naming Starbucks coffee blends offered here, and an oversized Starbucks icon. The combination is visually unique and dramatic, and keeping with CityCenter's artistic flair. ...  ... Seating is varied, with a back collection of comfortable couches, and a front set of stools and counter, a combo perfect for Vegas people watching.  Outside seating on Las Vegas Blvd. is also available. ...  ... Opposite the front stools is an engaging digital display of a tweet feed, #starbucksvegas.  Although a bit repetitive because there's not a high-volume of tweets at this point, we found it fairly addictive to watch while enjoying our coffee. This is the first I've seen of this new Starbucks technology, but I have a feeling it will be coming to more new stores in the future. ...  ... Coffee lovers powerwalking down S Las Vegas Blvd. now have a new option for a quick caffeine fix!

A Starbucks is a Starbucks, right? But this location really stands out from the rest! ...  ... -friendly employees (especially the early morning crew) ... -fast drive thru ... -rarely makes mistakes ... -I don't have to ask for napkins if I order food ... -I don't have to ask for a stopper when I order a hot drink. Either they give me one automatically or THEY ask if I want one. ... -they give out coupons when there are promotions going on.  ...  ... Sometimes I go to other Starbucks in the area, but service is not as good as it is here. I have experienced longer wait times, employees who don't say thank you, and wrong orders. This location is convenient for me because I can stop by before going to work. Also, I believe this is the only Starbucks on Spring Mountain.

I can't believe this Starbucks isn't listed on YELP?!?!! ...

Anyhow, This one is never overly busy has a drive through... ... It isn't the largest Starbucks but for the clientele it gets at varioius times of the day that I've been here over and over again it is just right. ...  ...

I had a gift card I got my my sister so decided to come in one day. Very clean and I have to say out of all the Starbucks I've been to the people working here are extremely nice. Sue recommended a sweetener I should get with my regular green tea frap and it was delish! They welcomed everyone who came in and passed out samples. Excellent customer service.

REVIEW #5:  5 stars  (404 chars)
I have never gone in to this store but always gone through the drive through and i must day they are the quickest drive through i have been to. They can have cars wrapped around their store and still get customers right through. Traffic on the other may cause a little back up, but hey what do you expect its China town. The partners are always friendly whenever i pass through. Awesome location to visit

This is a pretty efficient Starbucks. I often use the drive through and they get me on my way quickly. I'm not a fan that you aren't supposed to U-turn into the parking lot when going South on Valley View.  ... Helpful tip: when driving East on Spring Mountain turn left at Polaris and follow around (2 Rights) it will take you to Valley View and you can turn right into the parking lot. Sometimes I just do the U-turn, don't tell my mom!  ...  ... Staff is always friendly! Today the girl recommended I try vanilla with my Gem Tea Latte. She said since I already use Soy milk that is vanilla flavored it will complement it quite nicely. She was definetly right. It was yummy!  ...  ... I sure wish Starbucks would offer Almond Milk! They need to figure that ish out before I get lured away by another coffee house.

Consistency will always be on Starbucks' side. It is hard to mess up something as simple as an Iced Coffee with no sweetener or milk. Maybe  it is best to keep it as basic as possible. ...  ... The drive thru moves at a quick pace and I can easily get my order in and ready within minutes. If I do not have time to just sit back and enjoy the ambiance than Starbucks is good. If you don't have to be anywhere, go to one of the local own shops and just enjoy the atmosphere.

The selling points for this location are they have a drive thru and they are conveniently located in Chinatown, just off the 15. I pass this location coming from many different locations and it's often a nice little spot to stop when I'm in need of a caffeine fix. I don't frequent Starbucks or any drink spots in town since I'm not much of a caffeine addict, but it's a good spot when the mood strikes.

they have these great lounge chairs, which helped pass 1.5 hours after lunch waiting for our ride. and this is the first place i saw a treinte size. i had an iced coffee so i don't know if they are skilled, but it was done quick and they didn't kick us out.

As someone who once upon a time was employed by Starbucks, frequents Starbucks to the point of owning a Gold Card which is frequently used, and can list off their new products by quarters, I have a pretty solid grasp of the company, their standard, and some of the finer details that the company keeps. ...  ... Service here is generally pretty decent in terms of drink turn around time, well-trained, friendly baristas, and I frankly love the location and appearance of this particular Starbucks: The Pagoda style roof/building is charming.   ...  ... The GM is super cute and friendly, super chatty about the company, and has done some pretty awesome things such as helped me condense and transfer all of my funds around from one gift card, an old Gold Card that would store but not "Read" money, and my new Gold Card and put it all into one card.  Horray! ...  ... Not only that, but the crowd here is fun.  Since it's in China Town, it only stands to reason that you would have a lot of Asians: Chinese, Japanese, Koreans, and even Vietnamese.  So it's a great spot to go and people watch.  (I drive a Honda and parked in the middle of a 7-long row of Honda vehicles in the parking lot, hahahaha.) And an occasional drag queen pops up here, to boot.  Yeah, interesting crowd! ...  ... So anyway, my main issue with this place is the fact that over the last four years that I've been dropping by, the DM or someone has been a little too overzealous with the state of employment in this store.  Every time my co-workers and I get to know a barista at this location, they're GONE!  They've been transferred off, or just "let go" at the drop of a hat, with no warning or notice to us.  As a company that just dreams of becoming a frequent habit in your lifestyle, it's a little offputting for this to happen not just once or twice but ALL the time!  One of the reasons why I love the Starbucks by me at Tenaya/Crag is because the individuals who are up there have been there for some time and haven't been transferred out - I know them, they know my drink preferences, and so on.   ...  ... So yeah, it's a decent Starbucks but don't get too attached to any of the staff, they never seem to be there more than year.  :|

REVIEW #21:  3 stars  (487 chars)
Eh, Starbucks does not have the best coffee in the world, but its every where, on every corner, in every state, in every town. I do believe that they over price some of the extras, like using soy milk, $.60....adds up fast.  And in the airports and hotels they OVERCHARGE by a lot.  This location was clean and they have a drive through which is great when you don't want to get out of the car!!!  Only problem, they don't give you a receipt unless you ask...Don't forget to ask for one!

They make a super huge Treinte size now?! Holy cow.  ...  ... I haven't been to a Starbucks in forever as I just cant drink all these caffeinated, rich drinks.  ...  ... I did stop in for a passion ice tea on a hot day and it did the trick. The lady at the register was nice and my drink is super easy as they just pour some tea on ice so there really isn't anything to it.

as a loyal customer of starbucks, i was highly disappointed by this location's service. ...  ... here's the story:  i ordered a skinny caramel macchiato at the blue diamond location (near my house) and asked for a little extra caramel sauce (i know that no longer makes the drink skinny, but i had a sweet tooth :).  instead of topping me off with extra sauce, they gave me an extra pump of caramel syrup (yuck!).  since i was headed to a store in chinatown, i stopped at the startbucks right off the spring mountain exit, explained my issh and asked for a little extra sauce.  the guy at the window said he couldn't alter my drink, but could make me a new one.  i took out a dollar to tip him for his kindness.  we exchanged goods, i thanked him dearly and drove off.  when i looked at the new drink he'd made me............ it was crap!  in asking for a little extra sauce, he flooded it with sauce!  1/8 of the drink was sauce.  there was a layer of sauce at the bottom of the cup... a layer on the top.  the drink was so full, it overflowed when i poked the straw in it and spilled all over my car!  ...  ... mind that i am normally not "one of those" customers... if ever i feel that i'm swaying that way, i'm overly apologetic and thankful.  mind that i pay for a $5 drink everyday, so it better taste the way i want and expect it to.  above all, mind that every starbucks i've been to has said: if you're ever unsatisfied with your drink, they'd be happy to remake it.

Starbucks is always perfect for me when it comes to service and quality as I have never had a bad experience other than the one time at this location. I had ordered a venti sized white chocolate latte in which the cup was not filled, there was a gap from the top of the cup by a few inches. I understand the price as I am ok with that but at least fill my damn cup! I called this location and spoke with a Manager who informed me that I could stop back by for a replacement coffee and from now on I should inform when I order "filled to the top". Ok so now on I inform them whenever I order anything to fill it to the top and that has prevented this from happening again. ...  ... Lately I have been craving the java chip frap, mmmm I love those chocolate coffee bits! ...  ... Thank you Starbucks for all of the tasty caffeine indulgences you have provided me with! I will be back for more!

This is by far my favorite Starbucks store.   ...  ... What separate this place from the others?  CUSTOMER SERVICE!  I have been here twice this week to do some studying and the barista's greet each customers that walks in to the store with a huge "hello/hi".  Another thing, they remember their regular customers by name and their favorite drinks.  Even at their busiest time when a line is forming, their regulars would already have their drink ready by the time they reach the cashier.  They do it all without missing a beat!   ...  ... We all know Starbucks isn't the best when it comes to coffee, but this Starbucks knows how to make a person feel like he/she is drinking the best coffee ever.  Very impressive indeed! ...  ... P.S.  I don't really like to study at Starbucks or any coffee shops for that matter because it's usually very LOUD, but this place isn't as loud as the others.

Friendly staff, close to the gym and my work. All of that meets the criteria for Starbucks, but the coffee is not as good as the local shops around Vegas.  ...  ...

I go to a lot of Starbucks but this one i have to comment on because of the customer service i received. ...  ... I recently downloaded the Starbucks app. for their rewards program.  I went to a different Starbucks a week and a half ago went in and asked the guy at the counter exactly how it works as i was a little confused on the process.  He pretty much shrugged his shoulders at me.  He didnt ask anyone else if they knew nor did he apologize that he didnt.  So i went ahead and paid for my coffee with my cash not my reward app. so i didnt get a 'gold' star which after 5 or so drinks i would get a free one.... ...  ... Anyways, today i was out by a different Starbucks and went in and was greeted by Maria, who not only took the time to explain to me how everything works, she even walked me through the step by step on my phone, and even showed me a lot of stuff i had no clue the program offered.  It took five min. and now im an old pro lol.....i appreciate more then anything when an employee knows about all aspects of their job.  She was sweet and kind and it was a great experience. ...  ... Oh and my venti pumpkin spice frapp. was AMAZING also !!! ...  ...  ... Thanks again Maria !!!

I go to this starbucks every single morning because it is convenient on the way to work.  I struggle because I'm super lazy and just wished it had a drive thru however I can't rate it lower for that.   ... At first they seemed to know folks around me which I thought was frustrating because why don't you know who I am since I come in every morning at the same time.  Then one day I complained about my drink because it was so wrong.  I order the same thing every single morning.  Since then when three certain ladies are working they are outstanding just great.  Before I even get to the counter my drink is ready and they know my name.  I love them for them five stars. ...  ... The reason it drops is because of mornings like today which I would say are few and far between but they are not.   ... I go in, I wait in a stupid long line.  I get to the front the lady says can I help you, I order my drink and she asks me what kind of milk I want.  Well I asked for skinny so I say the kind you get with skinny but I have never been asked that.  (sometimes they ask me how many pumps of syrup I want, how the heck am I suppose to know) ...  ... Then I wait I finally get my drink and the guy says nothing so I say, well have a good day.  Then I take a sip.  I ask if the drink is right, he says yes, I know something is missing (like the syrup) he says he did it right, and I'm too exhausted to argue so I just leave.  Somedays the only thing I need is to just have my consistent starbucks coffee, that will make my day start right.  That is all I want.  If I didn't like consistency or service then I would go to coffee bean or brew my own...I like that I can count on starbucks, well sometimes that is.

REVIEW #11:  3 stars  (426 chars)
I totally agree with some of the reviews on here.  There is something about this spot that just sucks.  Maybe all those people hanging outside and inside of this Starbucks.  They give you the dirty stare with you go in and out.  This is close to the strip, which is awesome but..definitely can't get over the uncomfortable feeling of being at this location.   ...  ... They made my drink correctly, so that's 3 stars for them!

REVIEW #12:  3 stars  (389 chars)
This Starbucks is just ok. I'm spoiled by ones with drive-thrus so having to get my lazy butt off the car to order a beverage isn't my favorite, but it's conveniently located and it does the trick when you're in need of a serious caffeine fix like we were on our most recent visit. Service was relatively quick and it was pretty standard fare as far as Starbucks go. ...  ... Overall A-Ok.

REVIEW #13:  2 stars  (471 chars)
Been to many locations and this is NOT MY FAVORITE.  Something about this place, the ambiance sucks.  I live close to this one but I avoid this one as much as possible.  I'm from Cali but live in Vegas now.   ...  ... I purchased a bag of coffee, had them grind it but the lady handed it to me without a bag.  Did we forget coffee particles/grinds falling out during a drive?  It was all over my car seat & the smell wasn't easy to get rid of.  Didn't like the service. .

REVIEW #14:  2 stars  (265 chars)
I love this location but the inside was crowded and other customers bumped me as they walked by. I'm used to the Baristas asking for my name after I place an order and this time they didn't ask for my name and someone almost walked off with my drink. Oh~~ hell nah!

REVIEW #15:  2 stars  (1534 chars)
Not as busy as I thought it would be 8am-10am as far as the sit ins.  It's quite spacey, I really like the layout plus they have several patio tables under shade and Einstein Bagels next door.  The staff were cool, the girl at the register took my order and asked for my name and kudos to her for actually writing my name correctly which never happens BUT when it was ready the other girl just yelled  out the order once and I wasn't sure if it was mine until it was all alone at the pick up counter waiting to be last picked for  a PE team :(.  I found a table to sit at but it wasn't wiped down SO I did it myself, one of my pet peeves at any restaurant/cafe which I didn't mind at first.  I then went to the restroom after an hour and they were out of toilet seat covers!  It breaks my heart  when that happens so I improvised  haha.  There were a total of 5 people behind the counter, not one I saw come out to wipe down tables. Again, it wasn't as busy but had several walkin orders and they were out, it was nice BUT the little things do count like toiletries  and clean tables.  So -minus 2 stars for this location. ... Ok -minus 1 more star because 30min after using the restroom, a worker went to the restroom after I did and not yet have I seen anyone go to the ladies room (except for customers) and fill the seat covers and I guess she was on break because she was chilin for little bit like a customer.  Obviously she didn't let anyone know.  If you didn't know I like to people watch, it's a great stress reliever hahah.

The coffee was great but the downfall was the limited pastries and things to eat. I've haven't seen it this low at any Starbucks location so I was pretty turned off.

Great customer service, especially from the night crew! They have never messed up on me. Great for eating healthy on campus! However, during certain times of the day it can get 25 deep. If there are at least 3 people working, the line goes by fast. If its only two...give up.

REVIEW #2:  5 stars  (124 chars)
Typically there is a line but it's a campus.the manager is my favorite person he doesn't take any bull. Never had a problem.

REVIEW #3:  4 stars  (767 chars)
It's not the greatest Starbucks to ever come into existence but it was my go-to and the fact that it was an on-campus location made it better. ...  ... Yes the lines are VERY long. The longest wait I had on the line was 20 minutes and an extra 10 minutes waiting for my drink. But what did you expect? People are wanting their caffeine and they don't want to walk out of campus to go to the other one. Because so many students and staff go there, there is always room for mistakes because they get so many people getting their drinks! So I don't condemn them for that. ...  ... Seeing that I just finished my first year of college, this Starbucks location helped me stay awake during my classes and helped me during the days where I'm running on three hours of sleep.

REVIEW #4:  3 stars  (414 chars)
Look... ...  ... This Starbucks is at UNLV, a commuter campus with few halfway edible options for food (not to mention the atrocity that is the library's Coffee Bean). It can get crowded in the morning, sure. But it's a freaking coffee shop. ...  ... The staff here is really nice as of this semester. Previous baristas have been rude, but I like these new folks. ...  ... They even draw a smiley face on your cup!

REVIEW #5:  3 stars  (732 chars)
THERE IS ALWAYS A LINE HERE....usually.  The peak times of this Starbucks is around 11 am - 4 pm.   ...  ... Try to avoid at all costs the times of: 9:45 am - 10 am, 11:15 am - 11:30, 12:45 pm - 1:00 pm, 2:15 pm - 2:30 pm, and 3:45 pm - 4:00 pm.   ...  ... These are times in between classes, so it's kind of common sense to avoid the hoards of students trying to get their caffeine fix between classes.  Usually after 5 pm, most students are heading home and the line should be fairly short.  The drinks are fair, but for some reason other Starbucks always taste better and move a lot faster too.  If you are desperate and looking for a quick caffeine fix, I would recommend getting a cup of coffee at the POD in the Student Union.

REVIEW #6:  2 stars  (494 chars)
I love Starbucks and I'm a big fan but wow. WOW. They always mess up my order, every single time and they gave me the wrong change once. My last time there, they burnt my two bagel and I nicely asked for another one and I didn't mind paying for it either. They were nice enough to make another one. But just one when I bought two. It wasn't even toasted either, it was still cold on the inside. Worst Starbucks ever. I wasn't even in the mood to ask again, I just left and angrily ate my bagel.

REVIEW #7:  2 stars  (412 chars)
Located in the food court/student union at UNLV, this Starbucks is my least favorite location. ...  ... Every time I have gone there is a line. It ranges from 5-30 people, and moves slowly. ...  ... They won't redeem the free drinks and food items I have earned on my Starbucks card. I get that this location is on a campus, but it's still annoying. ...  ... They've been out of ingredients on several occasions.

REVIEW #8:  2 stars  (417 chars)
The service is always friendly however I was overcharged and she didn't realize it. I pointed it out and she still thought it was right.  She tried to explain that it was tax, which it wasn't because the base price was $4.55 instead of $4.15.  She asked me to speak to her manager so she could explain it to me.  The manager acknowledged it was wrong but said that they don't set the prices so they can't help.  Wow!!

REVIEW #9:  1 stars  (473 chars)
I am an avid customer at Starbucks, although this one located at the UNLV campus never fails to disappoint me. I usually order a black tea unsweetened, and almost every time they add the sweetener and have to remake it. The other day, the messed up not once, but twice. ...  ... As for the ingredients, they never seem to order correctly. I have asked for a Peppermint Mocha on multiple occasions, with them being out of the Peppermint. ...  ... Nothing but disappointment.

REVIEW #10:  1 stars  (290 chars)
Starbucks at the student union is a continuous disappointment. Their cup stock is often low, they only have Grande size. Not to mention, they don't post a sign to tell you this, so after waiting in line for 15 minutes, the cashier gladly informs you that you have wasted your valuable time.

REVIEW #11:  1 stars  (423 chars)
The worst Starbucks I have ever visited. Twice this week they were out of stuff. On Monday, December 10 I ordered a soy peppermint mocha and they were out of peppermint. On Wednesday, December 12 I decided to give them a second try. I ordered a soy peppermint mocha and this time they were out of soy milk and peppermint. I'm afraid if I try them a third time they will be out of everything and just give me a cup of water.

Kristal might be the barista to make me take back all I have said about every Starbucks being the same. She made my Venti Iced Americano exactly the way I like. It was strong, dark, and had a generous amount of ice which would melt down when the espresso hit it. Instead of just loading my drink with water and a little ice, she did it the right way for beverage with the strength to keep me going for the rest of the day.

This is a Starbuck's concession in Von's. Similar to all the Von's Starbuck's it is a conducive spot to relax. Never a problem waiting on a table. The tables are spacious. And the Starbuck's coffee on the table hits the spot.

I go here for Raychelle!!  I am a Starbucks freak! I went to Seattle just to visit the original one, as well as the gift shop at the corporate offices. I will stop at least one time a day to get my Frappachino fix, and I go to a few of them around town.  ...  ... The other day I went with my mom and husband. My husband was so surprised when I started ordering at the drive through and I recognized Raychelle's voice and SHE RECOGNIZED MINE!!! She is my little Starbuck's Angel, and she always makes my visit feel special.  ...  ... My favorite drinks are Caramel Frapp light and Green Tea Frapp without added sugar. Just typing this is making me want one!

I like Starbucks. I like that they have good coffee, good drinks not coffee, and some good stuff to eat, too. It doesn't hurt that there is usually one cute girl who works there, and cute girls who are customers, too.  ...  ... I come to this location when I'm at school and want to get away for a minute. It's good to kinda relax here when you have time between classes, or even when you just don't feel like going to class. I should also mention that I like coming here because, as stated in a previous post, it's a great place to people-watch! ...  ... They have free WiFi, which is extra awesome as I like to spend time here reading/studying/trying not to get on Facebook and Yelp! all the the time.

REVIEW #3:  5 stars  (332 chars)
Ok so here is the thing, for me almost all Starbucks are the same the only thing that will distinguish it, is if it is terrible. This one is not terrible just the contrary it has a great outside area. So if you are in the neighborhood and in need of a caffeine jolt, stop on by. Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!

So in the last four months, I have been coming to this Starbucks to look for a job. I love this Starbucks.

These guys are awesome! We were visiting from Southern California and had less than desirable visits to the Starbucks in the hotels. As a former Starbucks partner I can say that the service here was perfect. On the way out my friend tripped in the parking lot and dropped his drink. I went back in to see if they could remake his drink the first thing the barista asked was if my friend was ok, and remade his drink without hesitation. After spending a week here in LV and receiving lackluster service at the hotels and casinos this Starbucks location was a much needed breath if fresh air. Keep up the great work!

REVIEW #7:  5 stars  (538 chars)
This Starbucks location is awesome! The employees are friendly. They have never messed up a drink of mine. It is next to campus (UNLV), but still feels like a getaway coffee shop. The wi-fi works great and it is right next to my girlfriend Kalila's house! It is surrounded by other great places to eat and I just can't think of anything negative to say about this Starbucks location. ...  ... Kalila likes to invent her own drinks. Her Vanilla bean frapp with banana & caramel is delicious! Bananas foster in a cup! Well.... almost. HAHA.

A Starbucks is a Starbucks, no different then any other. Pro's: The employees are always nice and polite. One even gave me extra scones because they were just going to get tossed out anyways. Con's: Because its near UNLV there always seems to be student's taking up all the seats for long periods of time. They never seem to be fully stocked up on food like the sandwiches and pastry's. But then again I am always coming late in the evening so I can't blame them if all the food got bought up earlier.

Honestly, who does not know about Starbucks? I bet the whole world could write a review about it.  ...  ... However, mine is not focused on the coffee that everyone loves. People and their coffee right? Well I am not a coffee drinker, and trust me I have tried. Again and again and again. I just cannot get past the taste.  ...  ... Those of you who join me in sticking out our tongues to coffee can still go to Starbucks. They have so much more than coffee. I am in love with their shaken green tea. Usually I hate ice tea, but their green tea is amazing to me. I cannot find anything that tastes like it. I have tried other green teas' but not like Starbucks. They also have a lemonade tea concoction, passion fruit, etc. Try something that is not coffee and you may find a new drug in the Starbucks world.  ...  ... I also enjoy their new bistro boxes. The protein one is pretty healthy and fills me up. It helps me to keep going sometimes. Who needs energy drinks when you have protein and green tea! ...  ... I always enjoy that I can sit in a big comfy chair and just take a breather before class, work, internship, etc. Whatever it is that I have, I can hang out in the corner and just breathe, bobbin my head to the house music playing at just the right volume.  ...  ... Bottom line, Starbucks is way way more than just coffee. If you haven't tried it because you hate coffee (one person I know) please try something  else, different, and if your eyes go wide do to your taste buds jumping for joy, I will indeed tell you, "I told you so."

REVIEW #14:  4 stars  (666 chars)
I frequent this particular store because of its convenient location. It's across the street from UNLV, so you know they are used to students that need a place to grab a drink and chill/study. The staff has gone through a few changes, but they all remain friendly and helpful.  ...  ... My only gripe is that the drive thru is slow. And it's always slow. When I stop by, it's pretty early in the morning, around 7am. I think they are staffed minimally (I think only 2 people) so there is a little bit of a wait, even if I am the only person in line. ...  ... Now if only they accepted my Starbucks card payments off my iphone through the drive thru, then I'll be set!

i go to this one when im early for school and dont wanna deal with the crowd at the on campus one ...  ... drive thru is actually decent. we actually had time to sit inside and eat once, but the barista forgot one of our sandwiches. they dont take long, but when you have one and you're waiting for another one it feels like forever. ...  ... all in all, i like this place because there really isnt too much of a wait, or no wait at all.

REVIEW #16:  4 stars  (1636 chars)
Located across the street from UNLV, there's this Starbucks. Located within UNLV, there's another Starbucks. A couple more blocks down the road, there's another Starbucks. They're not too hard to find. Their coffee is exactly what you'd get at any other location. ...  ... I am reviewing this place as a means of a place to study. Say what you must about Starbucks coffee, but when I need to study, I'm not too picky on flavor or quality. I just want my caffeine, a somewhat relaxed ambiance, and music mellow enough for me to drown out, yet enjoy. This Starbucks tends to pull that off. I tried studying at the nearby Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, but their choice of music is too upbeat for me to focus, like a mainstream radio station. ...  ... This Starbucks is a quaint little place. There are 4 tables inside that can seat 2 people, 1 table that can seat 4, and one large table that can seat around 6. There are a few lounging chairs about, if that's what you're looking for. Outside are many more tables, which are practically unusable during the summer because of the heat. Each table should have an outlet somewhere nearby if you have a laptop that needs juice. Plus, you do get free Wi-Fi here nowadays. ...  ... Be aware, that this place does fill up during peak hours. You might not be able to get a table at this time. I tend to go to this place whenever I'm tired of sitting in the Lied Library to study. I practically live in that library during a heavy semester, so I do need an occasional change of scenery. ...  ... Staff is friendly, caffeine is present, and the music is good. I can't complain about this place. I'm a fan.

I love Starbucks but this is not my favorite location. The area is a bit run down and that translates into the store. The coffee is as good as any other Starbucks and the WiFi works. And of course, a Starbucks that's a little run down is always better than Dunkin Donuts anywhere.

Starbucks Rewards program changes:  Gold Level, you get a free drink at 12 stars -- not 15 like before. ... No more postcards you used get in the mail telling you about your free drink. You get an email instead.  ... You no longer get a free tall beverage when you buy your pound of coffee. ...  Also, you'll no longer be able to add a syrup or soy milk for free.  ... Now you get to choose if you want to use your reward on food or drinks.... ...  ... Give me free soy back! Yes I know, it's sounds like I'm whining for something free, well, I am!  ...  ... This is the Starbucks location I frequent the most as its on my way to work, so I'm here 3 days a week. I've  seen many people come and go here, I had my favorites and my not so favorites. I feel bad for not knowing the young lad at the drive thru, who has gotten to know me over the drive thru, my drink and food order is always 100% correct with him, he's always friendly. Now, there is a new employee, she's been there a couple months, middle aged with an accent, she is grumpy, never cracks a smile, usually gets my drink order wrong along with my food order, and she gets an attitude if I ask for something, when you're ordering a breakfast sandwich, do I need to ask for a napkin?? Or if I want the green stopper, can I get it without a fowl look? Starbucks is my reward to myself for going to work, yes I realize how pathetic that sounds, but I reward myself a lot with food and drinks. So get a different job if customer service isn't for you!

This is probably the worse Starbucks I've ever been to. The bf and I just finished grocery shopping and needed a caffeine pick-me-up since it was only 7 pm. We walked in and it was pretty packed. No line or anything, but all the tables were occupied with people on their laptops. The trash was full and the sugar station was pretty dirty. I ordered a tall iced coffee with a splash of nonfat milk and the bf ordered a venti vanilla iced coffee with no milk. Pretty easy compared to drinks they usually make. They messed up the lady's order before us so they had to remake it, hence longer wait. All we ordered was a simple iced coffee but we waited about a good 8 minutes. And when our drinks were finally ready, the bf's drink was wrong because they put milk when he said no milk. So they had to remake that one as well. And the barista acted like we were such an inconvenience to her. Never again will I come to this one.  ...  ... P.S. Note to management; teach your employees some people skills. You can start by teaching them how to smile.

Try their triple shot expresso with a splash of soy milk! Extremlly strong, but never too bitter! Truly blissful once you add the soy to your drink. Another plus is the ambiance is very relaxed, and I found this to be one of the "lesser" pretensious Starbucks locations that I've visited in the Southern Nevada area. Check it out! ... btw, Skip the cake pops! They are sinfully delightful, but shockingly horrible for you! I looked up the caloric content and found that it would be better for you to eat a table spoon of butter over one of their cake pops! - UCKERS!

I have been here numerous times and don't really have an issue with the inflated prices. I knew going in that I would pay a little more solely based on the fact this SB is located inside of a casino. $3.50 for an iced tea is a little much, but it was good, and the prices are posted. I do have a problem with the customer service, however. On my latest visit the cashier seemed to just be going through the motions and her demeanor was as if I was bothering her. The barista was slow to get my drink ready, but at least he had some personality. The product is good here, as Starbucks usually is, but the customer service is in need of an overhaul, at least during my visits.

REVIEW #3:  1 stars  (801 chars)
I was so excited to see my Hotel had a Starbucks inside. I love my Starbucks and coffee in the morning. Went to get coffee and the staff here is rather rude. I wasn't greeted when we walked up to the counter and one employee was stalking the cold case and couldn't be bothered to acknowledge that they had customers. I have been a faithful customer for years and have never been treated the way I was this morning. I am not sure if this is an actual Starbucks or just licensed to sell Starbucks products. It gives the company a bad name if they allow for this store to continue this way with their rude, horrific, and mean customer service. There are many people that travel in and out of the Santa Fe Hotel and Casino, too bad Starbucks is ruining the coffee going experience for all those travelers.

24 HOUR STARBUCKS! Not too far from the Vegas strip. Plenty of seating, plenty of plugs for laptops, etc. They even have plugs under the long couch/bench thing. This place is busy all night, which is probably the reason why its not the cleanest of Starbucks. Easy fix, hire more barista's, or ones that do not think they are too good to come out behind the counter and wipe down a table or two. In their defense, I could not see how the 3 working could find time to clean or stock the display case. Needs at least 4 people on staff at all times. Upper management needs to pay more attention to this location. Right now @ 12:30am, the line is 10 deep. Who knows how many in the drive through. ...  ... Nice mix of characters walking through. If your looking for an asian girlfriend or boyfriend, this is the place to be.  Kris Kristofferson walked in while I was there. If it was not him, he has a twin.  ...  ... Chris D. - 70 year olds on laptops talking about breast implants is WHY I WANT TO BE HERE. I love quirky, different people.

Always full and crowded but the EMPLOYEES are AWESOME! Always full of energy and friendliness no matter what time of the day it is. I've been here as early as 5am and as late as 1am and YES they are just AWESOME!

Great service and very friendly. The gal from Yakima, WA was fun to talk to.

REVIEW #10:  4 stars  (310 chars)
I LOVE that this Starbucks is open 24 hours AND it has a drive thru.  Definitely needed in Vegas.  The staff was friendly, efficient, and timely and that was at 11pm.  It was refreshing to see such hardworkers that enjoy their jobs.  Nothing is wrong with having fun as long as you're working at the same time.

REVIEW #11:  4 stars  (694 chars)
I try not to review every single Starbucks and Coffee bean that I go to because probably it will be about 80% of my reviews, but I came to this one this morning for my regular coffee and this place is very nice. Nice location and parking. The place is large (or maybe because I am used to the ones in Los Angeles, which are very small) and has a lot of chairs and sofas, so even when they have a lot of customers , the place doesnt feel that crowded. The staff is very friendly (again, probably because I come from LA so I am not used to that). Free wifi (although you get that everywhere nowadays). So nothing else to add..just enjoying my Cinnamon dulce latte and writing reviews!! Enjoy.....

It is a Starbucks. Enough said! ... well, kind of  - this is a super high volume - 24 hour - non-stop machine!   Good service, good employees, but still Starbucks.

REVIEW #13:  4 stars  (229 chars)
Needed to kill some time one Saturday afternoon. Found this on the map. Rather roomy with multiple spots for electronics, but it may be full. Oh, and if the bathroom is locked make sure someone didn't just lock it on the way out.

REVIEW #14:  4 stars  (2274 chars)
Ok I know thinking what is there really too add too another Starbucks review. It not as though its major chain and seen one seen them all. It not often that you find ones that stay open 24 hours. I did notice that they do close from one hour in day 3:30-4:30. I still remember the first time heard them staying open 24/7 like YES Frappuccino urge good too go! Naturally I had too order one. I went with one of the newer (on my menu brought it back) ones Mocha Cookie Crumble. Good. Honestly think next time would stick with the safe or my favorite just straight up Mocha or Caramel. I never got much of hint of Cookie in it, Mocha definitely had nice flavor, and Crumble no idea where that was in it. Still any Frappuccino on hot Vegas day is a beautiful thing.  ...  ... The interior design talk about completely updated or really has been years since the last time stopped by this location. It felt like night and day for me. Now you have whole deli section with sandwiches, other drinks besides coffee (bottle water, fruit juices, and lot of different selection can choose) can purchase, and like the fact its separate rather then in front of the register area. Still have nice display of baked goodies like normal. Instead of all stand up tables or tables. They still do but have one long rectangle table more like family table can sit down with lap top get stuff done and have your coffee. The artwork hanging all around the walls really modern too the lighting fixtures. All creating great ambience too kick back with coffee chill do some reading, talking stories with friends, or going on lap top do whatever. The only negative is this location is pretty busy all the time.. I go too the gym all the time in the same shopping plaza and always people going in and out or hanging outside little patio area.  ...  ... The service was great! I did find it odd that she never mention about HH price on Frappuccino from 3-5. I was wondering why my grande was so cheap. Unfortunately only promotion till next week.  ...  ... If looking for a laid back Starbucks one that nice size, great place too people watch too since so busy, great ambience, and relax with friends. I would recommend coming too this location. Hopefully able too find spot too sit down can be a drawback.

REVIEW #15:  4 stars  (820 chars)
One of the only Starbucks I actually LIKE to drink at. They're very consistent, most likely due to the huge number of customers they get on a daily basis. This place is always packed.  ...  ... Aside from the consistent drinks, the abundance of outlets, its close proximity to my house, and 24 hour opening hours make it a great place to study.  ...  ... However, it's often TOO packed. The outside seating is always full of taxi drivers and Asian international students. It's impossible to walk into this Starbucks without wading through a thick cloud of cigarette smoke.  ...  ... The seating indoors is pretty abundant, but the number of single patrons taking up tables that fit 2-4 people are equally abundant. ...  ... I try to come here after midnight for late night studying if I really can't concentrate at home.

REVIEW #16:  4 stars  (1218 chars)
Sniff sniff  ... Aahh nothing like the smell of coffee. I'm not really crazy about     starbucks, but I am a caffeine addict, and now that I took the first step on accepting my Addiction is time to take the second step...... I'll have a  medium caramel frappuccino with an extra  shot of espresso please! ( guess my nationality).  ...    This location is open 24 hours and has a drive thru. the place is very spacious, it has a few couches and tables. People using their lap tops taking advantage of free wi fi, talking to friends, enjoying their pimped up cup of joe. Only a few blocks away from the strip it gets a little busy. ...   My coffee was good, can't complain, the secret is in the coffee. Anything with coffee tastes good. Service was also good, the Batista was fast and attentive. It may seem like an easy job to do but is very hard to deal with customers going through withdrawals and in need of their quick fix. The only problem I had was that  I ordered a medium and got the grande, (lost in translation) no big deal, other than that it was a great experience! I'm sure I'll be back for more! ...                 p.s. Always tip the barista. They're in control of the caffeine. If you know what I mean.

REVIEW #17:  4 stars  (555 chars)
Some people go to coffee shops to study, work, socialize, whatever...  I go to them get some caffeine, and it is usually when I am headed to work. So for me, the faster I can get in and out, the better...  ...  ... This is why a Starbucks with a drive-thru will almost always get more stars from me then ones without. And this location has a drive-thru. This location also has cheerful employees.  ...  ... If you do want to go inside, as other reviewers mentioned parking can be rough if you try to park up front... There is ample parking in back though.

REVIEW #20:  4 stars  (525 chars)
This has to be the busiest Starbuck's in the Southwest Valley. This cafe has been hyper-jumping both times I have been here. It feels more like being in a party than a cafe.  ...  It also looks like it was recently refurbished. There are.various seating arrangements. The neatest seating are the three stools at the counter. ...  This Starbucks is the Southwest version of the Eastern at I-215 Starbuck's. It is hyper jumping. Open 24 hours, with thr exception that it closes 1-4 on Mondays. And adjacent to a Fitness center.

REVIEW #21:  4 stars  (245 chars)
This is 1 of 2 24 hour locations (not in a casino). The other is on Eastern. I love going here on my way to the strip. This is a very busy, but very efficient location. Great friendly service and my favorite drinks all night long. Free wifi too!

REVIEW #22:  4 stars  (1095 chars)
This is the closest starbucks to my work,  so its where i head for my last minute hot chocolate in the morning or if my boss wants one.  This location is great if your on the go because of he drive-thru featured at this location.  ...  ... Because it is on Tropicana, you are gonna have a small wait in a cramped location. The staff is super knowledgeable and pretty quick, but since it's on a main drag, visible from Tropicana, next to about 10 store's and the gym, and across the street from the park..it is constantly backed up. Because of the small layout and limited seating, this is not the ideal location to sit and just enjoy yourself with your friends-if you would like that type of scenario you should probably get your coffee to go.  ...  ... The staff makes good small talk if there not too busy, but it seems like the staff is always changing. They always make my order correctly, but I don't have a very challenging order - Hot Chocolate most of the time.  ...  ... Sometimes pan-handlers can take away from the experience, but eh whatcha gonna do? ...  ... Cheers! ...  ... ~MikeB

REVIEW #23:  3 stars  (839 chars)
1 star by default for being a mostly reliable chain cafe ... 1 star for great wifi and chill atmosphere ... 1 star for being open 24 hrs ...  ... Minus 2 stars for rude baristas who don't understand the first thing about customer service. Customer service tips for the baristas: Acknowledge your patrons, especially when there is a long line forming instead of having a prolonged conversation with your friend/coworker. Make eye contact with customers (etiquette 101). Don't act like customers are impinging on your time and everything they ask for is a nuisance. You are there to serve not be served on.   ...  ... We all understand that this is a busy location and that you have to deal with a lot of people. However, it's no excuse for dropping the level of customer service. If you want decent tips, then raise the bar of your service.

REVIEW #24:  3 stars  (871 chars)
excellent barristers, great clientelle, all Asian and Ethiopean customers, a few Arab nation people, at midnight all the young Japanese and Chinese girls with beach blonde hair come in wearing spike heels and the latest fashions, many of my fellow students from UNLV also. Homeless people and meth-addicts have a bad habit of using and holding up the rest-rooms., coffee could be better (stronger) some of the barristers have a habit of brewing it rather weak to their liking. All the employees are the best instead of the short fat guy that is rude with no personality on the later shift. dont go for the free wi-Fi..its the slowest in the world, One big problem they have is homeless people sleeping in the recliners and snoring loud. The employees never wake them up or are too busy to go over and shake them. Lots of free sleepers. so you wont be able to get a chair.

REVIEW #25:  3 stars  (507 chars)
I like the interior and location of this Starbucks.  I used to work at the Home Depot across the street -- so I got used to this place before work.  Anyway, besides applying here and not even getting called for an interview, lol,  I liked this place...pretty large and comfortable seating inside.  Fast and friendly service...and with a drive-thru.  Parking is horrible though...as it shares it with like 4 other businesses...and there is also a Dennys right there.  Oh well...nice Starbucks never-the-less.

REVIEW #26:  3 stars  (247 chars)
On Saturday morning, at 10:00, there was only one person in line in front of me. The building was packed, however. I ordered my usual Vanilla Latte, but it tasted slightly burnt and under flavored. I was in a hurry, so I didn't ask them to fix it.

REVIEW #27:  3 stars  (706 chars)
One of the few Starbucks that are open 24hrs.  No matter what time you come here, it's always filled with people.  This is not a place where you can study unless you're one that can study in an active and noisy setting.   ...  ... I came here at 3am and there were still a good amount people.  Free WiFi but more of the concern is finding a seat where you can use your laptop.  Would have given this a 2 star but I kinda have a crush on one of the barista in this joint. She's cute, cool funny personality...oh i better shut up, i'm going off the subject.  ...  ... So yea, this place is very active and crowded so I recommend another place if you go during the early hours because this place gets crowded.

REVIEW #28:  3 stars  (292 chars)
This Starbucks gets my order wrong at least 1 of 4 times. This is the closest one to my office so I go here often. My biggest gripe is that I don't want to have to check everything I got before I leave the store, if I get stuff for co-workers I am sure they don't want my gems in their drink.

REVIEW #29:  3 stars  (155 chars)
Usually less busy at 8am than the other Starbucks locations in Spring Valley and the drive thru is open again! Free wifi as usual and lots of place to sit.

REVIEW #30:  3 stars  (703 chars)
Well what kinda stinks about this place is made up for with really great tasting drinks. Most starbucks I go to, I engage in a chat with the baristas. As busy as this one is, you can forget about chatter and just watch your drink become another cog in the machine. Speaking of machines, this starbucks uses that nifty label printer that makes a sticker on the side of your cup. Kinda cool, depending on your mood. ...  ... This location has long waits too and it is a happening spot. You probably will have to go into "stalker status" just to get a seat.  ...  ... 3 stars simply because it has goods and bads. Good tasting drinks. Bad place to engage in random chatter or meet with someone to catch up.

REVIEW #31:  2 stars  (155 chars)
Drive-thru, good, customer service, good. However, i always order one type of coffee and they never taste same. It shows me that the training is very poor.

REVIEW #32:  2 stars  (906 chars)
I had just arrived to Vegas when I got to this Starbucks. I needed to get online and do some stuff before hitting the town. Much to my dismay, this place was really busy and packed! I couldn't believe how crazy it was in there. I didn't have a choice though, I had to wait it out until someone got up from their seat. There's a good amount of room to sit...if you can find a seat! So if you're looking for somewhere to go and get some work done, find a different Starbucks. I went here on two different occasions and it was the same both times.  ...  ... That said, the guy who took my order was cool, but the baristas looked like they wanted to shoot themselves. No personality, no interaction. I don't know if I blame them though because they must be going non-stop in that place. The guy dropped my panini on the floor, but he got me a new one no problem. Just the icing on the cake for this experience.

REVIEW #33:  1 stars  (287 chars)
Here's the thing: I love Starbucks. I get at least 3 lattes everyday and use the Internet access. At this Starbucks the Internet wasn't working, the electrical outlets didn't work, and it was so dirty I didn't wanna sit down. I went to the starbucks down the street and was much happier.

REVIEW #34:  1 stars  (1216 chars)
I can't believe I am giving a Starbucks a 1 star review. ...  ... That being said, I stopped in at this Starbucks after a meeting with my photographer for my wedding and before I had to be at work. It was convenient for me and in the area. There's a drive-thru, but because I had plenty of time before I had to be at work I figured I would just go in. ...  ... The place was full of people, but there were some free seats. I walked right up and put in my order. Mocha, iced, non fat, no whip. Doo doo doo.... So I figure I'll go sit down at a table and wait. Surely I will hear them call my drink. NOPE. ...  ... Not once did I hear my drink called. NOPE. DIDN'T CALL MY DRINK. So I walk up to the bar (mind you, it's really only been about 4 minutes, but there was ONLY 2 people who ordered after me) and I see my drink, just effing sitting there. As I see it, the barista starts to take it away and gives me this "WTF do you want?" look. And then he snottily says, "Are you waiting for a drink?" And I said, "YES" and he says, "Well we've been calling this one out for awhile." ...  ... YEA. CUZ I TOTALLY DIDN'T HEAR YOU CALL MY DRINK IN THE QUIET, SMALL AREA WE'RE ALL IN RIGHT NOW. ...  ... What a little bitch.

REVIEW #35:  1 stars  (991 chars)
I really don't like leaving bad reviews but this place has horrible service, dirty bathrooms, always out of paper towels and the heavier set lady who's name i forgot is always in a bad mood and giving me dirty looks every time. She either hates her job or is so well established in this place that she could care less about the service she provides.  ...  ... I go in the restroom and it is pretty filthy. Dirty floors, no paper towels, it didn't seemed like they were under staffed but maybe they are if they can't get around to it enough in such a busy location. I could easily cope with all that if the service was good but the employees here need an attitude adjustment. It wasn't just her, it was also one of the darker skin gentlemen who's name I also can't remember. I guess it's for the better but next time I will get my coffee in town square where the energy is good and employees treat you like a real guest. You can even taste their bad attitude by the burnt coffee they're make.

REVIEW #36:  1 stars  (324 chars)
Super slow service. Don't come here. They had five people working on a Sunday morning. Zero people in the drive thru. Only one person was working the dine-in customers with 8 people in line. Three workers were waiting for the drive thru line just talking and doing nothing. The exact same thing happened on Saturday as well.

REVIEW #37:  1 stars  (578 chars)
Terrible drive through experience.  Terrible service.  We were prepared for a long wait the line at the drive-in was crazy but we weren't prepared for every food item we ordered to be out, after specifically asking if it was available. To top that off the substitutions we were offered were also out.  Insult to injury this is the second Las Vegas Starbucks I have been to that refused to make items off the secret menu. Really?? Every other city I have been to will serve a grasshopper frapachino... I will not be back to this store and I am filling a complaint with corporate.

REVIEW #38:  1 stars  (756 chars)
This place is probably one of the busier Starbucks in town wing open 24/7. ...  ... Although I love the fun personality of the baristas at Starbucks.. ...  ... Asking me if I wanted a hot or cold frapp and proceeding to get annoyed with my response is definitely not funny. ...  ... "I'd like a grande pumpkin spice frappucino." ...  ... "do you want that hot or cold?" ...  ... "I'd like the pumpkin spice frappucino please?" ...  ... "I heard you the first time do you want it hot or cold?" ...  ... "... Cold?" ...  ... "ugh next window please, you have no sense of humor" ...  ... And no I don't have a bad sense of humor, you have a bad way of earning tips. ...  ... Insulting your customers, not apologizing, and having an attitude= bad for business.

I read the reviews but decided to stop anyway.  I actually stopped on three occasions and noticed that they were busy on all three stops.  Despite being overwhelmed, the baristas were very friendly and got me my drink within a few minutes of ordering.  No complaints; except they may be too good and too busy, but they still do just fine.

REVIEW #4:  3 stars  (1392 chars)
This will be a moderate review or in Starbuck's terminology, a grande review. The best way to summarize the Starbuck's at the southeast corner of Decatur and Charleston Boulevards is BIG ON CONVENIENCE AND SHORT ON COMFORT. ...  ...   The location sits at the corner of two hyper-busy Las Vegas highways in a Super Walmart Shopping Center surrounded by fast food places. If you are shopping, eating out, or cruising along eastbound Charleston and north and southbound Decatur (Decatur entrance controlled by a traffic signal) this is a convenient Starbuck's for a caffeine boost. ...  ...   This has to be one of the tiniest Las Vegas Starbucks that I have visited. It just isn't very conducive to relaxing. There are only four tables, five counter stools, and a couch; which can fill up quickly in a hyper-busy area. The standard handicap table is nonexistent. On another note, a password combo is necessary to access the rest room. Forget about a drive-thru. It is attached to a Panda Express and Jamba Juice. ...  ...   This Starbuck's needs some work to be the third place that it is supposed to be. I would not be surprised if Starbuck's rebuilds this location nearby as a modern third place with a drive-thru. ...  ... *This Starbuck's is shown in an incorrect location. I checked into a Decatur Boulevard location that shows this store. Oh well. ...  ... The 2013 Yelp 100. Review #160

I agree with Mike G, this location has pleasant barista's.  I've been hit on by two of them.  One played for the other team.  Still flattering in my book. ...  ... Once my wife was with me.  She was amused.  Really. ...  ... Seriously, though, I do like this location.  I've probably been here 10 times and had good service every time.  I often get a Mocha, extra hot.  Actually scalding.  They'll make it that way for me.  No waiver to sign or anything!

Basic Starbucks. Busy drivethru. ...  ... No "I'll be with you in a few". or " Just a minute". ...  ... We sat there and waited a few minutes before anyone came over the speaker. ... Odd, because the drive thru was not empty. ...  ... Ordered our drinks, they tasted decent..and we went on our way.

REVIEW #9:  3 stars  (385 chars)
I've been generally satisfied with this place except for one incident today when they screwed up the syrup on my cinnamon dolce frappuccino. I've had this particular flavor every other day for frappuccino happy hour, and when this came out tasting like a caramel or possibly a coffee frappuccino, I was fairly disappointed. I expect consistency from chains, and it didn't happen today.

REVIEW #10:  3 stars  (409 chars)
I've cut back on my caffeine intake ever since I peaked at 10 cups a day and started getting heart palpitations - erm not so pleasant - but I'm still up for coffee every once in a blue moon. ...  ... The new Pikes Peak Roast is strong and not too bitter - amazing, a good basic coffee at Starbucks, what's this place coming to.  This location has pleasant baristas, never a line, a little off the beaten path.

REVIEW #11:  3 stars  (435 chars)
My experiences with this location are all drive thru. I cannot attest to the barrista's or the inside of the place but they are pretty fast and friendly here. ...  ... It's your standard starbucks. It doesn't have the people that I love at my old location near my old house so maybe that's why I am lacking a little luster in this review.  ...  ... But they are good with the drinks and have not messed up anything I have ever ordered.

this is a good store , they make good drinks and the people are very nice. the workers from the restaurant next store are always sitting at the tables outside the entrance by the pick up counter making it so other guests can not relax at the tables. would have given another star but every time i get my drink there is whip cream on it even thou i tell them no whip. i see them taking it off for people at drive up  also so they are just like robots and put the drink together like Starbucks says.

This is my favorite Starbucks! I stop here often, I like the fresh coffee, food and pastries! The employees are kind and efficient (especially the drive through (Michael) he always has a great smile and willing to answer questions on different selections and is knowledgeable about the different coffees for sale at the moment, which is nice because I don't have to go in and look, I can trust his judgement because I know he has studied the coffee of the month! The best for me!

Yippee, a real Starbucks! So many of those Casino hotels have Starbucks in them but I just cannot think if those as real locations.  ...  ... We found two nice comfy chairs to relax and enjoy our lattes, which were as expected and not as high priced as some of the Starbucks on the strip!

This is a much overlooked Starbucks at the eastern edge of McCarran by Russell and Eastern. ...  ... There is a drive through which can present a problem when it's busy.

Though I'm not a coffee drinker, I like this place. ... They have a large variety of breads, cakes, buns, etc., all of which I've sampled. ... I imagine that they all go very well with hot coffee. ... I've tried some of their cold coffee drinks and their pretty good. ... There is ample parking and seating. ... The bathroom is clean, the whole place in general is clean. ... Here's something unique...I've been their every week for the past month, and I've seen the bug exterminator there twice (he sprayed the outside of the building). ... Some of you might think that this is a negative but I view it as a positive. ... They are obviously taking precautions to avoid a potential infestation. ... I think that's commendable, whether they've had past problems or not. ... They don't pressure people to buy something, so you can just work on your laptop, or relax for a while (but people always order coffee). ... The service is good, and they even bring your order to the table if they're not swamped. ... It's a nice, quiet place to get out of the sun and grab a snack.

REVIEW #10:  4 stars  (445 chars)
We went there early (6:30 am or so) on a Tuesday morning. We were staying near Main Street Station, and this was a convenient location that was easier to access than some of the Starbucks in the Fremont area.  ...  ... Staff was friendly and efficient and our drinks were good. Everything including the bathrooms were cleaned and stocked. At that time of day plenty of room to work and reliable wifi. Exactly what I expect and like at Starbucks.

REVIEW #11:  3 stars  (541 chars)
It's a Starbucks just like all other Starbucks, only this one is constantly busy.  It always seems to be near impossible to find somewhere to sit down and enjoy the cup of coffee you just ordered.  With that said the employees always seem to get my drink right and out to me quickly.  They are well trained and friendly. ...  ... The drive thru is difficult to maneuver into, especially if you are in a large vehicle.  Also, the shopping center is difficult to get into and get out of especially if you want to make a left turn when leaving.

REVIEW #12:  3 stars  (36 chars)

REVIEW #13:  3 stars  (272 chars)
This is a no frills Starbucks. It's a drive-thru so that's handy, but the parking lot is so cramped it can get really backed up and cause a problem when they're busy. Service was standard. They are pretty quick and I don't have to wait too long when I'm waiting in my car.

REVIEW #14:  2 stars  (451 chars)
Disappointed in Starbucks today. My Venti quad caramel macchiato was horrible.  ...  ... I looked on the outside of the cup to see what They gave me and there was no white paper or writing on the cup.  ...  ... Whatever they made me wasn't what I ordered . I can't say they were busy at 0530 on a Sunday with me and one other car in the drive thru.  ...  ... Disappointing Starbucks. The staff at the drive thru was friendly that's why u have 2 stars.

REVIEW #15:  2 stars  (277 chars)
Terrible customer service.  I think they burned my drink because I sent it back.  I said no ice and it felt like everyone rolled their eyes.  Starbucks should have a laid back feel, not a diva feel.  Wanna be a diva?  Drink rockstar and quit Starbucks.  Love lattes though.  :)

REVIEW #16:  2 stars  (315 chars)
The process at this store is really slow and disorganized. No one really looks like they know what they are doing, and the service is extremely slow. The trash was overflowing and the cafe tables were dirty. They did clean them partially once while I was here, but after about 30 min, not the required every 10 min.

REVIEW #17:  2 stars  (28 chars)
worst drive thru design ever

REVIEW #18:  1 stars  (812 chars)
Horrible.  I am a strict vegan.  I ordered a latte with soy milk at the drive trying thru and drove off.  Halfway to work & 6 sips in I realized something tastes off.  I opened the cup to discover whipped cream at the top of my cup.  I am enraged!  Obviously if someone orders soy they are either vegan or lactose intolerant so adding whipped cream defeats the purpose & makes no sense.  I called to complain & the manager offered to make me a new drink (too late, I was already at work for my 7am shift) or I could come back later for a free coffee voucher.  No thanks, I dont want your mediocre coffee.  Do yourself a favor and drive down the street to Sunrise Coffee on Sunset, east of Eastern.  They have an amazing,  competent staff, & the quality of their coffee is 100% better than Starbucks burnt coffee.

REVIEW #19:  1 stars  (505 chars)
Ok this is suppose to be Starbucks, where we pay an arm and a leg for coffee and SERVICE! If this place wasn't so close to my house, we'd avoid it. ... They are the worst! The server Greg doesn't know what are in the drinks and doesn't ask for your name so other people get to pick up your drinks. ... The other workers aren't much better. In fact while I'm sitting here writing this review there's another customer asking for a manager-lol! The guy responded we're all assistants here, what a load of bs.

REVIEW #20:  1 stars  (552 chars)
Will never come here again.  Ordered a Cafe Vanilla Cappuccino at 8:45pm, along with 2 other drinks for some employees at the business where I work at.  I came back to the business and realized that this drink was all whipped cream (which has since melted) and barely any drink.  I came back to the store around 9:01pm, and asked politely if they would either get me a new drink or refund the money I paid since I know they cant make another one.  They basically told me to F-Off, we're closed, come back tomorrow.  Avoid this location like the plague.

REVIEW #4:  3 stars  (5057 chars)
STARBUCKS (Part I) ...  ... Being a quasi-Starbucks junkie pretty much gives me an irrevocable consumer right and reasonable amount of credibility to throw in my $50 worth of opinion.  Why $50? because that's how much my automatic SB gold card reload is worth every month.   ...  ... I grew up in the PNW, mostly in the Seattle area where Starbucks was born, and where locals, ironically and deliberately avoid Starbucks and patronize other local and smaller coffee shops, where my friends and I frequented Vivace Coffee on Broadway in Capitol Hill.  I didn't turn to Starbucks until after I left the US and was stationed overseas.  It was one of those things I did whenever I felt homesick and wanted to touch base with the motherland and felt the need to re-enforce my being an American. Then, it grew on me. My drink of choice:   (Summer/Spring) Venti Iced Mocha, light whip or (Fall/Winter) Extra Hot Venti Mocha, no whip.   ...  ... My all time favorite Starbucks has to be the one in Rhodes, Decadence, Greece (my review will be forthcoming).  My least favorite has to be this 24/7 Starbucks with drive Thur. ...  ... Starbucks is Starbucks wherever you go. You'll get the very same mediocre pricey coffee drink they're famous for, but the only way one sets apart from the other is the degree of customer service, the ambience and the way the general interior areas conducive to enjoying a cup of joe.  As expected in any Starbucks, you will get the customary greetings albeit superficial.  The staff is trained and programmed to say and do that accompanied by their banal smiles and trite perkiness.  Once your order is rung,  you're nothing but a tall, grande or a venti cup of coffee :).  I've spent numerous hours here almost on a daily basis.  I've  come to know some of the regulars and have become oblivious to everything not so good about this place. I have to admit, however,  that sometimes it does get under my skin.  It's like going to a reputable Chinese restaurant where you know and what you only care about is the excellent food, and will keep on coming back despite the fact (and you being fully aware) that "good customer service" is something that is not and will never be on the menu.  The only difference is that I come here not for their excellent drinks but because  of its proximity to where I live (accessibility) and it being open 24/7 (convenience). ...  ... This Starbucks is, most often than not, packed with students during school seasons btwn noon and midnight (especially towards the evening) who are studying (?) hours on end.  Some with just an order of one drink and multiple free refills of iced water, some bringing with them lunch bags, dinner boxes, veggies in Ziploc bags, bottles of soda pop, munchies and snacks in small plastic containers, or food ordered from nearby restaurants (pizza, rice bowls, wraps), and thermos bottles.  I've seen some bring their blankets, extra sweatshirts, and some even show up in their PJ's.   The campers are pretty much the same faces and same group of students just about every day!. Good luck if you're thinking about coming here during midterms or final exams. This Starbucks is the unofficial library/group study room of the various Las Vegas academes.   ...  ... Busier than your typical Starbucks, this location's staff (or understaff) gets so busy(overworked), to the point of being overwhelmed, that their bathrooms are hardly checked and cleaned.  And since there are always cramming students camping in, the actual lounge is hardly kept cleaned and kept in order.  More often than not, you'll have to ask and remind the staff that they're out of  tissue paper in the bathroom, or out of napkins, milk or sugar.  I can only assume that they do all their organizing and cleaning up when the flow of customers slows down (during wee hours).  I also noticed how fast their staff turnover is.  It seems like they have new baristas/staff every other month or so (unless they rotate their shifts).  Their wi-fi connection's reliability is mediocre at best. There was even a time when it was literally down for over a month.  The staff knew about it but there were no signs saying that they were having wifi issues, and if you asked the staff,  their response was : "Yeah, we know!".  (it was during those times when I didn't see any campers, and the tables and chairs were for the taking).     ...  ... Don't get me wrong.  You'll get your drink alright but you have to pay special attention (or literally stand by the pick up counter) or you will never know that your name/order has been called and your drink has been sitting on the counter!  Had they ever gotten my drink wrong?  Yes, on more than one occasion.  Sometimes it didn't bother me and didn't ask for a replacement and sometimes I did (contingent upon my mood, or how busy the barista was).  Besides, the staff can be genuinely friendly and chatty, when not busy.   ...  ... This may be my least favorite Starbucks and yet it's the one place I always choose to go to and go back to.......over and over again.

REVIEW #5:  3 stars  (413 chars)
This Starbucks location isn't much different than any other Starbucks.  ... The staff here are friendly enough and it's never really been packed anytime I've been there, and I am usually there about 4-5 days a week. ... The facility is usually pretty clean. The parking situation here isn't the best, but it's not terrible. ... You can get the same over-priced, mediocre coffee we're all used to here, no problem.

Service was awful my brothers and I went in to Starbucks today we weren't even line and were looking at the menu the older lady at the cashier kept rolling her eyes at us and seemed annoyed that we weren't ready to Order her nasty attitude and impatientness helped determine that we aren't coming here again

If you ever need the secret to crafting a cappuccino without any espresso, this is the place to go. I can forgive one honest mistake. Repeating it, then not offering to make it right is just embarrassing. ...  ... Only go here if you don't care that you get what you order.

Superior motivation, stable crew.  ...  ... WARNING: This location primarily serves local businesses and the employees who work there who are regulars at this store.

I frequent this Starbucks on a daily basis (sometimes more than once a day!) Monday thru Friday.  They have a great staff, always friendly and just an overall great team!  I must say that this Starbucks is frequently busy, but they do such a great job with the amount of people that are in there at once, definitely a good experience.  Great store!

REVIEW #5:  4 stars  (882 chars)
I used to come to this location all the time, as I work around the corner.  ... Every employee here knew my name, and knew my drink when I would walk in.   ...  ... I stopped going for a while, just cutting back my spending and my coffee intake... ...  ... The staff has completely changed, which made me sad...I always got such great service from the other girls.  But...everyone here now is super nice as well.  I've been in a time or two since the change over and have never had bad service.  ...  ... This location is very small, and is usually pretty busy, but I've been known to set up shop with my laptop on one of the smaller tables early in the morning before the rush.  Its crowded and loud, so I recommend headphones if you don't want to hear all the noise. ...  ... Drinks are standard, like every other Starbucks.  What sets them apart is their friendly staff.   ... :D

REVIEW #6:  4 stars  (654 chars)
No Drive Thru, outdoor seating and indoor seating is limited and the entire place seemed a bit cramped. I came in relay quick, ordered my tea, used to the restroom and took off since I was in a bit of a hurry but even to get to the restroom was strange from the design of the place.  ...  ... The parking lot is shared with a few other businesses including some large building, whatever Aristocrat is... The parking lot was pretty busy, lots of people coming and going.  ...  ... I just stopped in because I was in the area... It's just a place to come in, get a drink and go. I personally wouldn't come in here to study or anything. Good for what it is.

REVIEW #10:  4 stars  (744 chars)
The layout is a little whacky but it's in a great location and it's a lifesaver!  I remember my first time in Vegas a few years ago waking up with a killer headache and wanting to eat the coffee grounds in the hotel room because I needed a jolt and a migraine cure.  That's when I first found this Starbucks and it was my savior.  Pretty sure I stuck a straw in a Venti and sucked away while I chewed Advil LiquiGels like they were Skittles.  Anyways, I was just back a couple months ago and frequented it again for a few days.  Customer service has always been friendly for as busy as they are.  Nothing bad to say about them!  Make sure you locate this one the night before so you can crawl over there whenever you wake up the next afternoon.

REVIEW #11:  4 stars  (348 chars)
Well, what to say.. It is Starbucks! Always good, still have to remind staff, ICE FIRST! It's like, "Laces out people!" I can read the manual too I have google. ...  ... Every one here is friendly, professional and they seem pretty happy to be honest... ...  ... People watching here is good, a bit cramped, but still it's Starbucks, coffee, yummz!

REVIEW #12:  4 stars  (373 chars)
You would think that Starbucks would get 5 stars no matter what the location.  This one doesnt.  No drive thru, so you must go in, it's cramped in there, there are very few chairs to sit and enjoy your beverage and there is almost always a line in there!  The drinks are pretty consistent, and its 4 blocks from home , so those are the only things that keep me going there.

REVIEW #13:  3 stars  (784 chars)
It's a Starbucks, so usually it should get a 4-star rating to just begin.  HOWEVER.... ...  ... The seating area is crowded and to navigate your way to the cashier to order is a mess.  The place where you get your drinks from the barista is also right against the door which means if there is a drink line, then that blocks incoming and outgoing traffic.  Along with the crowded seating area, trying to get coffee here is like trying to navigate an accident where it goes from 4 lanes to 1. ...  ... Drinks wise, it's typical after Starbucks had their worldwide shutdown training.   Consistent drinks across the board.   But the whole having to navigate through a sea of people is not really my taste in store layout.  It'd be a lot better to have pick-up on the far end of the store.

REVIEW #14:  3 stars  (974 chars)
Small Starbucks in a business park. It's surrounded by offices so it caters to the people who work in those office buildings. It's much smaller than your normal Starbucks, so don't expect to come here and lay out your laptop, papers, food, and spend a few hours here doing work or relaxing.  ...  ... I'm not giving 3 stars for the place, but for the drinks I've gotten from here thus far. Compared to the Starbucks on my side of town, where my drinks always come out pretty much perfect, and the Starbucks on the Air Force Base, where I also frequent, this Starbucks gave me "okay" drinks. ...  ... For instance yesterday I ordered my typical Non-Fat Ice White Mocha with no whip and I left with it. When I got in my car and was going down the road, I took a sip and thought it tasted way, way too bitter. It almost had a sour undertone to it.  ...  ... I understand not every drink is going to come out perfect, but I've yet to receive a perfect drink from this Starbucks.

REVIEW #15:  3 stars  (235 chars)
When I'm in serious need of a caffeine fix, this place does the trick. It doesn't have a drive thru, so not as convenient as some but sometimes cravings can't be thwarted by a little detail like that. Service is standard and efficient.

The best Starbucks in the southwest for the mornings. My roommate and I live right in between this one and the one on flamingo and we prefer this one.

My go-to Starbucks near my office. It's just 55 seconds away. The drive thru line can really get out of hand but it moves along pretty fast. They never mess up on my order. And nothing negative to say about the staff. Usually they are eager to help.  ...  ... Coming out of Starbucks to turn left Onto Fort Apache again can get pretty crazy. The 2 way stop is ridiculous. If you're there during a pretty busy time you'll be waiting at that stop for a while. I suggest putting a 4 way stop. But that has nothing to do with Starbucks. Just ranting.

REVIEW #17:  4 stars  (381 chars)
The drive thru can be a bit of a wait in the mornings, but it is on my way to work! Service has always been outstanding and who can beat a Caramel Frap or an iced Green Tea for a hot or cold day? I do have to say that 3-5 bucks for Starbucks definitely adds up and if you decide to get a banana nut bread or something you can go broke eventually. It's a chain, but a good chain. =)

REVIEW #22:  3 stars  (679 chars)
I am not an adventurous coffee or tea drinker. I like it strong and black. Do not alter or dilute the flavor of a good coffee or tea with additives. Starbucks does not have the best coffee. They tend to always have that over roasted, almost burnt flavor to their blend.  ...  ... What I do like about this location is the seating. Time to recuperate was a necessity after a rough brunch. A chill in the air during mini golf helped the process, but a hot drink with a punch was needed to sober us all up. We spent almost three hours camping out at a table discussing various matter and never felt like we needed to get up. When a coffee shop can accommodate campers, it is a plus.

I love Starbucks but not particularly this location. ...  ... I frequent this location because it's closest to my home, but there are so many things that bother me about it. ...  ... 1) It's always freezing here, bring a jacket. I've complained to the staff and they tell me their thermostat has never worked properly. At least they are nice about it, but not much they can do. ...  ... 2) There's a crazy man who frequents here. He talks to himself and talks about other customers under his breath. It's rude and he talks loud enough that everyone around can hear what he's saying. I've come close to punching him out a few times.. Thank God it hasn't come to that yet. ...  ... 3) I've been coming here 5 or more days a week for nearly a year now. I'm happy to say the staff has recently learned my name. ...  ... The drinks are good, the staff is helpful, and they have a drive thru. But I wouldn't recommend stopping if there's another Starbucks on your way.

I tried coming here at 7am on a weekday which was bad, huge line made me come back on a Saturday at which time I ordered a cookie crunch machiatto frap, I was interested in a Cap'N Crunch Frap, but I didn't have the recipe on-hand since it's from the secret menu so I opted out of that order since the girl didn't know it off the top of her head since she said alot of people come in with new secret menu orders, so it wasn't a big deal but the cookie frap I got wasnt bad, but a little too much ice blended in so it lost a bit of the flavor.

This location is a hit or miss, which can be said about all Starbucks locations. And I'm talking about my drink accuracy really.

I come here everyday, order the SAME drink and they still don't know my name and act confused with my drink at times getting it wrong. It's very annoying. Also when I come with family or friends they ask "is that it" after every drink, when they should say "what else can I get for u?" Which opens opportunity for up selling and is polite. Manage should know this... I used to be a supervisor there. The baristas make no effort for small talk, I would def be nicer and tip if they were nicer to me.

I like Starbucks. This one let me down. My bf got me my favorite drink and sandwich as a surprise breakfast. The drink is good. Iced passion tea with apple juice and no sweetener. But the sandwich... Wtf. It's supposed to be a roasted tomato, spinach, & mozzarella panino. It's 90% bread. And although the bread is fine... The sandwich itself is disappointing. I've had better from starbeezy. I would add my own cheese and spinach to it if I could but because we just moved, I don't think I have either anymore. Bummer.

I've been going to this Starbucks for years and have never had a complaint until now. I ordered the vanilla machaito, but I wanted it blended. The girl told me that I couldn't have it that way. Ummm, why not? There's a sign right behind you that says, "Make It You Way", or something like that. So why couldn't I get a blended vanilla machaito? I don't know if the girl was just being lazy or what, and I was on my way to work so I didn't bother to argue this out with her. Instead I ordered a vanilla bean frap with two shots.  I finally got it, after more than five minutes of waiting when there was only one person before me.  I tasted it as I walked out and it was disgustingly sweet.  Too sweet. So not only was I disappointed for the second during this visit, now I'm just annoyed by the whole experience overall. I'm hoping my next visit will be better. I'm giving them one more shot before I head down to the one at Ft Apache and Trop instead.

I went today and Michael was the guy in the drive thru. Did not smile once and gave me a sluggish attitude no matter how cheerful I was to him. If you don't want to work there, don't. Or step it up Michael. People like happy people. ... Another thing; they never apologize or offer any kind of sympathy for making the wrong order.

Unfortunately, as much as I L O V E Starbucks, I can not give this particular one more than two stars. Actually Id like to give it one but thats somewhat contradictory to my love for Starbucks in general. So its a two. And why you might ask.... well I have written another Starbucks accolade here on Yelp and it is in regards to the use of venti or trenta cups for something other than a venti or trenta drink. I love green tea, but have you ever gotten the really dark color one that looks like they made it last night and are now serving it to you today? Tea that is so dark and strong I dont like very much. If I did I would order black instead if green. Anyways, so I always order a grande green tea in a Trenta cup (at my starbucks on Rainbow). However, the Fort Apache Starbucks complained about how expensive the cups are for the Trenta (may I remind you that the refills are 50 cents and I do bring my own cup in most of the time) and told me I could not have a grande in a trenta for this reason. Somehow this doesnt seem logical to me. They want to charge me 2.90 something for water and ice ----- however you can get a trenta sized ice water for free??? excuse me? Nevermind, Rainbow said theyd give it to me in a trenta anytime I want ;)

REVIEW #32:  1 stars  (508 chars)
I will give this FApache location zero star . I use Starbucks 5 times a week,   I went this morning to order toll mocha n baked cake. I requested to make ex ex ex hot, they didn't make hot enough.  I check my receipt when I was waiting my coffee , they charge me grande size which is $1 overcharge . I ask sever but she told me to go cashier, so I need wait another 5 min after I got coffee. Almost I gave up n leave the store he open 2nd register for me.  ... Service is very bad compare to other Starbucks.

REVIEW #33:  1 stars  (831 chars)
I would give this place no stars.  ...  ... Yesterday, I came to order a hot marble mocha machiatto in the morning just before going into work. They repeated my order twice and even said it again when handing me my machiatto. When I got to work, it was completely dark and it read mocha. I just left it sitting for hours and then after my shift, I went back and complained about the mess up. They quickly fixed it and it had tasted great. ...  ... Today, I ordered the same marble mocha machiatto again. It read " white mocha " so I figured it was correct, since sometimes they ring it up like that. I got home and it was completely dark again and tasted just like mocha.  ...  ... Just because they say its the right order, do they even know what exactly they are giving us? I am very disappointed and have just wasted more money.

REVIEW #34:  1 stars  (1257 chars)
I'm writing this bad review on principle. ...  ... We were in the area for DW Bistro and decided to spend our 30-minute wait at Starbucks. I ordered some sort of passion iced tea and then stood aside as I patiently waited. A couple who ordered after me seemed to be good friends with the barista and they got both of their drinks ahead of me. OK not a big deal. But then another customer also received his drink before mine showed up. At that point, I decided to get closer to the counter. Finally, the barista puts down some sort of iced drink in front of me. I didn't catch the name, but it looked like it could be mine, so I grabbed it and took a few sips. At that point, the barista asks the next customer if he was waiting for a drink. It turns out that I had grabbed his. I put it back down and tell her I've been waiting for my drink for a while. She then promptly hands me my iced tea. Where was that 5-10 minutes ago? ...  ... I apologize for the long journey with no payoff. I'm not sure why my drink took so long, but they didn't seem to care and offered no apologies. Similarly, I felt no remorse about taking someone else's drink and forcing them to make him another. ...  ... I also feel no remorse for giving this Starbucks a one-star review.

REVIEW #35:  1 stars  (905 chars)
I've never had my drink orders messed up more often that I do at this particular location.  I'm not ordering complex things either, just simple menu items with either non-fat or soy milk.  But so often I get handed something that's a bit off.   ...  ... They also don't seem to prepare enough pastries in the morning, because 90% of the time by the time I arrive around 9ish the few items that I usually like are long gone.  Whereas every other location still has an ample supply.  So that is pretty annoying. ...  ... Also the drive-thru line's construction is pretty short, thou the line can get so long it winds into the parking lot blocking off the normal traffic flow.  Sucks because this location is the closest one to my house, but with all the mistakes, lack of pastries, and the ridiculous lines, I have been driving a few miles further one direction or another in order to hit a different store.

REVIEW #36:  1 stars  (527 chars)
If I could give zero stars I would!! My husband and I both got food poisoning from this location!!! We both ate breakfast sandwiches and both suffered greatly, to the point that I had to miss work and go to the hospital! We called and got an " I'm ... Sorry" then wrote in and got offered a $20 GC, ( no thanks) and now am waiting on a regional director for further details. It's really awful what there lack of care put us through!!! ...  ... Update: regional offered us another gift certificate to Starbucks.... Um no thanks.

I love Starbucks in general but this is one of my go to places, the staff here is always so nice, expecially Kyle.  Today I'm trying a "new to me" drink. It's a Chai tea latte with soy, no water with vanilla, so creamy, sweet and hot just the way I wanted it. My usual is boring latte with nonfat milk... lol. Today is in the 60s and my yummy drink is exactly what I needed today.

I'm a Starbucks freak, however had had horrible experiences at some locations. But this location is great. I would stop in on the way to church or work. The drive they is always quick and they have never messed up an order. Recently the price they have me for my drink was high, so I questioned them about it. For the inconvenience they gave me my drink for free! Great customer service and the baristas are down to earth! Try this Starbucks out!

REVIEW #7:  4 stars  (2405 chars)
"Kentucky Fried Inbred" ...  ... The following is how I spent my half hour at Starbucks today:  ...  ... "Dat yer car out dare?" ...  ... I looked up from my magazine. Beside me stood a gap-toothed midget hillbilly with hat pulled low and jeans pulled high. I looked out the window. Roughly fifteen vehicles sat parked in the lot. I sighed. This was going to be a long conversation. ...  ... "Which car?" I said. ...  ... "Da Crown Vic! Da blue one!" He pointed excitedly out the window like a four-year-old who'd just seen a bird. ...  ... "Yes," I said, assuming he'd just dented it with a pick-up truck. ...  ... "FER REALS???!!! I HAD A CROWN VIC BEFORE!!!!!"  ...  ... Small world. ...  ... He looked at me with narrowed, trailer park eyes. "Jew a cop?" ...  ... "No," I said. "I'm not a cop." ...  ... He looked relieved. "I don't mean to bodder ya none but did da cops ever pull y'over fer yer license plate?" ...  ... I mentally added an hour to my earlier estimate of a long conversation.  ...  ... "Why would I get pulled over for my license plate?" I asked. ...  ... "'Cuz it's all faded. Don't reflect none at night. I gotta teakit fer mine." ...  ... "No," I said. "I never got a ticket. But I might now since you mentioned it." ...  ... "HAW HAW HAW HAW HAWWWWWW!!!! Din't mean to jinx ya none! HAW HAW ... HAW HAWWWWWW!!!!" ...  ... God, I thought. I must have been a real MF'er in my past life. ...  ... "What year is dat car a yers?" ...  ... "2005," I said. ...  ... "DANG IT ALL!!!! MINE WAS A 2005 TOOOOOOOO!!!!" He cackled uncontrollably. Wiping spittle from his cracked lips he said, "How long ya had it?" ...  ... "I bought it new in 2005." ...  ... "Dat dare's right nice."  ...  ... And with that he walked off to join his pal--a taller, fatter version of himself.  ...  ... I returned my attention to my magazine and coffee, sipping the fine Pikes Place warmth as I read an article about what Mexico's richest man was doing to help the poor. I like this Starbucks because there are plenty of clean, comfortable places to sit, AND the fact it is close to THE 215--the road I take to work. The $2.43 for a venti coffee agrees with me too.  ...  ... Finally, this is my go-to Starbucks because the music is rarely on when I'm there at 6:00 AM. Nothing is worse than loud singing at that hour. Unless, of course, you meet a Kentucky Fried Inbred. ...  ... HAW HAW HAW HAW HAW!!!!!!!!

REVIEW #8:  4 stars  (673 chars)
For me, a Starbucks isn't a proper Starbucks if it doesn't have a drive thru. This Starbucks has a drive thru, and for me that is a big plus. It  also seems to be less busy compared to the others in the area, it's rare for me to see more then one car in line when I am there...  ...  ... On my most recent visit, the employee taking my order didn't hear it correctly,  so when I got to the window, it was the wrong size... Not only did she remake my drink very quickly but she was an absolute sweetheart while she did so.  ...  ... I don't go to Starbucks as much these days as I did in the past, but when I do need a jolt of caffeine, this is one of my favorites to go to.

REVIEW #9:  4 stars  (249 chars)

My regular location before work or to hang out with my friend who lives near by.  It's usually quite and the staff is very friendly.  They have a small corner next to the barista area(?) and that is my favorite spot.  It is near the restroom and I can sit there with my laptop because power outlets are there.

REVIEW #12:  4 stars  (418 chars)
This is probably my favorite Starbucks, location- and service-wise. I've never seen it get too busy, and there is plenty of indoor and outdoor seating. The employees are super cool and nice. They don't waste time getting your drink order to you like some stores do. ...  ... There is nothing outstanding about this Starbucks (some are open 24/7, have rooftop plants or two stories, etc.) but it's an excellent standby.

REVIEW #13:  4 stars  (513 chars)
This Starbucks has some of the nicest baristas of any location I've ever been to.  They've always been very friendly each time I've been.  And they don't lolly-gag and take forever with the orders like you'll find at some locations too.  It's also never super busy at this location, unlike a few of the other locations in the area. ...  ... They offer a drive-thru,ample indoor and outdoor seating, all the drinks and goodies you could possibly want, and great customer service.  That's a complete package for me!

REVIEW #14:  4 stars  (323 chars)
This Starbucks is great! ...  ... Some Key Points that make this location that make it so wonderful: ... 1)  Smiling, helpful, and pleasant staff. ... 2)  Drive-thru, that typically isn't slammed. ... 3)  Clean interior, with tables in the front when the weather is nice. ...  ... As far as Starbucks go, this one is solid.

REVIEW #15:  4 stars  (1510 chars)
Use too come to this location every week on my days off but like too mix things up so been while since got my coffee and read my book (the True Blood series). I never had bad experience at this Starbucks. I know Starbucks is Starbucks so hard too compare between one store too another? At this location whats nice is theres few seats can choose from plus few more outside. Depending on the weather enjoy kicking it outside having my coffee and reading a good book. Sure there not much of a view just the parking lot but if reading good book not about the view. Inside they do have two nice leather seats besides regular tables. They have ample outlets all around too plug in laptops or electronic devices most part right next too the tables. They use too have couple board games in the store could play but no more. =( ...  ... The service is great! I never look at the chalkboard with the holiday special or specials running at the time. They were nice enough too point out that it was buy one get one free at the time. Customer service liked that fact plus their always greet you with warm welcome when place your order.   ...  ... I order the holiday special creme brulee latte. I never had before. Love it! It taste just like creme brulee (without the sugar crust on top) blended nice Hot! They serve pastries, ready made food, different bottle drinks, and all coffee equipment one would need.  ...  ... Always been fan of Starbucks still am always will be. Two grande Starbucks overload for one. Soo good!

We were headed to the Silverton and I looked on Bucky's website to find a new stop.  I'm glad I picked this one.  It's right on the flight path for McCarran and my friends know I'm an airplane nut.  Sitting on the patio sipping my quad iced espresso was heaven watching the planes coming in for a landing at the airport. ...  ... Our drinks were made perfectly and there is a large patio area.  That was good yesterday because someone had the inside thermostat set for keeping meat frozen.  Damn it was cold inside. ...  ... The staff was polite and friendly and it was a good stop.

REVIEW #17:  3 stars  (233 chars)
Friendly folks, good coffee (although they were out of salt for the Salted Caramel Mocha). Plenty of parking & seating... Only gave 3 stars because all the chairs are uncomfortable wooden chairs, no comfy chairs. Otherwise, all good.

REVIEW #18:  3 stars  (829 chars)
I pulled up to the drive thru and the girl greeted me with something like, "Hey how are you doing?" ...followed by a "what do you want?" what the...?? I ordered a tall non fat vanilla latte. I don't think it's hard to mess up on it. The drive thru wait seemed pretty long as there were only two cars in front of me. When I got to the window I asked the girl if it was a non fat vanilla latte and she confirmed yes it was. I drove off taking her word for it but when I took the first sip...UGH totally disgusting and not anything near a vanilla latte. I check to see if there were any stickers or writings on the cup describing the coffee but I didn't find anything. I already drove down a mile and I didn't want to return back to deal with it. Pretty disappointed, should have stuck with the Starbucks on rainbow and warmsprings.

REVIEW #19:  3 stars  (496 chars)
So, drive thru starbacks on a saturday. Freaking circus. ...  ... The woman who takes my order, doesn't even wait for me to pull up to the speaker. The car in front of me is still closer to the speaker than I am. So, I scream my order to her. She informs me that the drink I want is "seasonal" but they can still make it, minus the topping.  ...  ... Drink was blended well, but there is confusion upon pickup. I was asked at the window what I had ordered. I think they are a little disorganized.

REVIEW #20:  3 stars  (260 chars)
They close at 8:30 PM on Friday night, yeaa... ...  ... Drinks are Starbucks consistent, most of the staff were friendly people, but one employee was less than tasteful and definitely irritating. ...  ... Note: drive through is usually fast, never a long line.

REVIEW #21:  2 stars  (413 chars)
I barely come to this Starbucks, but I rather not come to be hit on while getting my drink. And they always mess up my orders and they're not complicated. (Green tea latte w/ soy and hazelnut drizzle or PTL light ice) ...  ... I asked for them to redo my order, they ADDED more ice and they just changed the cup. They did nothing different to my drink. And there is always an attitude when I tell them to redo it.

REVIEW #22:  2 stars  (588 chars)
Rude Barista. ...  ... It's absolutely appalling when a cashier gives you attitude and appears annoyed that you have a large order. This is the only Starbucks where the barista at the cash register- Jessie was her name - actually gave me attitude and was annoyed that I had an $85 order of 6 drinks and breakfast items. Isn't the point of being in business to actually GET business? You'd think you'd be appreciative that businesses (such as mine) were always spending large amounts at your establishment in one order. I'll be going to the Coffee Bean next door from now on. Unbelievable.

REVIEW #25:  1 stars  (1365 chars)
I go to this Starbucks because it's on my way to work. No more. I ordered a trenta green tea sweetened which is what I normally order. A tall male barista with glasses prepared a black tea sweetened and placed it on the bar yelling out that it's a black tea. Seeing that I am the only customer in the store waiting to get a drink, I advise the person at the counter that I ordered a green tea. They take the black tea  from me and the same tall kid made a new drink out of the same container of black liquid that he just declared was black tea. He then put it on the bar but this time he says it's green tea. I taste it and it clearly tastes like black tea.  I then bring it to the attention of the cashier who offered to give me my money back or make a new one and the kid who made the black tea tried to argue with me by telling me it's green tea when the liquid is obviously black and the same smart ass kid made it from the same container which he earlier declared was black tea. He then tried to tell me that they changed tea leaves which is the reason why it's so dark. (I'm assuming this must be the institutionalized BS line to pacify disgruntled customers). What annoys me was there was no manager there to set that turd straight. The cashier was very nice and tried to fix the situation but you can't fix arrogance. I won't be back to that Starbucks ever.

I never used to go to Starbuck's because I don't drink coffee but I started tutoring someone for a class and that is where we would meet. So now I get there on the regular. I usually get the biggest Green Ice Tea Sweeten they carry or the Apple Cinnamon drink..wow nothing better.  ... Yesterday I was working in an office across the street from this location and walk over for my Ice Tea and asked if I can come back for a refill as I had to go back to the office to meet a customer. They Manager said "Sure We Can Do That". I thought that was great customer service! I bounce back two hours later get my refill and they even say "You are back" when I walk in. The small things can make all the difference... By the way the student I tutored got an "A"..

REVIEW #3:  5 stars  (886 chars)
Ok, I LOVE Starbucks! Well, wait- I love it by DEFAULT because before I am a coffee and tea junkie, I am a wi-fi junkie. That said, this chain could easily be my kryptonite, except for the fact that I do some of my best work here! So it's actually more of a safe haven for me. I like the air of familiarity in any of the locations and especially this one. It's got a kind of a funky location. The kind where if it weren't a Starbucks, it would probably be vacant commercial property. Parking is odd, the drive-thru is too, and there's only "one way in & one way out." But I assure you, once you get over those little hurdles, there is a very nice staff that is there to assist you with your favorite thing on the menu! I think all of these things make it my special, cozy, safe haven. Oh, it also seems to be a fun stop for police officers too... which is neither here nor there. Enjoy!

REVIEW #4:  5 stars  (313 chars)
The staff here are amazingly nice.  I watched a disabled customer come in with crutches who they greeted by name and even helped him back out to his car with his ordered.  When my husband spilled his coffee,  not only did they quickly come to clean it up,  they also gave him another drink for free.  Great staff!

REVIEW #7:  4 stars  (458 chars)
Drive thru here is quick. Most of the time they make the drinks great, but sometimes you can tell they're moving at the speed of sound making it cause there's syrup all over the side of the cup. ...  ... The people that work here are great. Sometimes the cashier, the older woman, has a bad day and she's pretty grouchy, but nothing offensive, for me anyway. I'm sure the overweight businessman behind me will bust out off his shirt from her tartness though.

Have you ever been to Starbucks and wondered... Hmmm If only I could order a  half of a gallon of my favorite $5 treat. Well now you can, It is called the Trenta. This monstrosity will have you buzzing all day long, I order a simple Iced Coffee with sugar free vanilla I am definitely not the Venti iced half-skinny half-1 percent, split quad shot (Two poured over the top, other two mixed) with 2 pumps of Carmel, one scoop of vanilla bean powder, stirred, no whip, double cupped guy.  ...  ... This place is always spot on my order since it is quite easy to pour some Pre-made coffee into a cup that is packed full of ice and hand it out the drive thru window with a smile on your face. Starbucks is your modern day crack dealer... Not that we don't have enough of those in Vegas already. Here is to a great Starbucks started Friday morning.

I've stopped at this outlet a few times and I enjoy it quite a bit.  There's a good amount of table space and the wifi is available as it is at all Starbucks. ...  ... The only drawback to this location is its location.  It's a pain to get in and out sometimes because you have to cross traffic on Rainbow Boulevard.  You also have to know to come out a different driveway if you're going north on Rainbow.  Once you know, though, it's OK.

REVIEW #11:  4 stars  (810 chars)
Yes, all Starbucks stores are the same. BUT, I have found that with my signature drink (Trenta Caramel Soy Iced Coffee) there are several things to get wrong. The soy to coffee ratio has to be right and if they pour the soy after the coffee the blend is all off. Also, I have paid several different prices for my drink. Sometimes, its an Iced Coffee with Soy and others it's an Iced Coffee with Milk and there is no extra charge for the soy. This location gets it right every time. I live around the corner and opt to walk the few blocks each morning. The team there has become very familiar very quickly and always gives me a pep in my step to start my day. Everyone is all smiles whenever I come in and are always efficient with the service. When they start remembering my name, I'll give 'em the fifth star.

REVIEW #12:  3 stars  (163 chars)

Been here twice and both times they've failed to understand what non-fat milk means. I'm not calling it a venti skinny blah bah blah, just give me a large non-fat coffee and take my money. ...  ... You bunch of retards. ...  ... I kid. A little. But we need some additional training at this one.

I come here almost everyday before I go to work. The staff is very friendly and the drive thru goes by pretty quick.The only thing which I wasn't too happy about is a staff member here. Every time she makes my drink there is always something wrong with my drink, I don't want to make a complaint about my drink when she's already giving me a hard time taking my order!

REVIEW #15:  3 stars  (542 chars)
I love this location. It is one of the bigger ones and they have a huge outside seating area, with umbrellas for the sun. ...  ... The lady taking our order could have been friendlier.. She could have at least smiled? Usually I just get an iced caramel macchiato, but this time I was hungry. ...  ... I ordered an asiago & cheddar pretzel, which was okay. I also got a cheesecake brownie. I took two bites and threw it away. I've learned that when coming to Starbucks I should just stick to the coffee. The pastries always seem to disappoint.

REVIEW #16:  3 stars  (1144 chars)
Sometimes the drive thru is not the fastest, but often times I am the only car so it's a fifty fifty shot. So if you like to gamble this is the drive thru for you!  ... The same thing has to be said for the cafe... Sometimes they have it together, while other days they don't even know you exists! One day I waited 10 minutes for a Venti 10 pump chai latte and they weren't even busy! I was beginning to think the barista forgot to write my cup out! Come on guys, chai lattes don't get any easier! You don't even have to pull any shots! 10 minutes was a bit ridiculous!  ... I was in there just last night and the young blond barista didn't even acknowledge me with a hello or even a smilie, although she looked at me about three times as I was waiting for someone to come to the counter. I get that she was busy, but all she had to do was acknowledge my presence, not act like her life as a barista was so ruff!  ... 95% of the time I only order a Grande Pike Place anyway, so it's not like I am putting them out, which is their job by the way!  ... Customer service is a MUST with me. I can forgive slow but not rude and thus the three stars.

REVIEW #17:  2 stars  (235 chars)
I ordered a cappuccino! It felt a little light! It was too light. I believe the barista poured a sip into my cup and topped the rest off with foam. Not happy. I guess a few bucks does not go a long way these days. Try harder Starbucks!

They are just always friendly here!! ... I have never waited more than a couple minutes to order and/or be served my drink. ...  ... I like it, you might too...  ...  ... Parking can be tough, as the shopping center is not very well designed, but that is by no means Starbucks' fault. ...  ... I read the bad reviews below and trust me, I have never had a bad experience as described. The employees are often chatty and take a genuine interest in what the customers are talking about. I say this because I frequently talk to strangers and have become involved in intense conversation with other customers and baristas waiting in line here.

This is a spacious coffee house location without a drive thu..  Friendly staff and my order is made right consistently.  Recently added more umbrellas outside which is great but its very hard to move them around so what's the point?  Also, the outdoor tables need to be dusted off more often.  Other than that I have very good experiences. The recent remodelling is an upgrade.  Careful when backing out of the parking spaces as many others will fly in right behind you, seen many close calls. ... FYI this Starbucks is within the city limits of North Las Vegas not Las Vegas itself.  The other side of Decatur is Las Vegas.

The only downside to this joint is that they don't have a drive-thru.  That's the downside if you're in a rush. ...  ... The upside, when you go inside, is that they don't have a drive-thru...so that means that you have a better idea how long the wait will be. ...  ... I go there to work remotely sometimes...so I don't have to do it at home.  I think it's great. It's usually rather quiet because most people are reading or working on laptops, so we're all uber-focused.  I like the barstool tables along the window, and they have outlets all along the window so I can charge up my laptop as I work.  Pretty snazzy. ...  ... Drinks are very good.  As good as any other Starbucks, and the staff is usually friendly.  Even when the line is long, I don't wait as long as I do at other locations, so that's a huge plus (likely because there's no drive-thru)

REVIEW #6:  4 stars  (270 chars)
This location is always busy and usually you will have a short wait.  However staff are always pleasant and friendly, and there white chocolate mocha is perfect!  Due to the traffic this is a great place to people watch and relax on a weekend morning with your beverage.

Wonderful crew, a daily stop of mine

REVIEW #8:  3 stars  (300 chars)
I come here because it's close to my house. No other reason. The staff is super friendly and really know their customers. However service is slow and the quality of drinks are unpredictable. A dirty soy chai might be spot on one day and the next day by the very same person taste absolutely terrible.

REVIEW #9:  3 stars  (342 chars)
Stopped in to grab a cup of joe while doing some early morning errands. Fiona greeted me with a smile and quickly took my order and got my coffee. The new Thanksgiving blend was my bean of choice and it was pretty tasty. I added a piece of cinnamon coffee cake for good measure. The only drawback to this location is the lack of a drive thru.

REVIEW #10:  2 stars  (308 chars)
Compared to other Starbucks in the area, this is one I usually avoid unless I need to get on the freeway right after. Pretty slow service, drinks are mediocre... But what does it for me is that it's never a welcoming experience here and the employees make me want to leave quicker than they can serve coffee!

REVIEW #11:  2 stars  (748 chars)
Honestly, I've had a pretty crapping morning but I still go out with a smile. The cashier who worked here this morning was completely unpleasant. I explained to her that I wanted to try a neopolitan (a drink off of their secret menu) she had no idea what I was talking about and she just gave me the most, "you must be stupid" look. I told her that it would be alright I'll just get my regular. She was so short and cut me off when I was about to explain if I wanted it hot or cold. Luckily she guessed correctly and ordered it cold. I would have given this place 1 star but thankfully the young lady making my drink was the absolute opposite, bubbly and sweet. They need to fix the staffing here because mornings are very important business hours.

REVIEW #12:  2 stars  (947 chars)
I'll give them credit for being in a nice area and decent size place for a Starbucks.  But of course I probably won't come here again, after my experience.   ...  ... The Batista that was at the counter, didn't really seem like being there.  I'm sure it was a long day, but at least still do service with a smile.  Ordering 2 venti ice mocha, one with soy milk.  You would think they would ask if I wanted whip cream with the soy milk.  Now I know other Batista's at other Starbucks actually ask if I want whip cream.  Unfortunately this one didn't.  Being lactose intolerant and having whip cream with my ice mocha, kind of ruins the whole thing.   ...  ... My overall thoughts, if you're not lactose intolerant, this may be a great place to grab a coffee.  But if you are lactose intolerant, make sure you specify no whip cream, if they don't ask.  Which I believe they should cause every other Starbucks I been too were courteous enough to ask.

REVIEW #13:  2 stars  (568 chars)
Probably the longest it's ever taken to get a drip coffee. Simplest order ever, and I'm fine with waiting my turn but every other Starbucks I've ever been in the cashier will just turn around and pour a drop coffee because it takes literally 2 seconds so I don't have I wait for all the 'mocha-frappa-caramel-soy-chai-blended-extrahot-grande-lattes' that take forever to make in front of me. But not this one. It gets 2 stars instead of one for having lots of comfy chair and couch seating, which I only got to sit in for 5 mins after the 25 it took to get the coffee.

REVIEW #14:  2 stars  (289 chars)
The service wasn't bad. Had to ask twice for a receipt. The ladies room was horrendous! Had not been cleaned for some time. No toilet tissue or paper towels. Had to dry hands on the seat covers. The floor needs to be power washed. Obvious no one has really given it the attention it needs.

REVIEW #15:  1 stars  (193 chars)
Just waited 7 minutes for an iced latte even though there was no one in front of me! Chic started talking to her friends and totally forgot about me! Epic fail. I guess my $1 tip wasn't enough.

REVIEW #16:  1 stars  (452 chars)
Ugh! My breaking point has been reached. I said no foam, it's on the cup. I had a quarter of a cup of foam that I had to scoop out! Pay attention. I've been visiting this Starbucks for nearly two years. The drinks are terrible! The lady working the cash register in the morning is so slow, she slows everything down. I've seen other regulars walk out when they see her working. I'm over this location. I'll wait till I get to work to grab a cup of Joe.

This is my "go to" Starbucks and I am usually here at least twice a week. Sarah is a great GM and very personable.  Sadly, John M. no longer works here and has moved on to a new career and greener pastures in CO. ...  ... I agree that this place gets a bit crowded & I have chosen to sit outside on marginal weather days.  There are a dozen or so seats outside with umbrellas for the tables not under the awning/breezeway.  Drinks are consistent though & they know what extra-dry actually means.  ...  ... I have been here right when they open, when it is busy, and just before close and service is fabulous.  What else can you say about the most widely visited coffee chain in the US? ...  ... Starbucks tips: ... 1) Use a registered card in order to get free items for every 12 purchases ... 2) Buy & use a reusable cup (save on the landfills) ... 3) Get to know your barista(s)

REVIEW #2:  4 stars  (419 chars)
Bring a sweater! They keep it coooold in here. I think all Starbucks are cold in order to get you to buy some hot coffee.  This Starbucks was clean, had friendly staff,  and had outlets for me to use- always a plus. Of course, I was lucky they weren't crowed on Saturday afternoon.  There's a nice covered outdoor area to relax and enjoy your purchase as well. If I lived closer, I'd frequent this particular Starbucks.

REVIEW #3:  4 stars  (267 chars)
I stopped here after breakfast this morning following a hike at Mount Charleston.  I've been here numerous times in the past, but today was the first in a fairly long time. ...  ... Service was quick and pleasant.  When I'm in the area, I won't hesitate to come here.

REVIEW #4:  4 stars  (1303 chars)
My biggest issue with this place is that an employee, the GM, is the current Duke of this place!  Unfair, checking into a place you work!  D:   ...  ... ANYWAY, Aside from that grumble - This place has bomb staff.  The GM Sarah and Jon in particular are two powerhouses that remember names, drinks, and current events in their customers lives.  Starting the morning off here is nice as you get a great view of the sun light scraping across the sky and some great conversation.   ...  ... It's also a great location as it's right before you take off down the 95 highway.  I usually stop by here on my way to/from the Tenaya Barkin' Basin Dogpark with my Golden Retrievers, who are very popular with the morning staff.  :) ...  ... But the place is clean, efficient, although small so this is not a great Starbucks to lounge and study in the middle of the day due to how crowded it gets.  One small group of book club or Republican Wives or whatever who meets every so often here just swallows the place whole with a mere twelve people.   ...  ... Also - WiFi is kinda slow here.  I suggest heading East to the Craig in the plaza with the Lowes.  They have a larger Starbucks with a slightly faster WiFi.  Doesn't quite has the warm social aspect of this location, but great to get work and projects done.

REVIEW #5:  4 stars  (485 chars)
My Girl and I have been going to this Starbucks location the last few mornings, I have also been here many times myself and I have to say the staff is great. One man especially stands out and always seems to know many people's names even their children's names.  ...  ... As with any Starbucks the coffee is good and the flavors are all same being that it's a chain, but this location is nice with outside seating, and plenty of seating inside. ...  ... If you are in the area, try it.

Pumpkin Spice Frappuccino! A great day gets better. Came here with my daughter. We both enjoyed really quick and friendly service from the staff. Nothing less than good 'ol starbucks.

REVIEW #7:  4 stars  (469 chars)
This is my favorite Starbucks! I live all the way out on 215 and Trop, but I will drive across town to visit this place! The barristas are out of this world! I've always gotten the same drink, but after spending some time at this Starbucks, I have been encouraged by the associates to venture out. They'll keep making drinks until you are 100% satisfied! I'm always welcomed with a smile and warm hello! I wish it was closer to home, but it's worth the drive everytime!

REVIEW #8:  3 stars  (422 chars)
Hello Starbucks my old friend. It's nice to see that you are still filled with pretentious hipsters toiling away on their MacBooks and baristas who look like they want to be anywhere but where they currently are in life. Aside from the odd mix of depression and shame that comes with a Starbucks franchise the food and coffee is always delicious. I just can't help but troll Starbucks and their silly culture at any point.

REVIEW #9:  2 stars  (1533 chars)
Decided to give this location a try as it is on my way to work, and I drink Starbucks 2x daily. Was disappointed that there was no drive thru but that is no ones fault. I would say that my 2 stars are only for the outcome of my drinks. The rest of my experience was a total service failure. I came here two weeks ago and then again last week. Neither experience was positive. Both times I felt like I was a hassle to both the barista and the woman at the register. Both times, the women taking my order apologized to me because they were carrying on conversations with their coworkers while I was ordering. Is it that hard to focus on a customer for 30 seconds. I wrote this off the first time but twice!? Come on ladies. Additionally, during my second trip no employee made eye contact with me. Not while taking my order nor when handing me my drink. She then apologized for talking to her coworker while not looking at me!  ... I manage a VIP services department in a strip casino, so I deal with guests and customers every day. I know what they're going through but I also would expect to be treated as if I'm not invisible. I'd rather pay the inflated casino prices for my Starbucks and be treated kindly than simply be ignored. Additionally, they were more than happy to chat over the the separator with regular guests. Apparently new customers are not as valuable at this location. I was so angry I took the store mangers card on my way out but decided it just wasn't worth my time. Ill continue to frequent any other location.

Awesome people, service is fast. They have their days when they get slammed, but the service is as good as you'll get from any starbucks from any busy metro in the US (New York, LA, Chicago). The staff is always friendly and makes an effort in getting to know their regulars.  ...  ... Best of all, there's drive thru! Just don't for the lane to be easy for your gas guzzling behemoth.

REVIEW #2:  5 stars  (237 chars)
Friendly, quick, clean, consistent. Everything I look for in Starbucks. The drive-through has always been friendly and helpful and on occasion, hilariously funny (which helps on those mornings when I don't want to drag myself into work).

My Starbucks of Choice.  ... Jericho is my regular drive thru barista. It only took him two days to realize im a reg and start pouring on that Vegas friendliness I have been so blessed to enjoy since I moved here. I told him about how Fort Apache and my old San Diego Starbucks told me no more grande in a trenta even though I show my patronage to the Starbucks most usually 2-4 times a day. He has assured me that Rainbow does it in a Trenta Cup all day long. So.... I'm hooked. Rainbow is my reg starbucks no matter where Im headed.

REVIEW #6:  5 stars  (347 chars)
The staff here are all very upbeat, friendly and professional. The store is clean and well organized. The drinks are consistently good! We always hit this Starbucks on our way out of town. So you can thank these fine baristas for keeping me caffeinated and awake, preventing me from being a menace on the road...well, more of a menace on the road.

REVIEW #7:  5 stars  (449 chars)
This is a GREAT Starbucks. I always use the drive through and I LOVE that you can see the barrista on the camera when you order. Most of the time the barrista is very smiley and happy. Makes ordering through drive through much more personal. I have always had great service. One time my order took a long time and they were proactive to give me a coupon for a future complimentary drink due to the delay. I won't go to any other location in my area.

REVIEW #8:  5 stars  (254 chars)

Great store, my home ... They are the best during the week in the AM. Their weekend team needs to learn from the A-Team but it's still better than some other stores. I mean it's Starbucks after all... Yeah I'll wait.

REVIEW #13:  4 stars  (278 chars)
It is a convenient location for me being that I pass it every time I go anywhere. The staff is very friendly and they do offer free wifi. Always expect the drive thru to be long and timely. So if you're in a rush, definitely set aside some extra time if you intended to stop by.

REVIEW #17:  3 stars  (508 chars)
It is starbucks so you know what to expect from the beverages and food served. I am giving this place a 3 because of the baristas. There was one chick in the window one morning and she was so rude I almost had to walk inside to complain. I saw her again and I had to drive my car around and get out to get a straw for my cold drink because the girl wouldn't come back to the window. I don't really like this location. I only go there if I'm close and don't feel like driving any further for my starbucks fix.

REVIEW #18:  3 stars  (302 chars)
No wonder this place has such a bad rating. The cashier with the non-uniform pink apron has the most sour puss face I've ever seen at a Starbucks. Listen, I have purchased several thousand drinks from Starbucks in my life and I don't think I've ever been served by someone so unpleasant looking. Yikes.

REVIEW #19:  3 stars  (592 chars)
The coffee gets the typical three stars, the service here loses the other stars.  I am a recent transport from CA and maybe its different out here but it takes forever to get your drinks here.  The last time I was in the drive thru there were three cars and it took me 20 minutes to just get to the window to pay and another 5 to get my drink.  I normally go inside in the mornings, there are only one or two other people there and it still takes ten minutes.  Its the closest Starbucks store so I will continue going there but I really think they need to change the management of this store.

REVIEW #20:  3 stars  (795 chars)
Yeah, it's one of your typical Starbies.  And I know there's better coffee out there.  Writing a review on this may be construed as lame.  But there's a reason why it garnered my attention: It's a drive-through! ... Realize the significance and beauty of it: ... Hung over.  Tired.  Unable to stand for long periods of time.  Need caffeine.  Not a problem at the drive-through. ... Starbs:  How may I help you? ... Me: caaaarghhhh ummmmmm ... Starbs: I'm sorry.  Could you repeat that order? ... Me: uuuhhhh oooohhhhhheeee ... Starbs: One more time, sir? ... Me: Coooofffeeee ... Starbs:  Okay, what size? ... SILENCE ... Starbs:  That's okay sir.  Just drive up to the first window. ... SILENCE ... A CAR HONKS ... IT HONKS AGAIN ... I wake up.   ... Me: Coooofffeeee ...  ... Sorry about that.

Drive thru is super slow. No one in front of us had an order more than 2 drinks. They need to get it together. Go to the Starbucks down the street inside the smiths on windmill and rainbow.

REVIEW #22:  2 stars  (926 chars)
I live right down the street from this Starbucks, so I've visited frequently. The speed of the drive through isn't really an issue, but the quality of the drinks I've received the last three times I've been there have been a bit less than satisfactory.  ...  ... I ordered a green tea lemonade that came out to me still warm with three ice cubes floating in it, an iced coffee in which I requested classic syrup with no syrup and not nearly the amount of extra cream requested, and today an iced coffee with the exact same issue.  ...  ... I wasn't able to request correction the first two times, but I did on the third and was met with short attitude, despite me being the last car in line - there wasn't a reason for the rushed tone.  ...  ... The location is convenient, however I will go out of my way to Jones/Badura or Rainbow/Sunset going forward. I suggest the same to avoid a terrible drink that's already overpriced.

REVIEW #23:  2 stars  (204 chars)
Not a very nice group of employees.  I say thank you and they walk away.  Not used to such abrasive employees at a Starbucks.  It might be time for management to review customer service expectations here.

REVIEW #24:  2 stars  (283 chars)
Slowest Starbucks I've been to.... Unfortunate because this one is a convenient location to where I live but the drive through always takes 10-15 minutes whether there's 2 people in line or 12.  People very nice and friendly but not effect enough for how quick Starbucks is elsewhere

REVIEW #25:  2 stars  (2070 chars)
Typical Starbucks... Service and drinks are okay.  Could be better, but could also be worse. ...  ... Reason for the two star rating is the staffs' disregard for health codes regarding animals.  The ONLY reason an animal would be allowed in the restaurant is if it's a service animal.  This morning multiple employees were oooing and ahing a tiny dog brought in by a customer.  This is not the first time I've seen this here.  When I questioned the cashier about it, she told me it was okay as long as it didn't touch the floor.  WRONG.  Cuteness does not justify violating health code.  And before you start to think I'm an animal hater, I have two dogs.  Guess where I do not take them... Any and all restaurants.  Pets should stay home. ...  ... Here is what health code says: ... NAC 446.625  Animals on premises prohibited; exceptions. (NRS 439.150, 439.200, 446.940) ... 1.  Except as otherwise provided in this section, live animals, including birds and turtles, are not allowed on the premises of a food establishment or on adjacent areas under the control of the holder of the permit for the operation of the food establishment. Edible fish or decorative fish in aquariums, shellfish or crustacea on ice or under refrigeration, and shellfish and crustacea in a display tank may be present on the premises of a food establishment if food, equipment, utensils, linens or unwrapped articles designed for a single service or a single use are not contaminated. ... 2.

Always mixing up my order and they aren't friendly about fixing it either. I actually drive farther to avoid this Starbucks even though it's on my way to the freeway. It used to be good but I think the good employees moved on. The Starbucks north of the 215 on Rainbow is way better.

REVIEW #27:  1 stars  (417 chars)
By far worst Starbucks EVER!! waited in the drive thru yesterday for 30mins?!? Really? Only because I couldn't escape from the line. Haha. Then to get my java chip frap that was the worst one I've ever had.. So waisted 30mins of my day to get a drink I couldn't even drink. Thanks but no thanks. I will not return. For being such a huge corporate place. They should have enough people that can do there job correctly.

REVIEW #28:  1 stars  (548 chars)
I absolutely hate that this is the closest Starbucks to my house. It has to be the worst Starbucks in Vegas. Only a handful of the staff are actually pleasant. I've actually seen employees fighting while I'm waiting in line for my coffee, they swear at each other, and are completely rude to customers. Also prepare to wait FOREVER in the drive through line. And they do not care whatsoever if they get your order wrong or you wait for a century. Worst Starbucks in Vegas. I literally drive out of the way to go to the other Starbucks over the 215.

REVIEW #29:  1 stars  (461 chars)
I ALWAYS regret coming to this Starbucks location. I've currently been standing here waiting for my simple iced coffee for 5 minutes and they're not even busy. I only stop here occasionally because it happens to be on my way to run errands.  ...  ... The cream/sugar stand is always unkept and the workers are super rude.  ...  ... Go to the one on Jones (Badura). For real. ...  ... Okay if you must go here go through drive-thru because it seems to be faster.

My daily routine is to drive to Starbucks to work everyday. I usually go to the one on towns center and charleston. I happened to stop by this one 2day and waited 25 min @ the drive thru before I got my drink. Not even an apology or comp drink. Horrible customer service!

Stopped in here with the family and was not happy. I ordered 3 small frappuccinos. The problem that I had was when mine and my son's frappuccino came out they were wrong. Even though we had ordered the same kind we never even put a straw into them. We knew it wasn't right and I told the barrista they were wrong. She acted like I slapped her in the face! She grabbed them up and dumped them out and started over using the same plastic cups she just rinsed out in the damn sink! When she slapped them on the counter my son took his and went to sit outside. I went to get a straw and a napkin to wipe the side of the cup off because in her shitty haste the bitchy barrista didn't care that she slopped my $5.00 drink down the side. To my surprise the cup was actually cracked down the side. So, I go back and show it to the barrista. I swear she looked like she wanted to slap me! She swiftly grabbed the cup up, poured it into another cup, put a lid on it and slammed it on the counter again. ... I will not EVER come back to this Starbucks again!!! Your customer service and shitty attitude assures this!!!!

The worst Starbucks service and most inept employees ever! Yesterday was officially my last visit to this shitty location ever. ...  ... Of course the line inside is out the ass, but I'm fiending so oh well. Many minutes later I finally place my order. But I also wanted to recharge my Starbucks card with $100. It seems like any business would be happy to get $100 these days right. I guess not. The rude ass woman at the register tried to swipe my card once and it didn't go thru. So she says in a very bitch manner "It won't swipe, I don't know what you want me to do with this" and just hands me back the card. Well how about you try a second time. And if that fails too, how about you take 14 seconds to punch the numbers in. You are an employee on the clock right?  ...  ... Well I guess doing her job was just so out of line because she was unwilling to do either one. So no money or business for you. I'll gladly drive to a different location that actually values my money and presence.  ...  ... Which is what I did, I went down the street and got my card recharged. And after complaining to the manager there about what had happened, she apologized and said she'd contact the manager of this store, and then comped me my drink as a token of good will.  ...  ... So with other much better and friendlier locations a mile or so away I will take my business there, and I encourage everyone else to do the same.

REVIEW #38:  1 stars  (544 chars)
These employees appear to be poorly trained and aggressively unfriendly, a deadly combination. ...  ... I would never think to write a review for a Starbucks, because they are so consistent in their quality of beverages and presentation skills.  ...  ... In addition to attitude and demeanor problems of the staff, my beverage and the subsequent refill were both prepared incorrectly, adding to my initial negative impression.   ...  ... The corrections were made, but with an attitude. ...  ... This is the worst Starbucks I have ever been to.

REVIEW #39:  1 stars  (922 chars)
This is CONSISTENTLY the slowest and worst customer service of all the 50+ locations I've been too!! Anyone who follows my checkin's know's I can't start my day without a coffee. I also travel quite a bit for many reason so I have been to more than my fair share of coffee houses around the world. I hate to say it, but the Service at this location would be rated the very worst of them all. The drive thru is ridiculously slow!! There is always at least 2 or 3 cars, and takes about the same amount of time as 6+. The staff ignores you when you walk up to the register half the time while they talk about their weekend or shift or whatever. I could go on and on....  ...  ... But the coffee is still a good Starbucks coffee like I'm used to, there's still free WiFi, it's close to my house and has outdoor seating. So for those reasons I keep coming back. I just know I have to have a lot of extra patience on those days.

REVIEW #40:  1 stars  (1348 chars)
This is, by far, the WORST Corporate Starbucks I've ever been to. The service is horrible, it takes longer than necessary to receive my drinks and everything is always so messy. The only reason why I keep coming back here is the convenience because I live right down the street. ... I work at the Starbucks in the Mandalay Bay next to the House of Blues, and even though it's not a corporate Starbucks, we still hold all the same procedures and values.  ... Whenever I go into this particular Starbucks, it takes forever to be acknowledged if it's not busy. When my order is being taken, they're usually very rude or preoccupied with things other than their actual job- for example they're talking to eachother about their personal lives or how their shift has been going. If I just order one drink it will take around 5 - 10 minutes, depending on how distracted by conversation the baristas are. If I need milk from the condiment bar, it's usually expired already or there is no milk at all. ... Forget it if I'm going through the drive thru. I have about three different rewards accumulated on my Starbucks cards because when I let them know that I have a reward, I just get ignored and they charge me the full price anyway. ... Long story short, the workers give off a nasty, snarky attitude and they take forever to make the simplest of things.

This location is just a faux SB, it's run by the supermarket it's located in and you can tell.  THey don't take SB gift cards and the staff is rude and make terrible drinks.

REVIEW #42:  1 stars  (905 chars)
This was the worst experience I have ever had in a Starbucks. Very unfriendly staff.  First Starbucks I felt that everyone had an attitude.  The cashier took my order and didn't even smile or thanked me after I ordered. I paid with my rechargeable Starbucks card and asked to see if I had any load in there. She just threw my other card that had zero balance without even asking if I wanted to reload it. Handed me my receipt and walked away without telling me that she got my order or thank you. To top it off, I ordered a donut and didn't give it to me until I asked for it 10mins later. The crew memeber didn't even apologize for forgetting to give me my order as if that's ok to just go ahead and give it to me without any explanation or at least apologize for the mistake or delay.  They need to change the crew inside that Starbucks. I would now have 2nd thoughts going in that particular Starbucks.

REVIEW #43:  1 stars  (575 chars)
Worst service at any Starbucks I've ever been to. I try to avoid coming to this location at all costs, but it's the closest to me and sometimes I think the service just might be better this next time. Every time I order a cooked good item, every time, I wait for over ten minutes and have to remind them that I ordered it. They have 10 people working behind the counter and it is the slowest service ever! And my drink, absolutely garbage compared to every other Starbucks, including the ones inside the grocery stores. Amazing how this place is allowed to operate like this.

REVIEW #44:  1 stars  (704 chars)
Wow this place is in need of some customer service training. I came in on a Saturday night a little past 8pm and had a 3 drink orders and a request for a coffee travel pack. Now I usually order travel packs and know it takes 15-20 min to set up if you don't call ahead. Well the guy at the counter says you can't order travel packs because those have to be called ahead of time. I was like really? Well I'll wait and he proceeded to sigh, grin, roll his eyes...clearly not wanting to do the work.  So I told him to cancel the order and went down the street with no problems. I've never had this happen to me before since I've been going to Starbucks for several years and disappointed by this experience.

The coffee is always a great afternoon help! The staff is very friendly.

REVIEW #2:  5 stars  (864 chars)
This Starbucks is the closest one to my work so it's super convenient. Of course, the drive-thru is perfect for me since I'm usually running down here to get a drink on my down-time or my lunch break. ...  ... Been inside as well and the place is typically clean, not super busy. The manager has left his business card out on the area where there are creamers/sugars, so props to that person for being up-front to your customers. ...  ... Also, my car once stalled in the drive-thru here and the barista working the window was kind enough to actually come out and push my car into the parking lot. Of course, I guess he was kind of obligated to since my car would be impeding the drive-thru had he not. But, very nice individual working there for sure. ...  ... Overall, no complaints and I've never received a weird/funky drink here either, so definitely 5 Stars.

REVIEW #3:  5 stars  (369 chars)
This Starbucks is very close to work so very convenient. I absolutely adore this English lady with her even more adorable English accent!!! I love it when she takes my order. Every once in a great while I get a drink that's not mine but they offer a replacement and if I want a free one for next time. Friendly, clean and great service. "Can't get that with satellite!"

I've been to this Starbuck's several times but didn't realize no one had ever entered it on Yelp. ...  ... The staff here has always been pleasant and competent.  There's a lot of room for working inside and the patio has some tables for sitting out when the temperatures permit.  The free wifi is always welcome! ...  ... When I'm in the area, this is where I stop.

This is the starbucks that is on my way to work.  They have never gotten my order wrong, even if I went off the rails.  The staff is super friendly.  I like the girl with the glitter blue eye liner.  She always takes the time to chat while we are waiting for my coffee in the drive thru.   ...  ... Generally, I think management has done an excellent job with hiring!

REVIEW #8:  3 stars  (640 chars)
Being a full-time grad student, I frequent coffee houses frequently. This Starbucks was pleasant enough overall, but the lady taking my order had the personality of a lima bean. This location should put heir friendly staff as the first point of contact and leave the grumpy smurfs behind the counter, where they can make some coffee magic and not have to interact with humans.  ...  ... Also, the place was relatively empty, yet not one of the three ladies behind the counter thought to take a broom to the place. Not very clean and no effort to correct that.  ...  ... Our breakfast and coffees were delicious, though. No complaints there!

REVIEW #9:  3 stars  (1184 chars)
How apropos my 100th official review on Yelp is a Stabucks, as I live and breathe by the caffeniated wonder known as joe, java, mud, brew or other fancy nickname of your choosing. I used to frequent this location so it is very familiar to me. The service here is like the Katy Perry song "Hot and Cold" and I'm not talking about the temperature of your favorite beverage. One visit is outstanding, the next is mediocre. This location is ultra convenient if you are headed for the freeway, as it is located near Rancho and Bonanza with easy access to both the 15 and the 95. My latest visit found me waiting in the drive-thru for what seemed like an eternity with only four cars ahead of me. Granted, some of the delay could have been attributed to those in front of me trying to figure out exactly what it is they want or describing for the poor soul working the drive-thru what their favorite beverage consist of. In the end, the drink was to my liking and the service was more friendly than not. Nothing to jump up down over, just your basic run of the mill Starbucks saga with a bit of a wait. I'm quite sure my next visit to this location will be hot, as this one was rather cold.

REVIEW #11:  2 stars  (428 chars)
2 stars for being sooooo slow! Yes the staff are nice but being the 6th person in line , and waiting 15 minutes to order my drink?! That is crazy! Even the drive threw is slow! I almost went crazy a few days ago, because one of the girls decided to have a full conversation with the customer and her life!  ...   ... I've been to this location 3 times already and all 3 have been a wait time of 20 minutes! Who waits that long?!

Excellent service, quick coffeeaking, and our coffees/pastries were perfectly made.  For our first morning in Vegas (and the Elara), we will be making this our ritual while here!

REVIEW #2:  5 stars  (1035 chars)
This "hidden" Starbucks is located at the Elara Hilton Grand Vacations hotel. However, I stumbled on it by finding an entrance in a far corner of Planet Hollywood's Miracle Mile Shops (to find it in Miracle Mile, look for and follow the Elara signs). ...  ... From first glance this Starbucks caught me eye; it's visually stunning.  The walls on both sides are all glass, floor to ceiling, it just grabs you and makes you want to take a closer look.  Inside, the other all glass wall faces the beautiful Elara pool environs, a calming sight for caffeine contemplation.  The glass front and rear walls make for an arresting see-through effect. ...  ... Another bonus: this site shares a contiguous space with an Elara bar.  When I was there on a weekday morning, the bar was closed, but all the bar seating was available for spillover Starbucks seating!  Also, according to the Starbucks website, this Starbucks is open 24 hours. ...  ... Hard to beat an attractive, always open Starbucks - it's worth the extra effort tracking it down.

REVIEW #3:  4 stars  (693 chars)
I really hate to give any Starbucks lower than 5 stars but this gets a 4 for the high prices and the fact that they gave the person in line in front of me a discount because he was staying at the hotel. Also I am ultra sensitive to the taste of soy or bad milk for that matter, and my grande caramel macchiato, that I drink daily, was slightly off.  ...  ... However, my hubby's whole milk vanilla latte was perfect, and this is probably one of the best places to people watch (and I don't mean facing out to the pool, although you might enjoy that too). ...  ... There are so many Starbucks near here, I think this will be my last time at this one unless I find myself in need of a quick fix.

REVIEW #4:  4 stars  (1826 chars)
i still like to refer to this location as the PH Westgate Towers, but this place is one of the new additions since the Hilton changing of the guards that i really enjoyed.  ...  ... i absolutely must start every morning with coffee. an iced coffee. from Starbucks. call it marketing, call it conditioning, whatever. many times before, whenever i'd come to vegas, i'd always stay at the Westgate Towers (see pending review as to why) and unfortunately i would have to get my morning started with a very below-average iced coffee prepared at one of the side bars near the front desk, close to where this Starbucks location now stands. it was severely over-priced, and was basically just front loaded with a gang of creamer and vanilla syrup. ...  ... the location of this Starbucks is perfect. whether you're staying at the hotel or just cruising through the Miracle Mile shops, this shop is sitting in prime real estate. it's floor-to-ceiling windows on both sides make it look very inviting, and the inside is laid out like a people watcher's dream: you can sip your morning latte or cappuccino while sitting at one of their desks which are adorned with modern (and comfy) chairs or relax on one of their faux-leather armchairs off to the side. that plot of land transitions seamlessly from hotel front desk and lobby area, to hotel bar, to Starbucks. and the automatic sliding window-doors is the outlet onto the Miracle Mile shops. ...  ... it's a serene feeling to be able to sit and enjoy your drink inside while looking at the hustle and bustle of shoppers passing through the shops outside, and then to look through the facing ceiling-to-floor windows which look at the Westgate's mini beach club: a sea of poolside beach chairs, large swimming pool, jacuzzis, and bar areas, and canopied day beds. ...  ... -civilities.

REVIEW #5:  2 stars  (648 chars)
Located in the Elara Hilton Grand Vacations hotel where I was staying, I decided to grab my normal cup of fancy coffee that I usually get.  The line was pretty long and it did take a while to get my drink b/c of that but I am an addict so I will wait!  As someone else mentioned, this Starbucks is extremely pricey!  Boy was there some sticker shock for me!  What normally costs me about $4 at another hotel near where I live was now $5.41.    If this was the price I had to pay every morning, I think my addiction may just go away.   I had no problems with the customer service and found them friendly.  I just wish my coffee was not so expensive!

REVIEW #6:  1 stars  (2039 chars)
Most expensive Starbucks in the nation?? Store is located inside Elara Hilton Grand Vacations hotel and by the Miracle Mile Shops. ...  ... I normally don't complain about costs if I get mediocre service. I just don't come back.  I believe this store is capturing all the tourists who is vacationing so they are willing to spend the extra costs. ...  ... I'm a huge Starbucks fan however this was about my experience at this store.  Starbucks should be wise to see who should be in front of their registers.  I understand some of these stores can get very busy and stressed.   ...  ... This time though very easy late morning, no lines, (hmm I wonder why) my wife and I decided to stop by to get a cup of coffee.  I paid $10 for a tall decaf coffee and a skinny latte.  I thought it was a little high however the very young girl in front of the register seemed agitated when I asked about the price.  I then promptly took out my phone to scan my starbucks card and all of a sudden she sarcastically puts a smile on her face and says 'We don't accept those here'.  I said oh ok how about my rewards coupon I received from starbucks?  Again, she gives this big smile bobbin her head and said, ' We don't accept that either'!   ...  ... She was very happy to say NO to us.  A little more respect for your customers goes a long way.  I never thought Starbucks hired 12 year old's.  Maybe this is a new trend? Maybe it's because they didn't have decaf and she knew she had to do a pour-over (which requires manual labor)?  Which I know many store employee's sulk when I ask for a pour-over.  Not sure why when I do tip them every time... some say thank you.. some just... "Whatever"! ...  ... I think some of these stores seriously need to look into adding iPad's at the registers so that we can order ourselves without the sarcasm's or any frustrations.  I believe Starbucks customers who spends the extra dough for a cup a joe deserves a better experience.  As for me, this is a store I'm not interested in coming back to pay the extra dough.

Good location, always clean, and drinks are made well pretty much every time. Because of the location, the wait can be awhile during "rush hour", but they are pretty good about getting through the line as fast as they can. They don't always have some of the products (mugs, tumblers, etc.) you're looking for and might be a lil moody around closing time, but overall I still like this location!

REVIEW #13:  4 stars  (262 chars)
Good place. I like to go here sometimes to work and study. It's a Starbucks, so much is the same as the others. Though, nice layout and seating despite being small. I like it. Great service and fast. If you come enough, they recognize you and know what you want.

REVIEW #14:  4 stars  (702 chars)
I came here this morning for a meeting. The place is a little hidden, so I passed it the first time, but as long as you know it's in the same plaza as the Chevron, you'll be good. The line was pretty long when we walked in (one lady even walked out), but it actually went by pretty fast. I really only had to wait a few minutes. The staff were very nice and fast with their service. The place doesn't have too many tables that seat more than two people, so we ended up sitting at the couch area with a small table in the corner. I definitely plan on coming here again soon. It's a great central meeting spot for when I have to meet someone living on the East side, since I live all the way in the West.

REVIEW #16:  4 stars  (815 chars)
If you want a laid-back Starbuck's in the Southeast valley, I recommend this cafe. Everytime I hang out here, I never wait on a line or table. The music is Starbuck's radio playing at just the right volume. The atmosphere is the opposite of the nearby hyper-jumping Eastern at I-215 Starbuck's. Whenever I am exhausted I'll hang out here. I leave the cafe more relaxed. ...    This Starbucks with drive-thru service is convenient to travellers along I-215, Windmill Road, and Maryland Parkway. However it blends in with a relatively vacant shopping center and Chevron along Maryland Parkway just south of Windmill, making it hard to see. ...    Overall if you want a laid-back Starbucks experience in the Southeast valley, or are in the vicinity of I-215, Maryland Parkway, or Windmill, this is a one I recommemend.

REVIEW #17:  4 stars  (386 chars)
On a road trip 1300 miles from home and having had hit and miss experiences at indie coffee joints across 4 states (and counting), I admit the uniformity of a chain coffee shop was deeply appreciated.  ...  ... This particular location offered winning service, plenty of wall outlets for laptops, and a damn fine decaf mocha. Perfect except for the A/C--you could've hung meat in there!

REVIEW #18:  4 stars  (474 chars)
The Only reason I'm giving this Starbucks a "4 Star" is Because Of the employee who helped me. "Haley" was the first Starbucks employee here who actually tried to understand my order and made it right. (My drink is very easy) a grande java chip frap with 5 pumps of frap roast and easy ice. I know not hard at all but no matter which Starbucks I go to it is never made right. TERRIBLE!!! She took my order, made my Drink and was super Friendly!!! Thanks Haley! Your Awesome.

This particular Starbucks is superb in customer service in the Drive-Thru and inside the cafe. The location is also great since it's near the freeway.  ...  ... I was in town visiting and didn't want to go to my "original" Starbucks because of the busy parking lot, However I guess since Verizon closed down, this lot isn't as busy.

REVIEW #22:  3 stars  (446 chars)
It's Starbucks. Chances are you've had it, so I won't go into details about how amazing my Passion Tea tasted. I frequent this location, as it is located conveniently off of the 215.  The service is friendly and fast most days. I will caution you to avoid the drive-thru if you see more than 7 cars. I have waited 20+ minutes on more than one occasion. If it's backed up, I usually head two blocks down to Grouchy John's. Really good alternative.

REVIEW #23:  3 stars  (654 chars)
ive been going to this starbucks 3-4 ams a week for the last 2 years and 8 times out of 10 they mess the order up. this coming from a girl that orders the same thing every time. its either the wrong milk (which i use soy) or it vanilla not mocha or the wrong size. its a busy location but its so frustrating esp when you go through the drive thru and dont think to taste it until you drive off. then again shame on me after all this time. thats another thing, the drive thru. if youre in a rush in the am the drive thru is always a good 8-10 min wait. if it wasnt on my way to work and i wasnt addicted i prob would never go to this location. sorry guys.

REVIEW #24:  1 stars  (404 chars)
I admit, I have a coffee addiction and I frequent Starbucks daily.  I recently started going to this store when my job moved to this side of town. I only went here for a week because I almost always received the most unfriendly service at this store. There are a couple baristas here that are amazing, but the attitude from others is enough for me to have started going to the Warm Springs and 215 store.

REVIEW #25:  1 stars  (655 chars)
Okay, I love Starbucks and am a gold card member.. But this location is my absolute least favorite.. Which totally stinks since it's the closest to my house. The drive thru wait is always forever long. They mess up my order more times than they get it right. I was just there, went inside, long line and they were not putting names on orders. This caused a cluster of drinks and confusion at the pickup window. I'm pretty sure I got the wrong drink and it tastes terrible. That or they messed up my order again. I'm making the switch to Grouchy Johns which is just as close. I'll save my Starbucks fix for the location by my work which is always on point.

REVIEW #26:  1 stars  (692 chars)
Terrible customer service!! ...  ... I came in on a Monday afternoon (April 15th, 2013 at 2:30 PM) and was not greeted as I walked in. I brushed it off and stepped up to order. The three employees behind the counter continued their conversation instead of assisting me even after I made eye contact and a smile. One of them even said good-bye to another employee that just started walking into his peripheral vision instead of helping a customer who has been in his line of sight the whole time. I looked at my phone and I had been standing there for about 4 minutes, with no one saying a word or offering me assistance. ...  ... I ended up walking out, what kind of BS establishment is this?

This Starbucks is near my workplace so I'm always here. The staff is always friendly, the quality is always where it should be, and the service is very prompt and accurate. Most Starbucks around the city can get rather packed but this one isn't that bad. 90% of the time I find a place to sit and play with my iPad. The manager, Adam, is very attentive to what's going on in his store and when something doesn't go the customer's way, he will try fix it so the customer leaves happy. I'll keep coming to this Starbucks for a looong time for my good ol' green tea latte's. PS. I asked my Lovely girlfriend out at this special coffee shop.

Generally friendly baristas and pretty generous with the "extra whip".  Drinks are made well for the most part, not weighing too much on the occasionally watery chai tea. They are pretty quick, even during a rush, but once in awhile they give me the wrong kind of scone. Overall though, they get it right, make it tasty, and are always smiling. *thumbs up*

Hilarious drive thru girls. They were making party line jokes and cracked us up.  Refreshing when tired road tripping. ...  ...

I visit this location almost every single day, and have noticed over the last few weeks they have really picked up the pace.

It's a Starbucks...what more can I say about it???  I got their Shaken Ice Tea with the passion fruit.  Very tasty.  It's a really good summer drink.

I would normally give Starbuck's 5 stars, I mean c'mon, it's Starbucks. But this location REALLY needs to work on its "Food with beverage" system. TWICE now they've made me late for work because they got me my coffee but forgot my goddamn croissant. They ask if you want it warmed up, and I always say yes. Usually takes just a couple minutes. Once I sat in the drive-thru for 10 minutes while they tried to find it and then had to make a new one. I'm sure the 6 cars behind me LOVED that. I mean WTF, people. It's a goddamn croissant, stick it in the oven for a minute and hand it over, or if that's too difficult just put it in a bag and I'll microwave it at work. ...  ... I'm fuming as I write this because I HATE being late for work. The line today for both drive-thru and inside were at least 10 people deep. I ordered regular coffee instead of a latte because I knew it would take forever. Got the croissant as a last-minute whim (What? I love croissants and having it stare at me from the case while I waited to place an order made it impossible to resist) and he asked if I wanted it warm. I asked how long, and he said just a minute. So I got my regular coffee and went over to put cream in it thinking I'm making good time. 5 minutes go by, I'm starting to pace because now I have to rush to work. Another 5 and then the people after me with 3 kids gets their breakfast sandwiches. WHAT THE $*%&. The guy goes, are you waiting for something? I said, YES a croissant for like 10 minutes. I'm in a  goddamn hurry. JESUS. I see him go back there and stick it in the oven for 15 seconds and stick it in a bag and bring it over, which just PISSES me off even more KNOWING I've been wasting 10 minutes for a stupid effing croissant. ...  ... I get to work 2 minutes late. Granted that doesn't seem like a big deal to most people but that's not the case for where I work. Late is late and it is NOT okay. $&*(^#%#*(&^$* EFF YOU Starbucks for the shitty start to my day!

REVIEW #21:  3 stars  (327 chars)
I'm waiting for my drink but I can't believe this location is full of flies! At around 2pm on a Monday not even crazy busy, this Starbucks location was a bit messy attracting flies. So if your planning to sit down and enjoy a cup of your fav beverage be ware of company!  ...  ... Other than that. Ok beverages! It's Starbucks.

REVIEW #22:  3 stars  (521 chars)
I've been here maybe twice since living on this side of town.  I've never been a huge Starbucks person even though I spent half of my life in Seattle lol oh well.  I got .10 off for bringing my own coffee cup, but I like just paying a flat .99 for a refill where I usually go.  There's not much I can elaborate on since I'm more of the house coffee type or black coffee in general without all the loaded sugars and syrups, but I will indulge every once in awhile.  Ooops back to my review..it's in a good location for me.

REVIEW #23:  3 stars  (208 chars)
Ok service. This store is still obviously confused by the corporate mandated changes in their internal process. There was a line the whole time. The service was rushed and I couldn't say that it was friendly.

REVIEW #24:  3 stars  (391 chars)
Ran in here with my friend right before closing so she could use their free wi-fi. We didn't buy anything and they practically swept us out so overall I can only base it on my 5 minute experience and it was satisfactory. I'm not a fan of any Starbucks but it was nice that they were open late and let us sit in there using their wi-fi without buying anything...or maybe they didn't notice =/

REVIEW #25:  3 stars  (113 chars)
Starbucks is Starbucks.  Place was clean and my drink was made correctly.  Stopped by because is was next to CVS.

REVIEW #26:  2 stars  (201 chars)
SLOWEST STARBUCKS EVER. I can't stand that this is the closest location to my house. I'm a former partner so I totally understand lines and wait times and I always end up waiting for way too long here.

REVIEW #27:  2 stars  (496 chars)
Well i try to avoid this starbucks at all possible but its the one closest to my house so i dont really have a choice.  ...  ... I will say that morning crew is better than the evening crew. Esp going thru the drive thru.  ...  ... I say this because this past evening there was an episode where they took soo long with the order that alot of ppl were also complaining. granted there was only 3 ppl working from what i saw. Shouldnt Starbuck know how to staff ppl at appropriate hours of the day?

REVIEW #28:  1 stars  (315 chars)
Fourth visit and fourth time they get my order wrong.  I can't wait to use up this gift card.  Expressso seems so weak, almost watered down.  Light ice here must mean 3/4 cup filled.   I'm about to give this gift card away.  One star for at least the server smiles and apologizes for the numerous mistakes they make

REVIEW #29:  1 stars  (689 chars)
I always give this Starbucks the benefit of the doubt! Its my go-to when I need to go to work but today I stopped by on my day off around 8:30AM. The drive thru's are always ridiculously long (up to 15 min wait sometimes) so I decided to order inside. I order a grande light white mocha/hot and they give me a small mocha frappe. Mistakes happen sure- but they made it seem like it was my fault they messed up. Plus not one of the 5 people working there today  apologize for the length of time I had been waiting. Once the barista gave me my correct drink, I said Thank You and barely even looked at me. Way to go on your customer service Starbucks. Never ever going to this location EVER!

REVIEW #30:  1 stars  (676 chars)
I went there today to order the green tea latte. I got it recommend by my friends. The taste is pretty good, but I don't like the customer service. It was the worst one ever. The guy who took my order his name is Louie. My husband ask " can I have a green tea latte" and he said " green tea frappuccino?" Then I told my husband that I think it not that kind, because I wasn't sure it's the right flavor. Then he said "ok thank you, I wait for you at the window" I was so surprise. We haven't finished the order yet, and he didn't ask the size for my drink. Later, we gotta pay for the large one. It piss me off. Such a bad customer service here. I never gonna come back again.

REVIEW #31:  1 stars  (960 chars)
Nothing bugs me more than paying for an expensive coffee and it not being made right!!! I gave this Starbucks more than 3 chances and they failed me.  I just moved to Vegas and I was happy to see a drive thru Starbucks right up the street but I now drive the extra mile up the road to the walkin Starbucks, because this place is HORRIBLE.  ... MY drink had tasted like straight sugar even when I ask for extra Coffee.  When I called the first time to explain that I wanted a replacement the manager insisted I bring the drink back even if I go the next day. WHAAAAT? ummm ridiculous!!!  Bring the same drink back a day later???? Yes!!! Crazy. My wait in line is always 15 minutes or more.  ... And when I get to the window they are not friendly or welcoming, never say hello just ask for the total.  ... Oh and they always look very social inside. Maybe they should focus on making a proper drink!!! I would rather have McDonalds coffee then go here again!!!!!

REVIEW #32:  1 stars  (323 chars)
The worse drive through ever. If you want to wait 20 mins in line come here. I can see this maybe happening here and there. But out of 8 times I've been here only one time in which  I did not have to wait less then 5 mins. Just got to the screen 14 mins after waiting. So another 5 mins and hopefully I will be out of here.

REVIEW #33:  1 stars  (479 chars)
This is by far the WORST Starbucks that I kno of... I've never sat in a line so long before just got a coffee.... I was in line for over 20 mins a few times and they never say thanks for waiting how may I take your order they just go straight into ordering.. So I said when I approached the window what's the hold up...?? And the guy said well we only have three people working..... If it's busy then just hire more people you kno???? My gosh it's horrible horrible horrible.....

REVIEW #34:  1 stars  (316 chars)
Why do I even bother coming back here? Their green tea latte tastes gritty from the  powder they refuse to blend. Keep forgetting that this is the one location I have to order a chai latte instead since they have no clue on how to blend the free tea latte. Seriously if you can't make it right, take it off the menu.

REVIEW #2:  5 stars  (271 chars)
I have frequented this Starbucks for five years, as it is the closest one to where I work.  They are always polite and fun and they deal well with the fact that my "preferred" drink changes by the day.  I actually tip at this Starbucks!  (Wow, I sound like a cheap turd.)

REVIEW #3:  4 stars  (389 chars)
I love caffeine and you are sure to find a Starbucks within a mile of any location in this town. The lattes are good I recommend the White Mocha with one pump raspberry, pumpkin latte, or the white peppermint mocha. The reason they don't get five stars is the prices are ridiculous and the beans always taste overcooked, Illy and Lavazza have smoother tasting beans if that matters to you.

REVIEW #4:  4 stars  (188 chars)
I love this Starbucks simply because it is easy off, and easy on the 95 as I head to work or downtown. They have always given me my order fast and accurate. Love the Pumpkin Spice Frapps!!

REVIEW #5:  4 stars  (235 chars)
I stopped in here yesterday because I was in the area.  The staff was absolutely the best!  Great service and good beverage.   ...  ... This is off my normal path by quite a bit, and I was glad I made the stop here for my daily coffee.

REVIEW #6:  4 stars  (500 chars)
I usually go through the drive thru, but if there is a huge line, I will go inside. The drive thru service is nice. Staff quite friendly. When you go inside, they are not quite as friendly. Kinda odd since its the same people. I suppose it is easier to be friendly over an intercom than in person? Other than that this is your typical Starbucks. Parking near the store is tight. My only real gripe is they have a limited food menu since most of the items are gone unless you are there in the morning.

REVIEW #7:  4 stars  (720 chars)
I visit this location every morning before I go to work. The drive Thur is usually nuts, but I don't mind going inside because the line moves quickly, if there even is a line inside. The staff is always nice and friendly too which is a must!  ... I have to say that I am not really a fan of the new remodel though. If you are looking to sit  down at a table with a friend the new layout doesn't really allow for that. Although it does look very similar to the original Starbucks on Pike Street in Seattle, maybe that's what they were going for, a retro coffee house vibe.  ... Either way I love this location and I am thankful they are there for my morning coffee before work and my treats on the weekends! Yay for Sbux!

REVIEW #8:  4 stars  (272 chars)
Its starbucks, I dont even know what to say about it that hasn't been said.  ... I like this location because its mad close to my house and beyond the early morning super crunch they usually have a pretty quick easy breezy drive through! ... Staff is nice... i'll be back!

REVIEW #9:  4 stars  (432 chars)
Service has gotten a lot better and more consistent the last couple months I've been by here. It's still the most convenient Starbucks for me since it's right around the corner from my house, so I come here a lot. Would defnitely still recommend going inside because the drive thru line here is always out of control. Either way, once you order, your drink should come out pretty fast...the issue is just waiting your turn to order!

REVIEW #10:  4 stars  (102 chars)
This location had friendly staff on this visit! Had plenty of seating and still had comfortable chairs

REVIEW #11:  2 stars  (1537 chars)
Normally I would give this location 4 stars, however, they've really gone downhill the last few times I visited since something has gone wrong with my order each time. I frequent this location all time time since it's right down the street from my house, so it's easy to hit it up on the way to work. If you go inside it's usually empty since everyone piles up in the drive thru in the mornings. If you wait in the drive thru line you might have to wait behind 5-6 cars, sometimes more! ...  ... I am a regular at Starbucks so of course I have gold status. However at this location they frequently forget when you tell them you're redeeming a drink reward and I have gotten charged the last few times even after telling them that I was trying to redeem my free drink. They also seem to have a lot of employee turnover here because there has been someone different at the register lately and some of them don't know what they're doing. Today after ordering a breakfast sandwich, I sat down for 10-15 min and never had my name called. I went back to the cashier to inquire about my sandwich, telling them I never got it and all he said was "really? what kind was it again?" Then 2 min later I magically got my sandwich with no apologies or acknowledgement that I had been waiting forever and was now running late for work. ...  ... In the future I will try to frequent other Starbucks locations instead of this one, but this one is just too close to my house to avoid. Hopefully they begin training their staff better and fix these issues.

REVIEW #12:  2 stars  (1340 chars)
Went in with the Mrs. while doing the weekend thing and was disappointed they didn't have any pumpkin spice. The kicker here is the reason we were given. We were told that they would not have anymore until next year because pumpkin spice was only for the fall and it was now winter. What? Where did they get their calendar? The seasonally challenged clerk then asked the Mrs. what "other" holiday drinks she liked. If pumpkin spice is only for the fall and they stop offering it prior to Thanksgiving because it is now "winter", what "holiday" was she referring to? Halloween? Labor Day? I have been to numerous Starbucks since this visit and they ALL were able to proudly offer pumpkin spice. Even Mickey D's is offering pumpkin spice now. It is obviously a favorite flavor of many and in high demand. How can the mother of all coffee places drop the ball and not have pumpkin spice at the ready the week leading up to Thanksgiving? The poor clerk was obviously just trying to cover somebody's ordering blunder with her feable attempt at explaining why they did not have any pumpkin spice, but made herself look a little foolish in the process. I will, however, be back, as it is Starbucks and I love my cup of joe. The Mrs. will have to find a new location, though, until next year when this location gets a new shipment of pumpkin spice.

5 stars for service!  Read on : ...  ... So we were walking in the Outlet mall with a friend.  I DON'T drink coffee at all...so you can see why I stay away from Starbucks in general...not much for me to see or do here LOL. ...  ... But my friend wanted some coffee, so I obliged.  I was looking at the menu behind her, and she offered to buy me something.  I kindly said no to my friend...but the cashier overheard us and INSISTED I try something.  I told him I don't drink coffee, only a little tea, but that I just didn't need anything.  He took the initiative, and said he was going to make me a Passion Fruit Tazo Tea or some crap like that.  He didn't charge us...just made us a drink lol! ...  ... It was good, and of course I threw in a few bucks for tip on the principal alone.  But the effort was what made the impression....Great service!

LOVE this Starbucks! After having gone to MULTIPLE locations on the strip and having my Starbucks Double shot made incorrectly every time, coming to this location and having my drink not only just made correctly but made very fuhreakin well; I'm in heaven. Oh yeah and the 2 baristas working were very interactive and friendly, which made it twice as nice. Nothing like your favorite drink made great with a side of friendly conversation.

REVIEW #4:  5 stars  (209 chars)
this is a popular place.  We came here after a day of shopping and freezing our butts off.  Hot chocolate is perfect for days like this.  lots of places to sit but it's very busy. Not exactly a place to relax.

REVIEW #5:  4 stars  (840 chars)
Everyone and their mom has been to a Starbucks. They have coffee, tea, snacks and other miscellaneous coffee accessories. And for that reason, I will not be reviewing their products. This is strictly on their service. They are located in the center of the outlets. No matter what time of day it is, there is ALWAYS a line that wraps around. They see a lot customers, especially all the tourists!!! Language is a huge barrier at times and it can be difficult to understand orders. The employees here have always been so friendly. They are all calm and composed, even with their 20 cups lined up with drinks to make. They are fast, which I appreciate since I only have a short time to grab my drink (grande vanilla iced coffee with a splash of nonfat milk) before heading back to work. And hats off to the cashiers who spell MARIE correctly!!

REVIEW #6:  4 stars  (230 chars)
good Starbucks, busy because it's inside the outlet mall. (i should know, i work in a Starbucks inside a mall) ... i had a very light lunch, which was just the egg salad sandwich and iced caramel macchiato.  ... good job partners!

REVIEW #7:  4 stars  (306 chars)
If you get to the outlet too early, stop here for a drink. This place gets crowded during the day, but its a "real" starbucks not a fake one at the casino... so you can use your card, get points, and not pay over inflated casino prices. ...  ... Staff are pretty friendly, and they try their best to hurry.

REVIEW #9:  4 stars  (655 chars)
This has to be one of the busiest ones in a mall setting, in the city. The line is always super long. It's always crowded in here. This place makes bank. Great location, I suppose, right across from the food court (just ok). ...  ... We've probably been to this one the most, together. We usually split a Mocha Chip Frap if we need a little pick-me-up. I don't usually drink coffee (or soda for that matter), but I am a regular tea drinker. So by splitting it, I don't feel as if I am bouncing off the walls. Service is pretty good considering how busy this place is- feels like bumper to bumper. Clean. Lots of seating but like I said, it's a busy place.

REVIEW #10:  4 stars  (445 chars)
You gotta hand it to them. The constant line of people snaking through this Starbucks in day could probably wrap around the Earth. And they manage it. ...  ... Located inside the always busy (I'm groping through my mental thesaurus for a word that's busy x10... frenetic? insect-like infestation?) Premium Outlets, this Starbucks handles enormous crowds with a reasonable wait given the givens and very few errors. ...  ... Plus the a/c is boss.

REVIEW #11:  4 stars  (336 chars)
You had to know I would rock out the Starbucks visits in Vegas too and in combination with Outlet shopping, now you're saying my name! ...  ... Great Starbucks with friendly barista's and my drink was made perfectly just how I like it.  What more could I ask for.  Some caffeine and I'm good to go. ...  ... Love my Bucks wherever I go.

REVIEW #12:  3 stars  (452 chars)
I will start with the fact that waiting 20 minutes for any sort of coffee is not worth it when you are spoiled with the Las Vegas environment. ...  ... It is worth it if you prefer getting an ice water with any of your Starbucks orders though. Be sure to order water when you are here. Dehydration, exhaustion, and soreness occurs when you are in an outdoor mall! ...  ... Expect long waits, possible mistakes on custom orders, and no tables to sit at.

REVIEW #13:  3 stars  (502 chars)
Since this Starbucks is located in the busy Premium Outlets, expect long wait times...both in line to place your order and when waiting for your drink. The dining area is also always super packed as well and there is nowhere to sit. This is a coffee shop where you need to grab your drinks and go. The baristas are friendly and patient, even though they're probably running around, making drinks like maniacs. I only come here when I really need a coffee/drink while at the mall, which isn't very often

REVIEW #14:  2 stars  (524 chars)
The line is always long, but they are staffed well to deal with the overabundance of out of towners. The people who are working behind the bar are friendly, but I am sure they are all singing the same song about their annoying patrons once they get home. Although entertaining, save your job and do not place it on Youtube. ...  ... I tend to stick to an Iced Americano. Instead of cold water, espresso, and ice, hot water was added. It melted the ice too quickly. The coffee was strong enough preserve a bold flavor though.

REVIEW #8:  5 stars  (1086 chars)
Provided the Yelp gods don't strike me down for reviewing a Starbucks I will always view this Starbucks as the model for what they all should be. Friendly, fast, accurate and masters of the bean-inspired beverage.  ...  ... Trust me when I say I go to Starbucks a lot. Every day. My day is screwy if I don't visit one of these glorious kingdoms of coffee. This location is just great at what they do. A high traffic area they probably see hundreds of customers every morning and still remember my drink, even when I'm just talking to a speaker at the drive thru! Go inside and it's like watching a well oiled machine. Don't let the lines scare you because these people know you have somewhere to be, even if it is their couches a few feet away. I'm not going to bore you with the choices cause everyone has been to a Starbucks (venti iced coffee with 4 pumps toffee nut and whipped cream for me, a-thank you) but I think the fact they're so busy keeps their coffee fresh and great tasting.  ...  ... As a self proclaimed Starbucks addict, this is the absolute best one to feed my beast.

REVIEW #9:  5 stars  (973 chars)
There's nothing better than a staff that remembers a regular's name and drink....this staff has it down... ...  ... Not that that's critical but it is one of those extra touches that customers appreciate.  It makes it painful to go to other locations with lesser quality employees.  I've found that some Starbucks have either the smiling faced, happy to give you your fix staff, or the ultra granola that smirks at your because you aren't driving a Prius and destroying the earth. ...  ... This one is full of the smiling staff and extremely friendly and helpful.  They get SLAMMED at the drive-thru more than any other Starbucks or business I've ever seen.  Sometimes when it gets so bad they surprise you after a looong wait with an apology and FREE DRINK.  Without prompting they say, "sorry for the wait, it's on us today!"...No complaining needed they just get that you were waiting too long and make sure you leave with a smile. ...  ... See ya guys 5 times a day!!!!

REVIEW #10:  5 stars  (196 chars)

Best location! The baristas are great and they really go out of their way to remember my name and my order. They are super fast and for the most part you can be in and out in 5 minutes.

REVIEW #15:  4 stars  (896 chars)
I know others have been a little harsh on this location.  I have to say I like it though.  I have to confess that I do not drink coffee but I get hot chocolate and tea here.   ...  ... The biggest cons of this place is the cleanliness.  It is sometimes a little dirty but normally there are not a lot of people on staff and with the shop being open 24 hours a day it is hard to get the place super clean. Also being in the same shopping center with a bunch of other restaurants and Las Vegas Fitness Club it can be a real pain to turn left into the shopping center. ...  ... The upside to this place if the atmosphere.  I like the general chatter and coziness of the place.  I like to come here and work on school work or write reviews for Yelp.  :D  It is pretty easy to get to a plug to keep my computer running and I can get a drink and/or a snack when I am starting to digress  from homework.

REVIEW #16:  4 stars  (587 chars)
I love how this place has a 24 hr drive through window. I haven't had a problem with the service, in fact the people were so nice that when I brought my dog with me...they offered him a doggie treat!  They're not that fast, but they get the job done.   ...  ... The only bad thing I really dislike is the location.  It's a little far from home, and right off a busy freeway.  The traffic getting into here and out is a hassle.  In fact getting through the drive through is a hassle.  I wish they'd move down near Silverado and Eastern.  Possibly in the Silverado Plaza?Just a suggestion.

REVIEW #17:  4 stars  (242 chars)
I love starbucks.  I  know it is so corporate and blah blah but the drinks really are great.  I can always count on my drink tasting the same (unless I maybe go to a grocery store one).  Other cofffee shops just don't typically taste as good.

I needed a caffeine fix and this was right off the freeway.  I had noticed this location once when I was a passenger in a car and could look around and enjoy.  I filed away in my brain the location so I could stop here when I needed to. ...  ... The need arose yesterday.  I had hiked a little under four miles and this was a good place to stop for my daily Starbucks. ...  ... I did not use the drive through.  The line was long.  Instead I parked in front and went inside.  The workers were very friendly and competent. I was in and out in no time at all and right back on the freeway heading to Summerlin.

REVIEW #19:  4 stars  (631 chars)
My car thermometer said it was 38 degrees this morning when I was headed to work, and I was in the mood for a quick caffeine pick-me-up. Thank you coffee gods for giving this Starbucks a drive thru!  ...  ... There is usually a line of 2-5 cars when I stop here before work but the people working always seem to get people on their way quickly. I have never gotten the wrong drink and most of the time they don't even charge me for the extra drizzle of caramel I request!  ...  ... I have never stepped foot inside, so no comments on the cleanliness, or lack thereof. All I know is on cold mornings, that drive-thru is a lifesaver!

REVIEW #20:  4 stars  (608 chars)
No doubt one of the better Starbucks in town for a couple reasons. ...  ... 1. its super convenient - located right off the 215. ... 2. drive thru! ... 3. open 24/7 one of the few in Vegas and the only one on the south side. ... 4. newly expanded -  double the size! more space for studying and hanging out ...  ... Keep in mind that this location does get packed. Even with the new expanded area it can still be tough to find a spot camp in during peak hours. The coffee is like any other Starbucks location and the drive-thru is pretty quick. Perfect spot for late night study sessions or just hanging out.

REVIEW #22:  4 stars  (840 chars)
Some mornings, this place is absolutely amazing.  Other mornings, it's really off.  When I go in the afternoons, I receive good, solid service.  So most of the time, it's the bee's knees. ...  ... Protip: If you're going for your morning coffee before work, the earlier the better (as if I really had to tell you that).  I actually work fairly early (7am start) so even when I stop by here around 6:30-6:40, it's pretty unpredictable.  One morning I was in and out very quickly, another it took them almost 15 minutes to get through, oh, 3-4 cars. ...  ... Drink orders are always spot on, so nothing to complain about here.  Drive-Thru PLUS 24 hours PLUS down the street?  Yeah, I'm kind of a sucker for it. ...  ... Just beware the mass of students and hipsters with their laptops!  I usually order to-go so I'm not a stickler on seating.

Starbucks....What can I say about starbucks....For the taste...I guess its alright.  I happen to like quite a few other places over it for taste but by the same token, I gave this place four stars for the following reasons... ...  ...       **********************  Pro's ******************* ... 1) Open 24 hours ...  ... 2) Always makes my drink right even though I have pretty complicated taste buds (2-3 shots of expresso over ice, 3 pumps of toffee nut and 1 pump of sugar free hazelnut all over ice) The good thing is if you have a registered card, they don't charge you for the flavor.  Since I ask for two different flavors, they could very well charge me for one but they never do.  ... You also get one free refill if you order Ice coffee, regular coffee or their passion ice tea. Can't beat that now can you? ...  ... 3) Close to my saigon 8 which has awesome vietnamese food for vegas, yogurtland to quench my frozen yogurt urges and right off the freeway. ...  ...   **********  Now for the con's :(  ********* ... 1) Way too cold all the time, I leave a blanket, and a sweater in the car just in case i head here to study. ...   ... 2) The music is way loud.  Even with awesome earplugs, I can hear the music clearly....no bueno. ...  ... 3) The seats are super uncomfy.  I have a seat cushion in the car if i come here. ( Hardcore studier here! )  Hence, I sometimes opt for the Trop and Decatur location even though I live on the outskirts of henderson, takes me 40 mins to get there...They have booth seating and its not going to cause me frostbite toes. :) ...  ...    All in all though...great place for students to study late night, just make sure to bring earplugs and a sweater.

REVIEW #24:  4 stars  (757 chars)
THE BEST PART OF WAKING UP..... IS HAVING STARBUCKS IN YOUR CUP.... ...  ... This place never fails me. This particular location is located off of eastern and 215 near the LVAC gym. Its 24 hours that's what I love about this Starbucks and it also has free wifi.. I love to go here to chat with freinds and use as a meeting point.. I also love studying here since it's just down the road from my house.. Also I love people watching here when im tryinging to kill time i see some interesting stuff.. for example I witness a internet meet up.. too bad the girl was not interested in the guy... also witnessed a guy trying to pick up a girl at the Starbucks. Haha can you tell I get so bored easily.. Go to this Starbucks you'll see some intersting crap... LOL!

REVIEW #25:  4 stars  (276 chars)
They have a drive-thru thus...automatic 4 stars. I am not hard to please when it comes to Starbucks, as I only ever order one thing: a treinta black iced coffee. I know that doesn't make me a connoisseur of S'bucks so take my review for what it's worth. Now where's my coffee?

REVIEW #26:  4 stars  (1577 chars)
This is a Starbuck's that never sleeps. It is the 24 Hour Starbuck's serving the Southeast Valley. ...  ...     This is my go-to Starbuck's very late at night or very early in the morning. When I suffer from insomnia or I work very early shifts, I come here for my caffeine fix. This Starbuck's is testimony that there is nightlife at Starbuck's. For crying out loud, at three in the morning it is happening.   ...  ...   When I come here in the very early morning I feel safe. There is plenty of protection. Ordinarily, I will be sharing the place with Metro, the Henderson Police, or the Nevada Highway Patrol. ...  ...   In the peak hours, Starbuck's mania lives at this location. When I visit this location in the late afternoon, it is ordinarily full to capacity to the degree that there will be a wait for a table. It is common to see Starbuck's customers waiting with a cup of coffee to get a table. I am one of them. This Starbuck's fills up with an eclectic group of people that include people leaving the Las Vegas Athletic Club, friends meeting up, business people, and people working on their lap tops.  ...  ...   As far as customer service, it has usually been good. At three in the morning I do not expect four star customer service. I am glad that there is a Starbuck's open. Because this location is hyper busy there is less interaction between barista and customer than a slower Starbuck's at Valle Verde at Paseo Verde would have. ...  ...  As long as this is the 24 hour Starbuck's serving the southeast Valley I will return. Especially when I cannot sleep.

REVIEW #27:  4 stars  (860 chars)
This Starbucks is just really useful for the tired, overworked, and wired. People like us NEED this place! We need a place to sit down, relax, and continue to work. This Starbucks is like my home. I use it to study for exams because it has a big seating area and it's open 24/7. However, even though I need coffee to get through life, I wouldn't say Sbux serves the absolute best coffee. They also have the worst coffee shop food in general! Everything I eat is always stale or odd tasting. But, man, is getting frappes and sweet drinks here addictive!! I just can't get enough of it!!!  ...  ... Some of my favorite drinks include: Java Chip (my everyday drink), Shaken Iced Passion Tea Sweetened (my diet drink haha), and Caramel Apple Spice (my feel good drink on a cold night).  ...  ... Oh, make no mistake, you'll definitely catch me here at finals week!

REVIEW #28:  4 stars  (915 chars)
This Starbucks is pretty awesome! It's located right near my gym and is my go to place whenever I need a quick pick me up. ...  ... The biggest benefit that this Starbucks has compared to most others is that it is almost open 24/7. I can't remember correctly if it's either Sunday and Monday, or Monday and Tuesday, but during one of those couple of days every week, during 1am-4am, they are closed to do a deep cleaning of the store. I appreciate that so that it doesn't turn into a complete sh*tshow! ...  ... Another great benefit is that this Starbucks is HUGE! It's not your typical small intimate coffee shop. This place is large... and in charge!! (like Charles - Scott Baio) ((not the Fonz, but still pretty good)) ...  ... Great location, great hours, convenient, clean, the employees seem well trained. Can't really find any faults with this one. Way to go! (But I save the 5-stars for the local spots ;p)

REVIEW #29:  4 stars  (624 chars)
You know a place is a great place when you go and there is hardly any place to sit other than the floor. You may have to wait a minute or two (don't count and or quote me) to get a table, but it is well worth it. The staff has been exceptionally kind and friendly, always willing to please. That alone should gain your business. The staff is friendly, knowledgeable, helpful and FAST. I usually go around the afternoon to the early evening and there is a bit of people, but I never have to wait long to get a table. I love that it's 24 hours, and the later I've stayed the friendlier the staff seemed to get. A+ in my books!

REVIEW #30:  3 stars  (834 chars)
I avoid this Starbucks as often as I can. The only reason for the visits to this locations is because they are open 24/7. ...  ... No matter what time of day it is, the place is always packed with people on their computers "working." Some of them may be legitimately working, but a lot of them are just hanging out. It's hard to find a spot to just sit for a minute and enjoy a drink. Only tables that are open would be the ones outside, and that's because it's either freezing or a million degrees. I didn't know this was your own personal office to sit for hours and stare at your computer screen. What happened to studying at home or at the library? Maybe I'm just old school.  ...  ... Anyway, the drinks are always good and the employees are nice and efficient. The drive through does take a while so I suggest just going inside.

REVIEW #31:  3 stars  (721 chars)
I hate that it is located on Eastern. It's such a busy street and always have traffic. I just want to get a frappe without getting frustrated bad drivers.. on top of that, their parking lot is always full.  ... If you happen to go to this and want to get your Starbucks fast, do not go through the drive through. I repeat do not go through the drive through! The line may seem short and more convenient, but honestly it takes twice as long than the line inside (from my experience).  ...  ... I really enjoy that this Starbucks is 24 hours  and that they expanded the building. They have comfortable seating and a very clean environment(probably the cleanest). One thing for sure is no matter the time, this place is busy

REVIEW #32:  3 stars  (1895 chars)
I've been to this one Starbucks before (drive-thru) and it was good but I am so annoyed with my service today. I went there around 11:30pm because I was craving an iced caramel macchiato after work and because I wanted to see the activity so I could maybe make it my new "local" Starbucks as it's open 24/7, even though it's a bit farther than 2 other ones. It was packed and with good energy. The one guy at the register looked like he definitely didn't want to be there though. I know you've probably had a rough day but as a customer we don't know, so give everyone your best service and always flash a smile. It's simple, be nice. As I told him my first drink order he started to walk away. As I started saying the rest of my order he looked upset and kept on walking while taking my order. As he was always looking down I decided to keep my order simple. He took forever to type my order and I had to slide my card 4 times like wtf. He then proceeded to make the drinks of the other people that ordered AFTER me! I had just ordered a simple tall hot caramel macchiato and a venti iced caramel macchiato! After I got my drinks I asked for a cup holder because I don't have one in my car. He sighed and basically tossed me the cup holder tray, he wasn't even a foot away! All this time I was nice and calm trying not to say anything so I just rushed out of there to try and control myself as I didn't want to start complaining about service. As I get in my car and taste my iced macchiato, it's very milky. I could not taste any coffee at all. My moms drink was warm, not hot. I like to taste my coffee! If I had wanted a glass of milk, I could have just gone home. I didn't go back to complain because I knew if I did I would just get angry and start a scene which I didn't want to do as I might want to go back, but if that guy is there again, I'm asking someone else to take/make my order.

REVIEW #33:  3 stars  (242 chars)
It's a 'bucks.  ...  ... We're talking about coffee here, and with S'Bucks for me, it's always over priced for what you get, however once in awhile, you get really good service. That's what I'm commenting on today. The service was impeccable.

REVIEW #34:  3 stars  (982 chars)
Ok it's a Starbucks. I happen to actually like Starbucks. I love how its unpopular to say you like bux but they somehow sell more coffee than anybody else. Either more people like bux than will admit it, or people love drinking coffee they hate :-) ...  ... This particular location has lots of pros and a couple cons. ... Pros: 24hrs, drive thru, located right off the freeway and next to lvac. ...  ... Cons: either understaffed or undertrained but place is not always clean. Place is also often crowded.  ...  ... On a final personal note. I am a Starbucks Gold customer. I come here 5 days a week minimum and usually at the same time and order the same thing at the counter. Been doing this for a couple years. You would think with my name printed on the card that one time in two years, somebody would greet me by name when I come up to the register. Not the end of the world but certainly indicative of a stores training and management. Come on guys I'm a big fan, step it up!

REVIEW #35:  3 stars  (708 chars)
This is the only 24-hour Starbucks in the immediate area.  Considering the coffee chain's ubiquitous nature, I'm talking a radius of just a couple of miles.  That said, this place is a bit larger than most strip-mall variety Starbucks you'll find in Vegas and is part of a commercial center that features Las Vegas Athletic Club, some office buildings and a recently added Yogurtland.  Come here any night and you'll find it packed with students with laptops up, books open and headphones on.  There's plenty of tables outside too if you want to feel the warm air in the summertime.  Drink quality is as uniform as you'll get at a Starbucks, which is nothing to write home about.  I usually get a Chai Latte.

REVIEW #36:  2 stars  (604 chars)
24 hours. YES.  ...  ... That is my only favorite thing about this place.  ... Oh, and drive-thru of course... ...  ... But, for a chain.... for an INTERNATIONAL chain, I expect consistency on my $4 drinks, which I do not get here.  ...  ... Bookies and students take up this place, and it is hard to find a seat whether you are meeting up with a friend or coming here to study. It is just too crowded.  ...  ... Another thing, the smell of old espresso lingers in this store and sticks to my hair and clothes.. ick. The only thing that keeps me coming back is its convenient hours for my night owl ways.

REVIEW #37:  2 stars  (698 chars)
I am not a fan of masking the taste of coffees or teas with cream and sugar. Give me my caffeine straight up, hot or cold. The convenience of having a Starbucks on every corner allows for easy accessibility, but I want taste. I like teas that take more effort than to remove from a pre-packed bag and steep. No Japanese tea ceremony needed, but something more than what I can do at home is appreciated. ...  ... The employees are nice and it breaks my heart to bash on businesses with good customer service, but I just don't see anything beyond convenience with Starbucks.  ...  ... The small Pike's Place coffee is a good deal, at two dollars, for someone who just wants something basic and quick.

REVIEW #38:  2 stars  (147 chars)
Possibly the slowest drive-thru I have been to, even when there is no wait. I wish they would work on this since it is the closest one to my house.

REVIEW #39:  2 stars  (350 chars)
The Mocha Fraps I get at this location are usually great, but the last Mocha Frap I got tasted like a bitter, slushy, plant soil flavored drink topped with whip cream. Ive Never tasted something so yucky that's suppose to be so sweet and creamy. One good note, on the exchange not only did they make it right they bumped my drink to a larger size. =)

REVIEW #40:  2 stars  (398 chars)
Two stars for being open 24 hours and conveniently located.  Besides that, I have never been to another starbucks that consistently screws up my drink. How can you screw up an iced coffee with toffee nut syrup? I keep giving them chances and they keep screwing it up every time, I don't get it.  These people need some training in not only making drinks but also listening to what is being ordered!

REVIEW #41:  2 stars  (282 chars)
Yeah their drinks are good but the long line I ALWAYS have to wait in makes me not want ever get Starbucks or give them my money. I understand they're busy and often receive large orders but they need more staff to be working because I'm over waiting 15 minutes to get a frappucino.

REVIEW #43:  1 stars  (1002 chars)
Deserves no stars today! I went through the drive-thru as usual and ordered a grande hot mocha extra hot and a piece of lemon pound cake. Traffic is really bad due to the time if day, so I was setting in traffic when I tasted the Mocha and literally tried it a couple times hoping I was wrong the first time. The mocha tasted like hot water with milk! No flavor what so ever! I fought traffic to return and went inside. Stood in line for about 10 minutes and told the guy at the register what had happened and he looks at me and said okaaay....like what do you want? I told him I had to fight traffic to return and he just looked at me. He told the barista I said it tasted like water and they made me a new one. I took one taste and the same exact thing! WATER! Are you kidding me! They offered no other alternative, like maybe a drink he actually knew how to make?!?! Now I'm fighting traffic to go to another Starbucks and pay a second time just to get a descent drink! This is totally unacceptable!

REVIEW #44:  1 stars  (729 chars)
During graveyard shift I stopped in for a cup of Joe and a bite to eat. The cashier was absolutely the worst person I've ever encountered at a Starbucks. She just looked at me with death in her eyes until I asked her if I could order something.  She was not delighted that she had to get out of her chair to heat up my sandwich.  She limps over to the toaster puts my food in then proceeds to throw away trash using her bare hands to push it down. Gets better...after handling the trash she doesn't wash her hands and uses them to take my food out of the oven!! Wtf! Then she tosses my food on the counter and says "there ya go". ..um hello did I break your ankle? How about taking the night off so you don't ruin other people's!

REVIEW #45:  1 stars  (2016 chars)
First off, I would like to say that I will NEVER return to this Starbucks location... I don't care if it's the last cup of coffee on this green earth.  ...  ... There was no line so I walked past (while smiling, of course) a girl just leaning on a portion of the counter chatting with the girl running the register. There was a guy behind the counter being fidgety and seemed upset. He was doing what I remember doing when I was 5... slamming things down in an uproar, gritting his teeth and just BRINGING DOWN the entire mood. Naturally, I was instantly put off. The girl running the register greeted me with an annoyed, fake smile... but a smile none the less. I smiled back and asked her how her day was. She looks at me and stops everything she was doing to stare at me in horror and proceeds to make a disgusted face. Now, allow me to explain what she was looking at... I have an oral piercing called a smiley. I know this is considered odd and not a lot of people know how to 'handle' it but I am a person none the less and when I am a patron, I expect to be treated as such. This girl was an adult and there was no reason for her to make such ridiculous faces at me no matter what she thinks... to me, it's the same as being visibly racist while at work... how many people do you know that would let THAT fly?  ...  ... Anyway, she turns to a girl on the same side of the counter as me (what I can only assume was an off duty employee that I'd walked by on my way in) and just blinks twice before sticking her tongue out in a gaging motion. The girl behind me replies with "Yeah, that's what I'm saying". Let me add that I was still standing between them while this conversation was taking place.  ...  ... When I find myself in places like these... I feel like a grumpy old man thinking to myself "What is WRONG with people these days"?  ...  ... If I had a cup of coffee in my hand when I walked in, I probably would have turned it upside-down over her head.  ...  ... ...and I'm normally a happy person. =)

Ordered a grande white chocolate mocha in the drive through, come home and come to notice that they only filled my cup half way with coffee. Very upset I paid 5$ for a grande but received the amount of a tall.

Rant Alert!! ...  ... Ok I am a huge Starbucks fan and a loyal customer. I love my home store and this is not about them. I am not usually one to complain, however, now I have to. So listen up because today was just ridiculous...... again.  ...  ... Every Saturday is the same nightmare at this Starbucks store. Not just once in a while, but every time I have been in there. My gym, LVAC, is located there and I go on Saturday mornings for Zumba and afterwards I get a Greek yogurt with honey and granola. This store just finished construction making it 2 or 3 times as big as it was. But I ask you WHY? Management is inept and unable to lead or schedule shifts and has never been able to staff this store correctly. There is always a long, looooooong wait. Not necessarily because of a long line either. There are never enough people working EVER at any time that I have been in there over the past 3 or more years. It pisses me off when I see one person behind the counter taking orders and then fulfilling the orders. That means, if the customer at the register orders five sandwiches, heated, with five drinks and a pound of coffee ground finely please, you're screwed for a good 10 minutes. That's absurd! That's money lost! Bar-backs people! There should be two people behind the counter at all times that do nothing but fulfill orders. PERIOD. This location needs to send in secret shoppers to see just how much money this store is losing because of poor staffing and management. Hand over fist I tell you! There is no sense of urgency to sell and this team does not work together. People going on breaks when there are 10 people in line is bad management, bad scheduling and bad for business.  ...  ... Someone needs to get upper management involved toute suite. Or ask me, a dedicated customer, how to streamline your operation to work for ME. You heard me.........

REVIEW #48:  1 stars  (594 chars)
The management at this store must REALLY be struggling!  It's all about training, recipe's, and cleanliness folks!   ...  ... This is a very busy location, and in the heart of the morning they only have one cashier...and that individual does not understand how to work with the POS system.  Then the drink was done to taste weak and gross...how difficult is it to make a chai tea latte...its a mix!?  On top of that...they were out of napkins and other essentials, and all the areas to prep coffee or sit down were filthy dirty.  ...  ... I need a new coffee option by my work! Any suggestions?

REVIEW #2:  5 stars  (1127 chars)
Located on the corner of Sahara & Fort Apache, in the Albertson's anchored shopping center, next door to Baskin Robbins, this has become my go-to Starbucks in the morning on my way to work. ...    ... The staff is amazing!  Since I come here almost every morning, they know my drink without hesitation.  I appreciate when they recognize regulars.  They are all really nice too! ...  ... I will say, there are some days when a certain group of barista's are working and its much slower than another group.  Sometimes certain people work better with others or sometimes it may be the delegation of duties.  Either way, I have figured out how to time it so I hopefully don't wait very long. ...  ... The parking lot can get super busy in the morning.  If you drive-by and all the spots right in front are taken- keep driving.  That means they are pretty busy. ...  ... Wish there was a drive-thru, but that doesn't stop me from getting my iced, venti, caramel macchiato with extra caramel.  And sometimes I make it a quad, depending on how tired I am. :) ...  ... Thanks for starting my morning off with a smile and some caffeine!

I would go to this location on a daily basis for a little over a year when my daughter was going to Kinder Care, which is right up the street, and every morning would be a pleasant experience!  ...

One morning, I even asked them to make me over a dozen Frapuccino's for  the ladies at my daughter's preschool and they knocked it out of the park!! They even went as far as helping me to my car with my drink order.  ... With all of the normal perks such as free  Wi-Fi, indoor & outdoor seating, and a great drink/food selection you're also getting great customer service and a pleasant atmosphere here! This Starbucks location in particular is definitely one of my top three. ... Here's to you Starbucks crew @ Sahara & Ft. Apache!! -B

Stopped in this starbucks for a quick cup of coffee. As I was getting out of my car ran into an acquaintance. When we were at the register he asked for a cup of pike to which they were out of it. So he said he would take a blonde. The clerk provided it without charge.  ...  ... You never expect local service from large chain companies but I was very impressed with how she immediately recognized she wasn't able to meet the customers original need and didn't hesitate to ensure the customer left satisfied without the customer having to request it. ...  ... I know the gentleman gets his coffee there daily but I will make sure when I'm in the area this will be the starbucks I shop at.

I've been to this location a number of times, but the convenience of getting in and out makes this less than the most desirable location. ...  ... Service has always been very good. ...  ...

It certainly isn't my Starbucks of choice, but it's A-OK.

This version of the Green Mermaid is in the Albertson strip mall, nestled in the labyrinth of side roads just off West Sahara avenue, high on the hill overlooking Las Vegas.  ...  ... It's a different , presumably newer store design. There are none of those cone-shaped, tortoise shell colored hanging lamps over the barrista bar. ... No oval shaped drink pick-up platform. It has a more straight-forward, rectangular shaped set of store furnishings, like you would find anywhere in a suburban strip mall. Well, I guess that is what this is.   ...  ... Pretty small space, limited parking. A lot of regular customers, greeted with friendly customer service from the staff that recognizes the regulars. ...  ... It is sort of cumbersome getting into and out of this place from West Sahara though. If you don't know where it is, you will easily pass by it a couple of times, even with a GPS in your car.  ...  ... If you are planning to meet someone here, give yourself extra time, unless you're a regular.

I absolutely LOVE coffee. I know, I know artificial sweeteners are bad for you... But my body craves the caffeine.

Let me tell you.. receiving great customer service with a smile is one of the best ways to start your day. I was once thanked with a complimentary Cake Pop. It was really good! Thank you for always delivering great drinks, food, and customer service! I got my gold star status here last year and I'm going to continue purchasing more drinks here as well!

REVIEW #7:  5 stars  (324 chars)
I've been coming to this Starbucks for over a decade now. It's the same great service I receive every time I come here. Nice chill place to hang out, to do Ur homework, some networking or just to catch up on some reading. Baristas are always happy & friendly. I like the drive thru, it's pretty consistent on the wait times.

My normal Starbucks when I am on my way the Henderson Area.

REVIEW #9:  5 stars  (299 chars)
This is not my usual Starbucks but the one closest to my house was close due to a water issue.  I stopped by here for my iced americano and to do a little work for the up coming week.  Temperature of the cafe was pleasant, music was at a good volume, the baristas were nice and my drink was perfect.

REVIEW #10:  5 stars  (335 chars)
This Starbucks is one of my favorites. The staff member that took my order was paitent and took the time to assist me with a few coffee related questions, my drink was made correctly and per my order, and the store was clean.  ...  ... Note, this store isnt usually packed full of customers, which is nice when you need to find a seat.

REVIEW #12:  4 stars  (124 chars)
Good service, quick and friendly for the most part! 4 starts only because the drive through at this location is never quick.

REVIEW #13:  4 stars  (548 chars)
I love this location for the drive-thru in the morning.   The baristas even know to put the stopper in for me now (which tells you how much I stop by). ...  ... The only problem I have with this location is that the drive-thru is sometimes very slow.   I'm not sure if baristas can't keep up with the orders or what, but it slows to a crawl at times which is unusual since most other drive-thrus I've been around the country don't have this issue. ...  ... And it sucks if you need your latte but are staring at the clock for that upcoming meeting.

REVIEW #14:  4 stars  (208 chars)

Something about this Starbucks...I've never had a long wait. Ever. and the service is nice.

REVIEW #17:  4 stars  (275 chars)
The Starbucks is easy access right off the 215 and flamingo. Not my favorite as service is way slow at the drive-through if there's one person in line  it doesn't take long for to get backed up. Great if you're the first person in line not so good if you're the third person.

REVIEW #18:  4 stars  (328 chars)
This is one of my go-to Starbucks.  Right off of Flamingo in the same parking lot as the LVAC.  Very good staff, and never as packed and busy as most of the other Starbucks in the area.   ...  ... Also has a drive-thru for those lazy mornings when that good song is on the radio and you don't feel like parking and going inside.

REVIEW #19:  4 stars  (803 chars)
This place is another great Starbucks location. The staff is efficient and very friendly. It also has a drive through and to be honest...I have never been inside. I always use the drive thru at this store. ...  ... The reason I love this location so much is because it is located right next to the Las Vegas Athletic Club  that I go to in the morning. That's why it is the perfect location for me. That is also why I have never been inside. I am usually to lazy to get out of the car after I leave the gym, so I head straight to the drive thru for some Starbucks Blonde Roast or an ice coffee, depending on what I'm in the mood for. ...  ... Like I said, the staff is very quick here. The drive thru line is always moving even when they are very busy. I do not recall ever having to wait very long here.

REVIEW #20:  4 stars  (793 chars)
This Starbuck's is located at Flamingo Road west of the 215. It is convenient to the 215 motorists and shoppers that patronize Sear's Grand, Target, and the businesses in the vicinity of the 215 at Flamingo Road. ...  ...    This Starbuck's has also been convenient for me. After hiking in Red Rock Canyon and having a dinner somewhere, I have stopped here to get my second wind.  ...  ...   This is a fitting Starbuck's to relax with a warm cup of coffee before the drive back to Henderson. During the Holidays it is a charming spot to sit by a Christmas Tree drinking a coffee with pumpkin spice syrup. ...  ...  The service has improved. On my last visit the baristas were fast and friendly. I appreciate the sufficient parking and that it stays open til 9 pm on Saturday. Yay!  I am a fan.

REVIEW #21:  4 stars  (539 chars)
This Starbucks is conveniently located right off of the 215, so I use the drive-thru at least once a week on the way to work in Hendertucky after I drop my son off at school.  The staff is always very friendly and I'm never in line for more than ten minutes.  The convenience and speed of service cannot be beat.  Last week I even had the customer in front of me perform an act of kindness and pay for my nonfat latte--that only happens to me at Starbucks' drive-thru's and it's always a nice way to start the day.  Payin' it forward, too.

REVIEW #22:  3 stars  (429 chars)
Baristas aren't as friendly as other locations and the outdoor seating is limited to about 3-4 tables and with the weather being as nice as it is now, this place is not ideal location to enjoy your drink outside since you probably won't be able to find a place to sit. ...  ... Parking gets a little cramped, especially when people do not know how to park! ...  ... One good thing about this place is that they have a drive-thru.

REVIEW #23:  3 stars  (138 chars)
Decent customer service, some times slow. Drinks are consistently average. Not great, not horrible. 3 Stars. Average Starbucks experience.

REVIEW #24:  3 stars  (864 chars)
This Starbucks probably has the worst customer service in the area, but I go here for convenience. Due to it's mass corporate-ness, all drinks taste the same at every location, so I'm willing to deal with some frowney people to satiate my green tea latte addiction. ...  ... They have a drive thru, but it's definitely a slow one. I always tip at least $2 at the window, and usually they just ignore me when I tell them to keep the change and walk over to their change jar. I don't expect balloons and ribbons or anything, but just an acknowledgement like at other locations would be nice. Most times I don't even know if they hear me. ...  ... I've never had a problem with the drinks here, they're always correct and hot. If you haven't tried their green tea latte.. do it! In the summer it's good iced with no syrup and vanilla subbing in as the sweetener.. mm.

REVIEW #25:  2 stars  (64 chars)
Super slow drive through. Like five to seven minutes a car slow.

REVIEW #26:  2 stars  (216 chars)
Terribly slow drive thru and they always make my drinks wrong! Great location and a few nice baristas, but they don't make up for a poorly made $5 latte. I'd rather go out of my way to Sbucks on Trop and Fort Apache.

REVIEW #27:  1 stars  (236 chars)
Horrible customer service!  to make a long story short...I will go out of my way to find a different coffee place next time!  The barista was friendly, but the supervisor (i think) with short blond hair has a bit of an attitude problem.

REVIEW #28:  1 stars  (410 chars)
obviously I love Starbucks. the food and drink taste good but today the staff was rude, unfriendly and lacked customer service overall. it took 20 minutes to receive my panini (which usually takes 5) other customers were also complaining that their coffee was taking forever. this location is slow, the workers were not doing much and still were not making customers food/drinks. ever heard of a smile, ladies?

REVIEW #29:  1 stars  (607 chars)
This is the worst Starbucks that I have ever been to. I've been here twice in the last couple of days and both times it was just horrible. The girl who takes your order in the drive through is rude and impatient. And has messed up my order both times, yesterday I specifically said extra cream and my coffee came black. Today I ordered and paid for two breakfast sandwiches and she only gave me one. She was rude and unhelpful the whole time. Actually going so far as to roll her eyes. The coffee actually suffered also, not the tasty goodness that it normally is.Needless to say I will never be going back.

REVIEW #30:  1 stars  (278 chars)
WORST Starbucks in Vegas. The drive thru is painfully slow in the mornings. This lady they hired always works the drive thru and is dumb as a sack of bricks. I refuse to visit this location any more! The manager of this store must be blind, or as ignorant as the employees here!

Yesterday I checked in at the wrong Starbucks by accident. Anyways, this is truly the correct one. Sometimes the drive thru is lengthy but going inside is always an option. They are extremely friendly and 98% right on every order.

REVIEW #2:  3 stars  (289 chars)
I went to this Starbucks because I had time to kill before meeting a client nearby. I don't like this as much as the other Starbucks because there's no drive thru, so you have to walk into Albertsons and the ones located in a grocery store usually don't use the phone app (not convenient).

REVIEW #3:  2 stars  (532 chars)
I saw little flying bugs in the pastry cabinet! EW EW EW. On the pastry and flying!!! There was only one guy working so I wasn't too upset about how long the wait was. There were three people waiting for their drinks. But it gave me enough time to choose what I wanted. I ended up getting large passion fruit tea and it tasted like water. My stomach was kinda sick afterwards, not too sure if it was just me over thinking the bug thing or what. But this was my first and last time at this Starbucks. I'll stick to the actual stores.

Watch how they ring you up - they rang me up for a black tea lemonade when I ordered just black tea. The clerk claimed it was because I asked for a splash of flavoring (not even a pump of syrup). 2 drinks + small food items was $20. Bad service and rude employee. ...  ... The employee who made my drink did add the flavoring for me which was nice.  ...  ... Aria - these employees need to be trained up to meet your service levels that I have learned to expect.

REVIEW #2:  4 stars  (517 chars)
Conveniently located for me right by the elevators so that I can blunt my hangover from the night before.  ...  ... The staff is fast and efficient. ...  ... Minus half a point for not being able to take my Starbucks card off my phone, and minutes half a point for not being able to refill my card. Why? Well, that's because Harrah's (or their parent conglomerate company) wants to control every freakin' thing, so they're not fully part of the whole Starbucks network. That right there, my friends, is some douchery.

REVIEW #3:  4 stars  (425 chars)
Perfectly situated right as you exit the guest elevators of Harrah's Casino Hotel, Starbucks is the destination for most guests for a quick breakfast and coffee before hitting the penny slots!  There was usually a line, but it moved quickly.  The only complaint I have is that they didn't put out condiments such as cinnamon and nutmeg, like most other Starbucks do.  The workers were nice and got our orders right each time!

REVIEW #4:  3 stars  (1549 chars)
Starbucks is a corporate chameleon. It can change to whatever environment they are in. The Starbucks in Caesar's Palace is a cafe with a hotel lobby feel. ...  ...    While the new Buffet grand opening in Caesar's Palace got all the press, a new Starbucks in the Augustus Tower opened without a word. To this day, Caesar's Palace is keeping their new Starbucks a secret. In a way, it is like finding Secret Pizza in the Cosmopolitan. ...  ...   On Saturday, I was exploring around Caesar's Palace when I noticed the iconic Starbucks logo near the elevator bank. I decided on the spot to try it. ...  ...   This is a busy Starbucks.  Obviously people who stay in the Augustus Tower enjoy Starbucks. What stood out in my mind is that the seating is a large two sided couch. It is interesting seeing strangers sitting on a couch drinking coffee. On both sides of the couch are wall paintings that celebrate Las Vegas. I said that Starbucks is a corporate chameleon. I uploaded a picture of "Welcome to Starbucks" on a copy of the "Welcome to Las Vegas" sign. One side of the couch faces the hallway of the Augustus Tower, which could be interesting people watching. The other side faces the counter. At the counter, the baristas were friendly.  Near the counter was a constant line. ...  ...    Where the Augustus Tower Starbucks is low on seating capacity, it is high on price. This is the Strip after all. ...  ...    As I said Starbucks is a chameleon. I am optimistic that they will change the personality of future stores to fit into other places.

Starbucks corporate people.... please step up your game! I was pleasantly surprised to see a Starbucks in Caesar's Palace, they are located in the Augustus tower.  I was salivating all morning thinking about a strong cup of Joe and delish pastry, until I visited.  I ordered my usual, an Americano, and when I went to the sugar and creamer counter... there is NO SUGAR IN THE RAW.  Really?  Not only am I getting charged an extra $1 + for all items because its a Starbucks in Vegas, and everything is overpriced, but NO SUGAR IN THE RAW. Get it together, people. If you're going to charge extra, please have our condiments available!

The Thai tea is delicious.  The lemon iced pound cake is very moist and just falls apart in your hand and melts in your mouth.

REVIEW #2:  4 stars  (604 chars)
There's nothing quite like the joy of Starbucks coffee at noon when you wake up in Vegas to discover your room has no coffee maker. ...  ... Located in the food court and on the outskirts of the casino, Starbucks is there to sober you up and keep you awake for the upcoming night. Those responsible people who got to bed at a decent hour will devour all the bagels before you arrive, they currently can't accept gift cards, and you're in Vegas the land of high rollers so the prices are a dollar or so higher than tour hometown Starbucks. ...  ... But I do not care, for I am exhausted and need caffeine!

REVIEW #3:  4 stars  (378 chars)
What can I say. ..a Starbucks is a Starbucks!  That is why they are so popular.  Their product is consistent.  My only complaint--and this for EVERY Starbucks in Vegas is the astronomical prices.  Their items cost almost double what their items cost any where else.  Every Starbucks I entered was completely packed, I can't imagine the price hike is necessary . . . just greedy.

REVIEW #4:  3 stars  (282 chars)
"In the land of the blind the one eyed jack is king" ...  ... In a casino with only two coffee shops and no coffee maker in the room, Starbucks is the king in this castle. Employees stay busy and do a good job. Prices are so high I am surprised Robin Hood doesn't raid them nightly.

REVIEW #7:  3 stars  (1401 chars)
The prices at this Starbucks, located on the floor of the Excalibur casino, are ridiculously inflated, but I expected that considering its location.  It costs $6.25 for a venti latte, and $4 for a slice of lemon loaf or a cinnamon roll, and you don't even get points for being a gold card member.  I only stayed in the Excalibur hotel for one night, but I purchased three or four drinks from this Starbucks during that time (and one from the Starbucks upstairs).  There was only a line once while I was there, but they actually kept us moving pretty quickly through it.  My standard order is a little involved - a grande decaf americano with three inches of steamed breve and 4 pumps of sugar free vanilla syrup but they made them perfectly for my friend and I every time. ...  ... I had a slice of lemon loaf one day and a cinnamon roll the next and both were wonderful.  I have a friend who worked at a different Starbucks who told me that all their pastries come in frozen and they thaw them to sell.  It's a little hard to believe that the cinnamon roll had ever been frozen as it was rather tasty.  There were some small cafe tables to sit at between the Starbucks and the poker tables.  The workers were friendly enough, though not overly perky. ...  ... The location was handy for those wanting something a little stronger than the free drinks the casino hands out, but with an opposite effect.

REVIEW #8:  3 stars  (361 chars)
This location is located inside the mezzanine of The Excalibur Hotel and does not take the Starbucks application feature. ...  ... Bring Cash or Card but do not expect this Starbucks to work on your phone. ...  ... The two fellas we approached when we wanted a late night coffee fix were kinda looking as if they had a better thing to do. ...  ... They were ok.

REVIEW #9:  3 stars  (402 chars)
This review is for the Starbucks inside the Excalibur Hotel on the casino level.  ...  ... I work in the area so have visited this location many times.  ...  ... Being Las Vegas it goes without saying that they're overpriced. They're also usually under staffed. In the morning you can expect a long wait for your coffee. ...  ... Other than these negatives they do ok for being in a casino environment.

REVIEW #10:  2 stars  (358 chars)
I suppose here is where you learn not all Starbucks are created equal?  I had an overpriced extra bold coffee that cost two dollars more than my regular Starbucks.  Maybe they are not even a real Starbucks, just a Starbucks wannabe like the ones in B&N because they did not take Starbucks gift cards.   The staffs here were also somewhat rude and unfriendly.

REVIEW #11:  2 stars  (562 chars)
Like other reviews, this place seemed overpriced but that's not the entire reason for the low rating.  The lady at the register was attempting to take our order while talking (in spanish) to her coworkers.  She ended up messing up my order and the wrong drink being made.  So i went up and requested that it made to be as ordered only to get the correct drink but no flavor except milk.  Seems like I may be giving up on this company as they seem to disappoint me as of late and I'd rather invest my money into somewhere else.  Get your act together Starbucks!!!

REVIEW #12:  2 stars  (298 chars)
Of course the price is super expensive, but seems like almost all Starbucks on LV strip are more expensive. However, the reason why I gave them two stars is because they can't make good Caramel Macchiato. It wasn't strong enough and was too sweet. Luckily, I don't think we will be back here again.

REVIEW #13:  2 stars  (326 chars)
Only one person working (during the 2-5pm BOGO special)...not good. The service was slow but she was very pleasant...unfortunately the drinks did not taste good and only 1 of the 4 drinks we had were finished. This stand is also ridicuslouly marked up....ventis are in the $6 range, wow. It's worse than other hotels for sure.

REVIEW #16:  1 stars  (2103 chars)
My debit card was charged $200 for a $13 total!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ...  ... This past weekend my husband and I spent our anniversary in the Excalibur Hotel in Las Vegas. Upon leaving on Sunday morning 6/31/13 at approximately 8am, my husband stopped at the Starbucks inside the Excalibur Hotel and Casino to get us breakfast. The bill was a little over $13.00. He paid with our debit card and left. We checked out, went to the gas station to get gas to make it back home (Corona, CA) and it was declined. We pulled up our account on our phone and saw that we were charged $200.34. Which left us with NOTHING in our account.  ...  ... We went back to the hotel and explained the situation. The woman helping us had no name tag on, so I couldn't tell you her name. She called the manager, Katie ... who was working in the Luxor hotel, and we waited as she made her way over. Katie was very helpful and tried to look into it but was unable to get very far. She gave us the $13 back and her call phone number. Our bank was closed and we were unable to get money to get home. We finally had to be wired money from family to make it back home safely.  ...  ... We are parents of 3 young girls. This was supposed to be an enjoyable weekend with my husband celebrating our marriage, but our trip to Starbucks (and we are VERY loyal customers) made the end of my vacation horrendous. Someone's mistake OR purposeful act caused us to nearly be stranded without a dime to our name. and we did not have a dime to our name for 24 hours. ...  ... I was able to call my bank this morning and get my money back. We bank with Arrowhead Credit Union.  ...  ... They explained to us that this was NOT a bank error, but a Starbucks employee error. As I am understanding that it is human to error, I felt as if there was something more that could have been done for us. We spend money weekly to your company, and I was given $13 and a "sorry, we can't do anything." Unfortunately "I'm sorry" didn't help us return home, in the least.  ...  ...  ... ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE ending to a vacation. We will not return

REVIEW #17:  1 stars  (598 chars)
Not quite sure how this place can call themselves Starbucks, yet they do not accept the Gold Card or gift cards.  ...  ... They are quite slow at making the overpriced drinks, but I guess they don't care, since they are making a killing. The Excalibur does not have coffeemakers in their rooms, so why not have people pay a decent amount for coffee downstairs?! ...  ... If you plan on staying in the Excalibur, do yourself a favor, and bring your own coffeemaker. You'll save a ton of money, and you won't be cranky walking down to this Starbucks in the morning JUST to get a cup of coffee for $5.

REVIEW #18:  1 stars  (336 chars)
One star for the nice barista Kenneth. This Starbuck's is super slow & overpriced compared to the others. They charged me an extra dollar to get a venti ice water, they didn't have a toaster for my friend's bagel, and they weren't taking gift cards due to "technical difficulties." I'd recommend finding another Starbuck's on the strip.

Drinks come out slow.  Well , Im on vacation so i dont mind waiting.  It was totally slammed at 11 am on sat morning.  I waited 20 mins for my drink.  Worth the wait bc i need coffee every morning or i turn into a gremlin if i dont get it before noon.  I did get my coffee on time.  Did not turn into a gremlin.  Were already out of some pastries, but i dont need pastries i need coffee.

like any other Starbucks but you have to wait about 30-40 minutes to get your coffee when is a event going on at the convention, location is great, I give it a 5 out of 5 but the service is slow as it can be, It's not the guys fault, they just need to put more people on the morning shift, trying to help 60+ people in line with 3 employees, it doesn't sound right. but again the staff is friendly and try their best

REVIEW #6:  3 stars  (953 chars)
WHY SO EXPENSIVE?!?!  ...  ... I know the reason why is because of the rent, but damn. I used to work at Starbucks so I know the normal prices at a Starbucks that's not located on the strip. The 3 stars is not for the service, but for the prices.  ...  ... The staff here was very friendly. They had a good 10 people working which was a shock to me since my store didn't have that many people working at one time. Everyone was doing something and they made my drink within a couple minutes which was pretty quick.  ...  ... Ordered a simple grande iced coffee, no classic, 2 pumps white mocha.  ...  ... Tasted like how it should have. Great service, but not so friendly prices. When you need coffee though, you need coffee. So the price doesn't really matter when you are tired!  ...  ... **A plus is that it's located in between the casino and the convention center so if you are headed to a meeting/convention you can easily stop by here for a drink.

REVIEW #13:  1 stars  (197 chars)
Stayed at the Mandalay Bay for the weekend came to Starbucks 3 times and all 3 times they're was some kind of drama.  These ladies don't give a shit.  Prepare to have a coffee with a side of drama.

REVIEW #14:  1 stars  (382 chars)
The employees at this location are RUDE! They are so miserable. They don't even call out your name when your drink is ready. I tried to use my free birthday drink coupon and the girl got bitchy and was like "we aren't a real Starbucks so we don't take those." Well clearly... I would be disturbed if you were a "real" Starbucks. ... Pass this fake-ass place and go to a "real" Sbux.

Caffeine was needed. ...  ... Starbucks was there.

REVIEW #2:  4 stars  (661 chars)
Oh, this Starbucks isn't all that bad.  It's huge.  Lots of comfy seating.  The staff is nice.  They do charge a little bit more.  It's in a casino.  But they charge more at the airport, too, where you probably need it most.  Life goes on.   ...  ... I'm pleased that they take a Starbucks card.  It pisses me off when casino Starbucks, like the one in the Golden Nugget, won't take the card.  The damn card is the only reason why I go to Starbucks instead of going out of my way for better coffee. ...  ... This location is crazy efficient, too.  A little better in my experience than the one by the convention center. It's a good option while in Mandalay Bay.

REVIEW #3:  4 stars  (465 chars)
Starbucks just never disappoints me! I am a full on starbucks fan! Tonight, I was actually lucky. There was some sort of glitch with the system so I got a dollar discount on my green tea latte! =) But back to the service and its product- service was golden! Although there was problems with the system, the workers still gave off a friendly attitude and made up the time spent with the register, with their fast customer service and in making the drinks in a flash!

REVIEW #4:  3 stars  (1343 chars)
A Starbucks shop inside Mandalay Bay go figure only in Vegas. I am a big coffee drinker. Like most people, I love to have that first cup of coffee in the morning to get me going. But I also like to have a cup in the evening sometimes as well. We are not limited to the same old coffee flavors anymore; in recent years there has been a real jump in the numbers and kinds of flavored coffees available. I think that the best selection of flavored coffee can be found at Starbucks, which has become one of the best-known coffee brands in the United States. Of course, their reputation was built on their quaint little coffee shops. Unfortunately, these shops are limited in number, and many of us have to settle for a tiny coffee bar in our local Barnes and Noble store. The company has recognized the value of its' brand, and has branched out by selling their product at major grocery stores and on the Internet. Starbucks online is a nifty place to shop for this unique Seattle product, whether for yourself or for gifts.  ... i really enjoy going to this Starbucks. The barista women there were so friendly and they definitely acted like they actually cared about how my day was going. We had casual chit chat ask where i am from and the service was very quick and above average. The drink mocha frap no whip was prepared exactly like i asked.

REVIEW #5:  3 stars  (488 chars)
It's Starbucks ... so really a review isn't necessary ... it's average coffee, nothing special.  I only go to Starbucks because I like their Skinny Cinnamon Dulce latte and because I typically have gift cards from clients and loan officers. ...  ... The line here is incredibly long ... and I can tell you know that there is another coffee shop just inside where the doors are to the taxi line at Mandalay Bay and it has a fraction of the line (and probably a fraction of the price, too).

REVIEW #6:  3 stars  (437 chars)
It's Starbucks and it's Vegas, but still no excuse to overcharge for a cup of coffee. ...  ... Usually a long line in the morning, even if they serve up cups of coffee faster than my local Starbucks. Friendly service too.  ...  ... I soon found out there was a coffee shop in THEHotel lobby, I think it was just called "THE Coffee Shop", that served a good cup of coffee for about a buck cheaper, just as friendly, without the long line.

REVIEW #7:  3 stars  (272 chars)
It's Starbucks... If they screwed up, they'd just rename it Seattle's Best. ... It's in a resort, so it's expensiver and those patrons are employees and attendees of whatever convention is in town. ...  ... The set up is nice and a bit unique. ...  ... It's a Starbucks...

REVIEW #8:  3 stars  (172 chars)
It's your average Strip Starbucks, but totally doomed to a 30 minute wait if you stop there while there's a convention going on.  Only one register meant lines and lines...

REVIEW #9:  3 stars  (448 chars)
Meh, its a Starbucks in a hotel.  Its crowded, the staff isn't friendly (at least the staff at the counter isn't), and everything is overpriced.  Its not bad, but its also not great. Luckily the woman making our drinks was super super nice, which made up for the really angry and unpleasant woman at the counter.  Its certainly better coffee than the terrible coffee at the place right outside the elevators in Mandalay, so I guess it was worth it.

REVIEW #10:  3 stars  (165 chars)
Open from 5am to 11pm. Not the quickest spot in town but at least it's open late. The last time I was here, a girl made a mistake on my drink, so I got a free one :)

REVIEW #11:  3 stars  (130 chars)
Regular starbucks within Mendalay Bay. Super long lines. Service is ok. Prices yanked up $1-2 just because it is in Vegas,(really)

REVIEW #12:  3 stars  (282 chars)
The staff is very nice at this Starbucks. It's right in the Mandalay Bay - the lines are super long. They take my Starbucks card - point right there! But they did not have the scanners for the phone app - hopefully soon! ...  ... They move a little slower. But, eh, savor and enjoy.

REVIEW #13:  3 stars  (517 chars)
They were understaffed for a Sunday morning. There were 16 people in line and they only had one person at the register. This is the management's fault, though, not the employees' fault. ... The (expensive! at least $1 above regular Starbucks prices) drinks came out fairly quickly after we ordered since there were two people making drinks. The layout and look of the store was nice, but there was trash on the ground and a bunch of crumbs on a few tables..which was not pleasant to see right before leaving Vegas. :(

REVIEW #14:  3 stars  (286 chars)
This place is always pretty busy which overwhelms the baristas and they forget the SMILE. Seating is plentiful inside of the SB and out. ...  ... Don't forget, it's inside of a Casino/Hotel and they don't take GCs, prices may be slightly higher nor do they have an outdoor seating area.

REVIEW #15:  3 stars  (356 chars)
This Starbucks gets crowded early. Line can be hugely long. They abide by Starbucks standards so you will get what you order. They do accept the Starbucks card. However, at the time, they did not have the "scanner" thingy to use the iPhone app. But if you're in a hurry, the fastest way to get out of there is to charge your items to your room. If you can.

REVIEW #16:  2 stars  (219 chars)
It's a Starbuck, enough said.  The staff was friendly though and they suggested a drip coffee with low acidity which hit the spot.  They would have gotten 3 stars but this location doesn't have a toaster for the bagels.

REVIEW #17:  2 stars  (759 chars)
Not sure what's wrong with both of the Starbucks locations inside Mandalay Bay.  I know they're not a "true" Starbucks but geez, with the sign out front and the black uniforms, I think they should uphold the Starbucks standards. ...  ... Yeah, you'll have to pay a hefty premium for anything you purchase in there.  A grande coffee at a normal location is what, $1.75, here, it's $3.05 not to mention it's watered down, I can't figure it out, their coffee seems to always be watered down! ...  ... Also, they don't serve your typical Starbucks pastries, such as the pound cakes and such.  They do have bagels, Chocolate Croissant, Cheese Danish and a crapload of those Costco steroid muffins. ...  ... If you're a Starbucks snob, consider yourself forewarned.

REVIEW #18:  2 stars  (125 chars)
OK, I needed coffee so bad so I paid $2.65 or so just to have a grande coffee???  Yes, it is a Starbucks but......had better.

REVIEW #19:  2 stars  (102 chars)
Overpriced in comparison to a regular Starbucks and unfriendly employees to make it even more special.

REVIEW #20:  2 stars  (208 chars)
Probably the most expensive Starbucks I've ever seen, compared to the other resorts on the strip! ...  ... I will give this one additional star since the staff was friendly and they do accept Starbucks Cards.

REVIEW #21:  2 stars  (142 chars)
The line was way too long because there was only one cashier. They were getting mixed up with their orders and thats what made it really long.

REVIEW #22:  2 stars  (596 chars)
There is nothing special about this place as matter a fact it is not as nice as a neighborhood Starbucks but what it is, is grossly over priced. Mandalay Bay is charging more than double what the normal price of coffee is. I pay $2.17 for a medium coffee and they charge $4.25!!!. This is beyond ridiculous even though I know it is aimed at fleecing the tourist I still find this shameful. ...  ... Not even in the airport or the toll road system back east do they gouge people like this. My advice to anyone is stay thirsty my friends before you give Mandalay Bay a penny for a Starbucks coffee.

REVIEW #23:  1 stars  (148 chars)
I HATE IT!!!!!!! ... They charge you twice the amount, than you would normally pay at the neighborhood corner SB's. ... It's the same coffee dammit!

REVIEW #6:  3 stars  (615 chars)
I recently read a book where the author bragged about Starbucks and their excellent service and how they will make her coffee in a customer provided travel mug. I tried that here and was told no. The problem with most airport Starbucks is the employees don't actually work for Starbucks and the stores are part of some large concession management operation. Thats why the airport employees basically suck. I do however blame Starbucks, because they should demand anyone serving their products to do so proffessionally. Retrospectfully, the three star rating is because the lady at least tried to act like she cared.

REVIEW #7:  3 stars  (460 chars)
Just visited today. Have to say they were quick taking our order but 4 people who ordered after us rec'vd their coffee before we did...WTH!!  Coffee was delicious as always but would have appreciated not being forgotten ;-( .... They had several tasty treats which as others have said great for grab and go. Also the staff was friendly.  Did notice they were out of supplies as the employee had to leave the coffee bar area to get forks for salad we purchased.

REVIEW #8:  3 stars  (298 chars)
Solid Starbucks.  Waiting to pick up my kids from their unaccompanied minor flight.  Need some caffeine to keep going.  They took my Starbucks gold card (so I can get my rewards points!).  Drink made quickly even though I made a change.  (Forget to say "iced") ...  ... Overall, I enjoyed my drink.

REVIEW #9:  3 stars  (135 chars)
Starbucks is cheaper than bottled water at McCarren Airport, if you can believe it. Get an iced coffee here here instead of that Evian.

REVIEW #10:  3 stars  (162 chars)
The McDonalds of coffee.  Standard service.  Standard coffee.  Still surprised it draws in the number of people it does given the amount of cafes here in Madison.

REVIEW #11:  3 stars  (66 chars)
The only place you can get a drink and snack in McCarran under $9.

REVIEW #12:  3 stars  (465 chars)
There are several starbucks located throughout LAS airport gates.  The line is always LONG in the morning time.  I know people want to get a cup of coffee to wake them up but god, they need to have more staff in the morning hours to fulfill the duties! ...  ... Tip: If you are not buying drinks or you can consume quickly.  Try to buy your drink at the location before you hit the security. Its almost no wait over there and avoid the morning rush hour if you can.

REVIEW #13:  3 stars  (347 chars)
This tiny little Starbucks sees more customers than Southwest Airlines.  They try to keep up with the demand but the lines are always long and many times the staff is pulling their hair out just to keep up with the demand.  My coffee is always hot and tastes like any other Starbucks but don't expect exceptional customer service at this location.

REVIEW #14:  3 stars  (177 chars)
Typical airport Starbucks. Small, with not much room for a line. Very fast with the drinks. The staff member who took my order was very friendly. Definitely a grab and go place.

We were getting ready to board our plane back home from Vegas and needed a quick drink fix for the flight. It's just like any other starbucks you'd go to, since there are like a million stores out there... I got what I usually get which was the green tea lemonade and my girlfriend got the Pumpkin Spice Latte! Hoorah! Fall season drinks are back at Starbucks!

REVIEW #17:  2 stars  (323 chars)
Came in at the end of the day, 7PM-ish.  The staff were very nice and attentive and got to me right away.  And my drink was made in a timely manner.  I had the coffee frappuccino, which I did not particularly enjoy, it was a just too bland for me.  The prices, on the account that we were in an airport, didn't help either.

REVIEW #18:  2 stars  (344 chars)
I visited here yesterday while waiting for my flight at Gate B.  I haven't had anything to eat all morning and ordered a chocolate scone and Tazo tea.  The tea was normal as expected and the chocolate scone tasted decent.  However, an hour after I finished eating, I wasn't feeling very well.  Fortunately, the feeling passed a few hours later.

REVIEW #19:  2 stars  (551 chars)
Most Starbucks have improved greatly where you can get quick and correct orders.  ...  ... This airport location is right off the Alaska Airlines flight from Seattle 'gates'. So most folks hit it on the landing or exit to get their caffeine fix.  ...  ... It is run by only two employees (in fairness, it is a small location so don't think more than 2 can fit without being on top of each other).  ...  ... They do their best to move quickly but with just 1 person working while 1 takes orders - it can have long lines depending on what time you land.

REVIEW #22:  2 stars  (397 chars)
The designer of this particular Starbucks was not very bright.  ...  ... Apparently they never anticipated lines at 6 am in the Las Vegas airport. Sheesh. Getting in and out is awful. In addition, there is only one espresso machine... which equals 1 person making your drinks.  ...  ... The only good thing is that I actually had foam in my latte (something other Starbucks have not gotten right).

REVIEW #23:  2 stars  (169 chars)
The service here is not Starbucks best effort.  Out of 1/2 & 1/2, out of napkins and very dirty.   ...  ... Coffee was great as always, it's really hard to mess that up.

REVIEW #24:  2 stars  (451 chars)
Will this be my last review of a Starbucks? Perhaps not, but it will be the last time I visit this one. ...  ... I was not impressed with anything here. The wait, the line, the service the flavor of the coffee - not up to Starbucks standards for sure! ...  ... I may not be a coffee expert, but I know that this place needs some massive changed. Even the staff came in inadequate. Thank goodness for Jamba Juice or I'd be very thirsty at this airport!

REVIEW #27:  1 stars  (426 chars)
Probably the worst Starbucks I've ever experienced. ...  ... These employees were clearly airport employees, not trained in the Starbucks program. They were inefficient, slow, rude, and they didn't make my drink right. Additionally, airport prices are exorbitant - $10 for a latte and a bottle of water.  ...  ... I want my coffee. I don't want to wait 20 minutes in a 3-person line for a drink that isn't even made correctly.

REVIEW #28:  1 stars  (1968 chars)
Starbucks is the place I count on everywhere I go. Within the United States. In other countries. ...  ... This had to be the worst Starbucks experience ever. I didn't mind the slow service and expensive prices. I did, however, very much mind:  ... 1) the cashier who was bad mouthing customers. She did not care that all the customers in line can hear her complain to her coworkers about how customers made their work more difficult. ... 2) the attitude the barista gave me.  ...  ... Side story:  I'm lactose intolerant and Starbucks is the only chain coffee shop I know that still doesn't offer free soy milk. Usually I'll ask for a splash of soy milk to my coffee and most times they'll give it to me free of charge since I just want a little bit. Sometimes they'll charge me the 50 cents, but they give me a lot of soy milk, so that's okay. ...  ... I forgot to add soy milk when I ordered so I asked the barista. All she said to me was "pay 79 cents".  I was already irritated by the cashier. It was also early in the morning with a long line and now attitude. I explained to her that I'm lactose intolerant and basically can't use the "free" milk as creamer. She looked at me and said "then pay 79 cents". Her tone did it for me. I lost my cool and shouted "Are you friggin' serious? I just want a little bit of soy milk" and showed her my cup that was brimming with coffee. "It's company policy. If you want it, pay 79 cents." I walked off before potentially hurling my coffee at her. ...  ... At the sugar table, a lady who overheard the conversation told me that this is the only Starbucks she knows that charges for every little thing. Then she realized that the barista had forgotten the toffee nut syrup in her coffee. She asked the barista and it was dj vu all over again. The lady told the barista several times that she already paid her 79 cents for the toffee nut syrup. I had my flight to catch, so I wished the lady good luck and walked out of there.

REVIEW #29:  1 stars  (384 chars)
Terminal B Starbucks should be on the list to shut down. Had to wait 5min so they could "Brew" a cup. I darted out to catch my flight, tasted my "brewed" coffee. Taste like hot water. Obviously, this place is a Vegas scam. They know you won't  come back to complain because you need to get on a flight, and you don't want to get back in their scam line. Don't wast you time and money!

REVIEW #30:  1 stars  (204 chars)

I live and come from an area where Starbucks are not on every corner and my taste buds always preferred Tim Horton's. However, because of the amount of travel I do - Starbucks has become ingrained in my head and it seems I cannot live without them. ...  ... I stay mostly at Courtyards who now have a Starbucks in them - however - these are NOT the same Starbucks you find outside - trust me! ...  ... Whether it's that special cup you need at the airport or that one you have to have in the morning - I loved having this one right around the corner.  ...  ... This chain does it right too - consistently good and the staff went above and beyond - friendly and fast. Though small (airport) the speed of delivery was great!

They made the two drinks for us quickly and perfectly.  There was no line which was quite surprising.  I was amazed when I saw how easy it was to saunter up, order my drink, and be on my way to my Los Angeles Times. ...  ... I like this outlet in the A gates at McCarran.

Not a big fan of Starbucks but they are all over the strip so I went to Starbucks plenty of times in Vegas to get my coffee fix.  I think their coffee is ok and the lines there are just ridiculously long.  Over rated in my eye.  But it's great to just have a coffee joint to go to while in Vegas.

Did I mention that there was only one customer in front of me in line and that there were three employees? Did I also mention that the girl taking my order was also chatting it up with another airport employee who passed by the Starbucks stand? Annoying.  ...  ... The mocha wasn't even that good. Also, it is Vegas and the airport so drinks are way more than at a normal Starbucks. I was very disappointed. C'mon girls, I was just stopping by to kill some time while I waited for my bags. ...  ... Thank God that I was soon drinking a real drink on the strip which helped ease the pain of this experience.

REVIEW #6:  4 stars  (578 chars)
We love Starbucks and readily admit we are Starbucks addicts. Hard to believe but this location is more expensive than the Strip area Starbucks that we visited earlier today.  ...  ... So, why the 4 star rating? Because they pulled the usual airport Starbucks trick of saying that their server was down and couldn't accept our gold card. Really? That is an old trick. So when my hubby said that we couldn't buy anything, the response was, oh no we can try it. Amazing it worked. Those tricky old servers! Just cannot trust a computer.  ...  ... The coffee? Absolutely wonderful.

REVIEW #7:  3 stars  (675 chars)
Ah, it is always such sad sorrow to leave the adult Disney World known as Las Vegas. Back to humdrum reality. ...  ... Located near the end of the D gate area this kiosk location served it's purpose with a grande iced coffee while waiting for my flight out of Sin City. Baristas working the counter were pleasant, and this small Starbucks has many of the normal coffee, snack, and food offerings to make a quick grab and go to your flight. ...  ... As I boarded my plane with coffee in hand I was serenaded by the clink clinks of the slot machines that line the floor near the gates beckoning me back for another swing through the city that whatever happen there stays there.

REVIEW #11:  3 stars  (900 chars)
Sometimes life just isn't complete without a cup of joe ... from Starbucks. Or in my case, green tea or some sort of frappuccino. Considering how locals and visitors are out and about during all hours, it's quite true that caffeine fixes are important in LV. Whether it means you're coming to start an epic weekend or leaving your sins behind for another destination, this airport Starbucks is here to serve you. ...  ... All the basic airport location rules apply: higher prices and wicked lines during the afternoon. I would never hold it against the staff for having to deal with unruly and stressed out travelers, but I've had decent results here. My typical experience involves no lines, becoming $5 poorer with a cold vanilla bean frappuccino in hand and on my way out. ...  ... Don't come in expecting any wifi, seating, or Starbucks cafe music. This concourse D joint is more kiosk than cafe.

REVIEW #12:  3 stars  (332 chars)
This is just one of the many Starbucks in Las Vegas. Several at LAS alone. I was so fed-up with Starbucks by the time I got to this one that, that, THAT....yeah, I stopped and bought myself another Latte for the way home. Only a few and very minimal differences from your Neighborhood Starbucks. Main difference is computer related.

REVIEW #13:  2 stars  (345 chars)
I got to the cashier and she walked off, went to the back without,  saying anything to me or any of the other customer's.  The next server assisted us after 5min, so after placing my order, they tell me that the Starbucks app, or gift cards do not work. This is the 2nd time at the airport and Starbucks gift cards do not work...why is that so..

REVIEW #14:  2 stars  (658 chars)
I mean what can you say, it's a Starbucks in an airport. I don't know whether to blame the cashier that rang me up or the guy that was making the drinks, but on top of messing up the drink order for the lady before me, he also messed up mine, so it obviously took double the time to get the drinks. Even with him having to remake mine, it was still slightly off. He did kinda have this "I'm just here to work" swagger, not much in the attentive customer service department. ...  ... It is what it is, at least it's the same prices and not more expensive compared to a regular Starbucks location. They do take the Starbucks card for payment, so that's a plus.

This Starbucks is located in the D Concourse of McCarran International Airport - all the way at the far end of the Concourse by D Gates 52 through 58. ...  ... On the one hand, I am grateful for the caffeine fix I received as the result of this Starbucks, but I was feeling particularly crabby and impatient this morning (fighting Bronchitis) and the line seemed to take forever to move. It was probably only five minutes - BUT there were only two people in line in front of me. There were four Starbucks employees behind the counter. One was running the register, one making drinks, and two doing "busy work" (stocking, etc.). ...  ... When I finally got to the register, I ordered a Tall coffee - WITH ROOM FOR CREAM! and a bottle of water As I ordered this, I stated it loud and clearly. I immediately opened the coffee - and she had filled it to the brim. I restated politely: "I asked for ROOM FOR CREAM." She then emptied a bit out and told me if I needed still more room to empty it into the trash can. ...  ... I understand that Starbucks is probably not a career choice folks - but please listen to your customers. Exercise some self awareness. And always, ALWAYS, whatever you do in life, choose to excel and do the best possible job one can. ...  ... Here is the direct link for this particular Starbucks: ... http://www.starbucks.com/store/10743

REVIEW #16:  2 stars  (283 chars)
Was not able to use my gift card here.  Only explanation I got was "Sorry, Starbuck's system is down" ...  ... After reading other reviews here, the problem with "Starbuck's System" seems to be consistent at this location. ...  ... Otherwise, it's okay if you like overpriced coffee.

REVIEW #17:  1 stars  (250 chars)
If you need your Starbucks fix before your flight, all airport Starbucks don't accept any member reward promotions or any other promotions that every other Starbucks outside the airport accept. Also, they didn't accept any gift cards or rewards card.

REVIEW #18:  1 stars  (373 chars)
Really? ... A ton of flights leaving at 6am, at the E gates, and they don't open till 6am?? ...  ... At 5:30 there is a line of 9 customers already waiting in the area. ...  ... They can't say it's due to no customers, as I went thru TSA at about 5am, and there has been a steady flow walking by, looking to buy coffee. ...  ... This location needs to get with the program.

REVIEW #19:  1 stars  (152 chars)
Sorry, our starbucks card system is down...  Funny, other credit cards work just fine. Time to get your act together and support your own payment system

REVIEW #20:  1 stars  (264 chars)
The only reason why this location receives one star is merely due to the fact that the coffee didn't make me barf. This location is terrible in flavor, freshness, and service.. Every time I order a drink, I have to go back and return it. Do not recommend at all :(

REVIEW #21:  1 stars  (266 chars)
The only SANE reason I would pay $5 for an iced tea is for the discounted refills. Apparently they don't do that here. I freakin hate the inconsistencies between Starbucks locations! I'm learning to stick to the few good locations around Las Vegas & ignore the rest.

REVIEW #22:  1 stars  (212 chars)
You would think that a Starbucks located in an airport would be more customer focused, extremely disappointed. Drink is terrible and this was after it was remade (which I had to pay for) and I had a rude barista.

Hooray for caffeine!  ...  ... As you can imagine the airport location is always busy.   This crew has their operation flowing smoothly.  The line was a bit longer but I had the time to wait for my morning brew.  They were quick to take orders so the line moved quite fast.   It did however seem to take a little more time for my order to finish though.   I do understand how busy and hectic it can be.  But as always, my order was perfect and very tasty!   ...  ... Since I always have my Starbucks card, it's an easy choice when choosing where to get my coffee.  And they open at 4:30 am for those early morning flights which is always a bonus.   ...  ... Thanks Starbucks for starting my day off with a kick!

They were open at 5:49 am.   ...  ... This was a big deal for us!  We were on an early flight home on a Monday morning, so it was nice to have breakfast before we boarded our plane.  A grande Awake Tazo, a bowl of oatmeal, a tall nonfat latte and a danish, as well as a bottle of Fiji water for the plane, cost $16.27.

REVIEW #5:  3 stars  (442 chars)
Ok this place just gets 3 stars... Here's the positive: your in a captive environment so thankfully it's here, the staff is always very friendly and work with a sense of urgency, the coffee is always on par.... Here's the not so good: There's no seating at all, there's always a pretty big line, the costs are around 25% higher than your used to paying for the same drink elsewhere and they don't give you any stars if you use your gold card.

REVIEW #8:  2 stars  (525 chars)
Due to the airport remodel, Gate C5 is now Gate C16.  Same location, same so-so expectations.    What is new these days is the BLONDE ROAST coffee that is being pushed in all locations, except here.  They sell the beans, the Via, put up banners...  and yet, none brewed.  C'mon!  WTF?   ...  ... This is the difference between corporate-owned and franchise Starbucks stores.  Same beans, different brand of service and higher prices.  Staff is nice and do their best to keep the lines down.  Can't ask for much at an airport.

REVIEW #9:  2 stars  (165 chars)

REVIEW #10:  2 stars  (207 chars)
This review for the one at Gate C5: ...  ... Thankful they open at 5am... gotta have my caffeine for these early morning trips, but this one seems to short my cup no matter what size.  What's that all about?

REVIEW #11:  2 stars  (1058 chars)
This Starbucks was a bit difficult to find at first. It is stuck in a place that is small and when the line gets long you have to like fit together to order and to be able to be close enough to hear your name called. I think they were doing construction of some kind that is why the wall was so close to the entrance of this location .  ...  ... The staff was only in a rushing mood. "What do you, how do you want it, pay me now and move on..." So do not expect any real kindness.  ...  ... The line was so long. I mean I had time, only because I am addicted to their green and really wanted some before I got on my flight. So what better way to spend the time then to wait in love for something you love. I got through to the cash register quickly, but waited a lot longer then I would have liked for just some shaken green tea.  ...  ... The prices were not too bad for being an airport, of course they are a bit higher, but I got the green tea and a cinnamon coffee cake for $6 bucks. Not ridiculous I suppose.  ...  ... Its there, that is pretty much it.

Our MGM room didn't have a coffee maker.  Go figure... ...  ... I would have been extremely cranky with the missing component of my liquid diet had this Starbucks had not been conveniently placed next to the food court.  As a bonus, the baristas didn't even crack a smile at the giant penis I wore on my head half the time I was in Vegas.  Thank you, Starbucks, for not letting me down, and for keeping it classy as you brewed my chai latte.

REVIEW #3:  4 stars  (297 chars)
This is my favorite of two Starbucks at the MGM Grand.  Lines aren't as long and the staff is nicer.  Come to think of it, the two things are probably related!  They are always willing to bring my order to my table when I ask them to. I usually stop here on my way to the Monorail to start my day.

REVIEW #4:  3 stars  (774 chars)
Since most casinos won't put a coffee machine in the rooms we are stuck heading down to the main floor to get a cup of joe. ...  ... As I was here these past few days attending a convention along with thousands of others the lines always seemed long but they moved pretty quickly. Normal Starbucks menu and the baristas were nice. Some seating to get a good people watching view and observe all the drunken bachelorette parties stumble by at night. As it was also the Country Music Awards weekend here I also got to watch all the country music freakozoids walk by with all their overdone western gear on. Yee-Haw! Look - another cowboy hat!   ...  ... At least this one is open 24 hours for late night or early morning caffeine fix. It's one of three locations in MGM alone!

REVIEW #5:  3 stars  (758 chars)
So, we watched/previewed a television show at the CBS Television City place inside the MGM, and we pretty much each got $5 gift certificates to Starbucks. ... We used them today. I got a tall chocolate chip frappuccino for $4.75 +tax. He got his normal grande iced caramel macchiato.  ... We just paid for whatever was over $5 each and tip! ... Unfortunately, there were only two employees working the location. One was behind the register. One was making ALL the drinks... and there were a lot of drinks! It took about ten minutes to get our two drinks.  ... The plus side? The reason I'm giving them three stars? The drinks were made extremely well! We were quite impressed with their taste, and although the service was slow, the employees were very nice.

REVIEW #6:  3 stars  (580 chars)
You know how Starbucks are very efficient, run like a well oiled machine, etc.?  These were hit and miss.  ...  ... One morning, I went to the one next to the Avenue Cafe.  The staff was made up of old, oriental women that did not seem to understand English, walked extremely slow, and looked like it could be their first day staring at their cash register screens like they didn't know what to do.  They were obviously getting paid by the hour, not transaction.  ...  ... Typical products there, but no egg sandwiches?!?  They did have the toaster, and would warm up bagels, etc.

REVIEW #7:  2 stars  (1449 chars)
"my review is subjective" ... 1.5 stars ... My first time to the MGM Grand and well they could get away with murder here( at the Starbucks not the MGM), I am sure they make a bunch of change here just because of the location. It seemed that everyone of the occupants was in line at 7:30 am. The coffee was good as usual but the prices are outrageous. ...  ... My story... I am in line waiting to place my order when a women and here friend( which had been partying the night before or still going I don't know haha) are coming down this ramp from a buffet or restaurant right next to the Starbucks. One women places both of her hands over her mouth... then RALPHS all over the marble floor right next to all of us ordering. She was desperately looking for a toilette or garbage can. Well she didn't make it. Since she decided to cover her mouth, the barf went in every outward direction possible. After her first go-round she then proceeds to enter the area behind the front counter of the Starbucks where everyone is making drinks and finds some type of container to finish her session off. Her friend was not much help to her. After the Ralph session is over they just leave, no words said, just an early morning delivery and they were off. I will say this, the Starbucks employees did not let this become a distraction for them. They kept the orders coming...  ...  ... Please see my attached photo of the spread out chunks the women left behind.

I have been here a few times when staying in Vegas and I always have a good experience. I did find it odd that they didn't have a toaster, though. But the baristas were nice and we got our order quickly. We usually go on weekday mornings and we've never found it to be overly crowded.  ... This is a great place to grab a cold drink and a small pastry before heading out for the day.

This Starbucks near the monorail entrance was our regular source for breakfast during the trivia championship weekend we attended at the MGM. Each time we went, our orders were filled correctly and promptly, even though it was in a very busy, high--traffic area.

REVIEW #5:  3 stars  (1042 chars)
How come whenever I'm looking for a Starbucks I can never easily find one?  Did you realize there is approximately 1 Starbucks for every 345 square miles in the US.  When I'm looking for one...that number seems about right however when not looking, it seems there is 345 to every square mile. ...  ... Long story short, that was my basic experience during a recent trip to Vegas.  I get very cranky if I do not have my morning coffee and since I am an early riser, I can typically count on Starbucks to be open to allow me my fix. ...  ... Nothing that stands out about this particular Starbucks other than the fact it doesn't offer WiFi. ...  ... The location is busy as it is located within the MGM Grand so I was fully expecting to wait awhile.  Fortunately for me, that wasn't the case as the baristas were quick to greet and equally as quick to serve. ...  ... In summary, it's a Starbucks so you're basically going to get what you expect.....an overpriced drink.  In the mornings, I'm willing to pay almost anything for that black gold.

REVIEW #6:  3 stars  (444 chars)
Plenty of seating for a sort of express Starbucks at the corner of craps tables, a few nightlife venues and a several show rooms inside of the MGM Grand. Cell phone service is somewhat limited if you are on anything other than Verizon. There is no WiFi either at this location for you to connect on. If you need a quick coffee fix before hitting a blackjack table or you are walking to a game of poker, you find this Starbucks to be convenient.

REVIEW #7:  2 stars  (497 chars)
Please retrain your staff, specifically Ariel.  Words like "pinche" and "chinga" can be easily translated for someone who is very familiar with Spanish.  Also, rolling your eyes doesn't help either.  I know my girlfriend didn't hear these things but I was standing right next to her.  I just sucked it up and told myself to stay cool while on vacation and not let a sour piehole like Ariel ruin the vacation.   ...  ... On another note, drinks came out quick and accurate like all other Starbucks.

REVIEW #8:  2 stars  (808 chars)
Went here because it was close and I needed to eat something for under $10.  The drinks and food are overpriced but they are consistent with all the other locations in the casinos.  The staff is pretty nice though so that's always a plus. ...  ... I ordered the oatmeal(about $5) for my late night snack (dinner) and when receiving it, the cup was about half-full with about an inch or so of water covering the oatmeal.  I had to dump some of the water out in the trash just so it wouldn't be like I was eating oatmeal soup. ...  ... I didn't order any coffee but I'm sure it would have been fine.  Either way, it kind of bummed me out a little bit but that's how things go.  Overall for coffee I'm sure they are just fine as they probably are for their other foods and pastries just don't order the oatmeal.

REVIEW #2:  4 stars  (459 chars)
Pretty much your run of the mill Starbucks but prices are slightly higher than you would expect at a standalone Starbucks. Considering this is one within a casino, you can expect your coffee to come with a small premium but quality-wise this is the same and highly convenient. I say convenient because many casinos on the strip do not have large coffee chains so those who are wary of trying specialized coffee places will not have to worry about Monte Carlo.

REVIEW #3:  4 stars  (279 chars)
Prices were very high - but then again, this is Vegas. ...  ... However, the whole place looked very clean, and the baristas were not that slow. At least they do take Starbucks Cards for purchases only, and it's located right by the entrance to the tram station. ...  ... Cheers!

REVIEW #4:  4 stars  (364 chars)
This is actually one of the nicest Starbucks locations in Vegas.  It looks new and clean, and is situated in a food court along with McDonald's, Manchu Wok, Rubio's, Sbarro's, Subway and Hagen Dazs.  You'll find this on your way in (or out) to the CityCenter Tram Station -- perfect for a value meal or breakfast away from the hotel patrons at ARIA or Monte Carlo.

REVIEW #5:  4 stars  (416 chars)
This Starbucks is BUSY! Insanely busy in the morning, expect a huge delay in your morning activities if you have any and leave early if you do. I like that this Starbucks is large and they have most of the items here that most Starbucks elsewhere have. Totally sad that they were sold out of their spinach feta breakfast wrap. They are my fave! Definitely the go to Starbucks for people that stay at the Monte Carlo.

REVIEW #6:  3 stars  (389 chars)
I guess there is nothing for me to say about Starbucks.  This location however, needs a personal review from yours truly.  Merchandising is okay and very much appealing.  Long lines and slow service may prompt you to leave the place but hey, you can't blame them because it is beyond their control. ...  ... My only suggestion be cheerful whenever you take orders. ...  ...  ... Cheers !!!

REVIEW #7:  3 stars  (567 chars)
I know this is just another Starbucks review but I can't go above a three for this location.   ...  ... Being Vegas I anticipate some long lines at times but between the long lines, slow service, and lackluster personalities behind the counter I was completely underwhelmed.  I want consistency when I come to Bucks anywhere and this one leaves me wanting for me. ...  ... Quick note for those traveling to Vegas from other states - my drink was about $1-$1.50 more expensive here so be prepared.  Not a negative just a little surprising when you see the amount owed.

REVIEW #8:  3 stars  (779 chars)
It's nice to know what to expect.   ...  ... In a fantastic city that is known as the entertainment capital of the world, the Monte Carlo Casino was less than impressive.  We had expected something much more spectacular.  If this was, as the other casinos were, a replica of the true-life experience, then Monte Carlo would not be on my Grand Tour itinerary.   ...  ... It was almost a relief to find a little food court in the back of the casino, near the hotel lobby, filled with American concessions.  Starbucks was there.   ...  ... We ordered a grande Tazo shaken tea, a tall nonfat latte, and a raspberry tart for $9.95.  As we enjoyed our snack in a common dining area -- this was a real food court, like you'd find in any mall -- we planned our escape to the next casino.

REVIEW #9:  3 stars  (338 chars)
Meh. Slow service (even during low periods) and boring baristas. I love my neighborhood Starbucks, but I think great service is too much to ask from Vegas Strip businesses.  ...  ... I do warn you, they do not re-charge your Starbucks card at this location. I tried, and failed. Resorted to re-charging my card online with my credit card.

REVIEW #10:  2 stars  (899 chars)
I came here twice. The first time there was a long line which moved fairly quickly. The girl at the register provided neither a greeting nor a smile, and at the end of my experience I discovered the wrong drink topped with whipped cream, which I had requested none of. After she ASKED me and I said no.  ... The second time I came was at 3:00 in the afternoon. No line. I stood at the register for a few minutes while the one girl behind the counter looked at me, then looked back at whatever she was doing (cleaning espresso machine or something) and continued to do it. Then she stopped that and walked toward me... but ha ha, she got me, it wasn't to take my order, it was to walk directly past me to the pastry case and rearrange items. Then after that, did she come to take my order? No, she went to the sink, turning her back to me, and began washing a blender. I turned around and walked out.

He asked me if I just wanted a black tea or a lemonade mixed with tea; I opted for the Arnie Palmer. BIG MISTAKE!  ...  ... My tea tasted like it was made of old lemonade and I guess tasted moldy. My sons child cocoa was half full and cold. Not warm, COLD! My friend suggested I go tell them, but I hate to bother... even though I paid 6$ for the 2 drinks.  ...  ...

Stayed at the Monte Carlo this past weekend and had a blast. Came down to the Food Court and decided to get a Peppermint Mocha before we started walking the strip on a breezy day. There were a few people ahead of me.  ...  ... SERVICE - Slow. I feel like they could create a more organized task for one another and work as a team rather than individuals. I was a bit annoyed when the 2 people that ordered after me got their drinks before me. Let's just say, the staff was fortunate that I was on a mini-vacation and was not in a rush to get my drink.  ...  ... PEPPERMINT MOCHA - One of my favorites, but I was not digging the way my drink was made here. It was semi-hot and the drink tasted very light and frothy. I'm not sure what went wrong. Perhaps they gave me the "skinny" version? I'm glad I opted for the grande size instead of venti. ...  ... ** Suggestion - HIRE MORE WORKERS. Hire 1 more at the very least. It's Vegas and it's bound to get extremely busy on the weekends especially. Would it hurt to have extra hands helping out?

There are 2 Starbucks in the Monte Carlo - one in the food court next to Subway, and one around the corner by the escalators to the tram. The one in the food court is owned by Corporate and will accept your gift cards but not reload them. The one next to the tram is NOT owned by Corporate and will not accept gift cards (and they ran out of my favorite drink. BOO!)

REVIEW #16:  1 stars  (730 chars)
Hubby and I always stay at Aria but there's no Starbucks! The two hotels connect by walkways and escalators so it's very convenient.   ... Besides the convenience, this place can never get both of our drinks correct...EVER! Nor do they ever get our short names right even if we spell it out!  Go to the Starbucks in the food court. They are fast, the drinks are perfect along with our names...and as long as a foreigner who doesn't understand much English steals your drink even though they placed their order AFTER you, everything will go smoothly! ... But we gave this place a couple of tries and the last one was a couple of weeks ago when it seemed that everyone who purchased something from here did not get what they wanted.

If there was a way to rate negatively I would. Long wait. Asked for less ice and all I got was ice. Workers didn't work fast. Taste of the drink was super watered out. Price was not worth it. Totally took my money for a shitty drink. If you have a choice go else where for coffee. It sucks.

When did sbx stop hiring professional baristas? I'm not sure what happened here, but this is one of very few sbx I'm disgusted with the service. ...  ... The cashier (a young man) who took my order seems spacy, inattentive, and...rude?? He was trying to be funny, but inappropriately so. I just want my order taken down correctly, I don't need a comedian. And of course because of his unprofessional-ism, he took my order wrong. The guy who made my drink offer to redo it, but I just wanted to get out of there. ...  ... The second time around was no different. Same cashier, same unproffessional-ism. Still sloppy, and still rude. ...  ... Monte Carlo, I hope you get a wake up call one day. You are in a partnership with sbx, and sbx staff represents you.

REVIEW #25:  1 stars  (592 chars)
With two baristas, both waiting around for an other to be paid for (instead of making orders ahead of time) and cashiers scattering between fetching drinks and taking payments, no wonder there's a line! ...  ... I've been to enough Starbucks to know that this is not how most are run. Mix that with the most processed looking baked goods I have ever seen at a Starbucks -- are these knockoff Costco pastries -- and you have yourself a pretty sad sight.  ...  ... When you expect something standard from a well-known brand, it feels like an even greater fall from grace when it all goes wrong.

REVIEW #26:  1 stars  (200 chars)
Worst Starbucks ever. Long lines and ineffective staff. Sub par baked goods. I guess they feel they can get away with bad service because the convenience of being located in the hotel. That's a shame.

No CAKE POPS!  No chocolate chai mix!  Won't take my Starbucks card.  But at least it's close to the room elevators...

2014 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 44/100 ...  ... The boyfriend and I aren't big drinkers, so fraps at this Starbucks ended up being our first drinks when we first got to Vegas, LOL. This location is nice and big, well lit, and has TONS of seating. We went close to 10pm and they were still open pretty late (might be 24 hours, but I can't remember).  ...  ... I decided to try their new caramel flan frap, which was really good! Much better than the caramel frap or the creme brulee frap, IMO. The boyfriend got a peppermint mocha frap and his was great as well. ...  ... They only had two people working during the time we went, but they were very friendly asian women who worked with smiles on their faces :) ...  ... The only reason why I won't give this Starbucks 5 stars is because it is really expensive. However, all of the Starbucks in LV are much more expensive than normal Starbucks locations are. We got two tall sized fraps and it was over $11...kind of ridiculous.

Found in the New York New York Hotel in Vegas, they really do everything at New York speed, style, and splurging prices! ...  ... Fast cashier, fast drink making, in and out before you know it. ...  ... Want fruits (bananas and the like)? They're legit New York prices at $1.75 a pop! Yikes.

REVIEW #4:  4 stars  (370 chars)
Stopped here a few times for a caffeine fix while staying at NY NY. The staff was very helpful and accommodating my weird drink requests. I'm from Ohio and we have something at Starbucks there that this one had never heard of. But they did their best to match it and it turned out great!  ...  ... The ladies that were working at the time were very friendly and helpful.

REVIEW #5:  4 stars  (383 chars)
This is one of the two locations inside of NYNY. It's located on the main level by most of the restaurants and after a long vegas night, you will need this in the am! The staff here is always friendly and helpful.  ...  ... Some might think that this place is pricey, but nothing in vegas is cheap like the older days use to be.  ...  ... Get over it, your on vacation! YOLO......LOL

REVIEW #6:  3 stars  (434 chars)
Early in the morning, this Starbucks is where you're going to be if you're looking for caffeine in New York, New York.  The line is long and moves slowly, as if they had no idea people were going to show up.  Sure, prices are high and they have silly names for everything, but that's any Starbucks. ...  ... I'll be standing in line but only because they open first.  Three stars because it's not their fault that nobody else is open.

REVIEW #7:  2 stars  (474 chars)
The Starbucks is certainly convenient if you're staying at the New York, New York Hotel & Casino, but the lines are often really long... and they don't have a scanner to pay by iPhone. This is just a counter-service only facility, but there is plenty of seating locating in the Hotel Lobby & Casino, just be warned it often smells smoky in there (I wish they would ban smoking in Casinos--- just saying). The staff was nice enough, so at least they have that going for them.

Worst Starbucks I've ever had. I asked for less ice in my coffee so they substitute it with milk. Seriously paid for iced milk

Free wi-fi, quick service, I can get coffee and my morning oatmeal in a flash. It's not rocket science! Prices are higher than your local Starbuck's but that is true of most of the ones located in a casino! Other than that, there is plenty of seating available (even when the line has been out the door) and the keep the place fairly clean.

REVIEW #2:  4 stars  (219 chars)
Great starbucks in Planet Hollywood. It is kind of tuckedaway from the hustle an bustle of the casino, out of view of the dirty pit and concerts. it has a lot of seating and 4 comfy chairs that all have their on outlet.

REVIEW #3:  4 stars  (448 chars)
Holy roadside robbery! ...  ... Coffee: more expensive than the Starbucks even at other hotels in the immediate area. ...  ... Water: Even the airport does not go above $6 for a bottle of water. ...  ... Hmmm, I think I got mugged at the Starbucks.  But the good news is, they donate 5 cents...that's right....5 cents from my $6 water purchase.  : )  Do not save the world all at once Starbucks...you may earn more customers if you do it slowly....

REVIEW #4:  4 stars  (346 chars)
I totally agree with Jess Y. The guy in front of me got charged $1 for tap water. This starbucks had used drink cups everywhere.  I dont get why people don't clean up after themselves. Needs to be cleaned. This starbucks wasnt cooperate so they didnt take my amazon local 20% off. For some reason the prices are higher for starbucks on the strip!

REVIEW #5:  4 stars  (298 chars)
This Starbucks gets 4 stars simply because FREE WIFI inside the casino!!!!!! Want wifi in your hotel room? $13. Venture downstairs to the Starbucks? FREE! You don't even have to buy anything @ Starbucks to mooch off their wifi. Open 24 hours!  ...  ... And...they do not accept Starbucks giftcards.

REVIEW #6:  4 stars  (737 chars)
This Starbucks is expensive and of course the lines are long, but it's to be expected - it's Vegas! There's a location on the casino floor and also one by check-in. I went to the one on the casino floor when I was in Vegas recently and they made my drink wrong and I had to bring it back - the barista who remade it was so nice about it and remade it quickly and perfectly! He was super tall and I remember his name was Adam. He made my morning, he was so nice and so funny! The reason I remember him specifically is because the other two baristas right there were too busy having a conversation about going out the night before and he was the only one paying attention. Thanks for the attentiveness and the best hazelnut macchiato ever!

Typical Starbucks

REVIEW #8:  3 stars  (766 chars)
I hate giving bad reviews. I know is Vagas and some things cost alot. And alot of people trying to get the same thing can take time. And many people there you might be able to clean the place. But, the employees just act like they don't want to be there. The look on their faces when people ordered. Its hard to put it. Its like I had bad vibes from everyone there. I can tell you they weren't the happy smiling Mc Donalds workers.  ... 1. Very slow ... 2. Employees really didn't seem like they wanted to take orders. ... 3. Very dirty. I think people from the casino cleaned it up before the  Star Bucks employees. ... 4. I couldn't see Star Bucks aproving this place being a part of their chain. I would think they should send some one out there to check on them.

REVIEW #9:  3 stars  (334 chars)
It's pretentious, it's inconsistent, and it's a little grimy. It's Starbucks. This location is pricey due to it's location and it's very crowded but it's the typical impatient customers, indifferent employees, and burnt coffee that you'll find at any other Starbucks. To expect otherwise is an effort in futility so lighten up people!

REVIEW #10:  3 stars  (355 chars)
Kind of disappointed that we were charged for water.  I thought all customers are supposed to be disclosed of any additional charges.  I have never been charged for water at a Starbucks.  It was dirty, tables with drinks on them left by lazy customers.  Their wi-fi was not working at all.  Just disappointing.  Too many employees behind the back counter.

REVIEW #11:  3 stars  (408 chars)
The good: quicker than you'd think.  The line may stretch out into the casino, but you'll likely have your drink in 10 min or less. ...  ... The bad: not Starbucks items in the pastry case, so if you were looking for that lemon bread or salted caramel square, you're out of luck, buddy. ...  ... The ugly: nothing, it was quite nice.  They don't take Starbucks cards for payment, though, that might get ugly.

REVIEW #12:  3 stars  (268 chars)
This place is open 24/7 and staff is fairly friendly and efficient, but this place is pretty over priced compare to other starbucks in the area...also they charged us 50 cents for water -___-" I guess only come here if you're in desperate need to caffeine after hours.

REVIEW #13:  3 stars  (626 chars)
This Starbucks is located inside Planet Hollywood.  We came around 10pm and thankfully the place was still open.  Unfortunately, despite having three employees working that night, I still had to wait a while for my drink to be made. The barista was very slow.  One other person ordered ahead of me but somehow I still had to wait 15 minutes for my coffee to be made (it was not a complicated drink). Another person who had ordered a while before me had his drink taken by someone else and they had to remake his drink.  ...  ... There is a lot of seating in this Starbucks. It was clean and comfortable.  Service is just slow.

REVIEW #14:  3 stars  (455 chars)
Waited 10 minutes in line to find out a venti iced coffee breve costs $5.68... same price as a venti iced white mocha? Questionable how that turned out to be. Paying for convenience of a Starbucks on Las Vegas Blvd I guess..... But, they do accept the starbucks gift cards to earn those stars whether it be on your phone or a physical card they take it! Even though the line took forever, the drinks came out fast and I was out in a jiffy after I ordered.

REVIEW #15:  2 stars  (455 chars)
Dude i have never heard of a starbucks with a bad rating untill now.  i wanna give it 2.5 stars.  Just because the line was long and it's not there fault.  I sat on a small nice looking sofa seat untill i looked closer.. its dirty and kinda tore up.  The place does not take the starbucks card for some reason. and my latte was kinda burnt.  maybe just a bad day.. well from all the review and the star rating it been a bad forever.  oh i didn't get wifi.

REVIEW #16:  2 stars  (712 chars)
I'm really happy there's a Starbuck's downstairs at Planet Hollywood but I'd be much happier if I didn't have to pay a premium for my morning caffeine fix.  For what I paid for a tall drip I could have had two grandes at my local Starbucks.   ...  ... Always crowded in the morning but not so much in the afternoons. There were three baristas at the cash registers at 7 am. While the line moved relatively quickly (I don't consider a ten minute wait too long btw) I was rushed in ordering and forgot to get anything to eat.  Maybe I should be glad as I can only imagine what they charge for scones.   ...  ... They did provide those tray / carriers which made my carrying the coffee back to my room a lot easier.

REVIEW #17:  2 stars  (167 chars)
LOOOOOOOOONG Wait just to get served.  As the line was way into the casino, I see a Starbucks Employee stocking shelves.  Understaffing leads to poor customer service.

REVIEW #18:  2 stars  (279 chars)
PACKED, cramped and long lines.   ... There is cake and muffin crumbs all over the floor. the tables are piled with dirty empty coffee cups. ... It is crazy how much people will do or attempt to do for a starbucks. Wait in an endless line for a less than sub-par cup of coffee...

REVIEW #19:  2 stars  (649 chars)
Stayed at Planet Hollywood for four nights, with no in room coffee pot you have no choice but to buy at one of the 2 Starbucks (or get room service$$$)  This Starbucks is a total rip off!  High prices!  Long lines!  Mediocre service!  Out of Blonde roast within first hour of opening at 6am and barista was not real interested in putting more on to brew.  They ran out of Awake tea.  They advertise hot breakfast sandwiches/rolls but none available during our stay.  We could not use our Starbucks phone app to pay or accumulate points because they were having "technical issues"  Living in WA state the home of Starbucks, we were VERY disappointed!

REVIEW #20:  2 stars  (814 chars)
There's three different ways I've judged the different Starbucks locations over the years. ...  ... 1.  Speed of service ... 2.  Quality of their brewed iced coffee ... 3.  Friendliness of the staff ...  ... This Starbucks was the definition of mediocrity.  The baristas were numerous during the day time, but everyone still had to wait an extended period of time for their drinks. ...  ... Their iced coffee was okay, perfectly acceptable.  ...  ... Their staff, at least the one who rang me up, was not the friendliest.  She dropped a couple of pennies that I gave to her on the floor, and then had the gall to think I short changed her.  Minor transgression, but definitely a little annoying. ...  ... One plus though, is that they have very different pastries, much more upscale than the normal Starbucks fare.

REVIEW #21:  2 stars  (149 chars)
Very understaffed. Long lines. And the pastries and drinks are way overpriced. $3.50 for a small cup of regular Joe. They do take Starbucks card now.

REVIEW #22:  2 stars  (519 chars)
Who the hell charges a dollar for a cup of water?? If I'm ordering coffee and snacks, why would you charge a dollar for a cup of water... It's not the money factor, but more of the principle behind it all.. The starbucks around my neighborhood offer water without hesitation or charge... I just found it ridicules that they asked to pay for it...  ...   This place seems to always be busy- but what else can you expect from a starbucks in vegas? I'll give them one thing though, they had delicious looking fruit snacks.

REVIEW #23:  1 stars  (587 chars)
Dirty. Expensive. Not owned by Starbucks themselves... they are privately owned which is why they do not accept Starbucks gift cards as payment. ...  ... They did run my Gold Card through however, since it's not really part of the actual Starbucks company, they did not honor my Gold Card benefits.  ...  ... They did have some cute pastries... but those are not your typical Starbucks treats. Save your coffee addictions for a small business/ privately owned coffee shop instead of these wannabe Starbucks. My $5 tall sized Carmel Macchiato did not taste like Carmel Macchiato at all...

REVIEW #24:  1 stars  (553 chars)
Inside Planet Hollywood. i ordered 4 drinks. got 3. after waiting and seeing a few people that was in line behind me get their drinks, i went up to the barista and asked if my ice venti carmel macc on the way. the barista seemed disinterested, lucky i had my reciept this morning, normally i dont ask for a reciept.  but he (Adam?) seemed to not care, he finally made the drink after making some other drinks. i would have at least expected an apology, or for them to rush my drink since they made me wait. horrible.  this happened 5/29/2013 at 9:56 am.

REVIEW #25:  1 stars  (1358 chars)
It was a Saturday morning around 10:30 and the girlfriend and I needed coffee in a serious way.  Unfortunately our search for a cup of joe brought us to the Starbucks inside the Planet Hollywood.  This Starbucks just off of the casino floor is the coffee shop equivalent to your average DMV branch...a long line of customers served inefficiently and ineffectively by an incompetent and/or indifferent staff.  The line of people was approximately 25-30 deep.  After five minutes, the line hadn't budged and not a single customer that I could tell had been served their drinks.  I'm not sure whether this lack of progress was due to insufficient staffing or everyone was ordering some complex drink that required each coffee bean to be hand-picked and roasted on the premises. Needless to say since I only wanted a cup of coffee, no cream or sugar, this wasn't going to work.  We left frustrated in search of another Starbucks or similar place to get a good cup of coffee. ...  ... Of note:  Word has it that this Starbucks doesn't accept the Starbucks card.  I believe it since the Starbucks at Harrah's doesn't accept the card either.  What a crock!   ...  ... Avoid this Starbucks like the plague.  Your chance of getting a cup of coffee in the morning in a reasonable amount of time is less than your chance of hitting the jackpot on the progressive slots!

REVIEW #26:  1 stars  (968 chars)
Order takers are rude and don't listen. Ordered a walnut muffin, and she punched in banana. Asked to have it warmed up but alas, No microwave to heat your muffin. Must be hard getting help in Vegas. However barista made a good Upside down nonfat CM. But the rest of the crew needs to pay attention. Hey, I'm from another country too. This Starbucks is in the Planet Hollywood Hotel. ...  ... OK next day 2/3/2011 gave them a second chance, it is the year of the rabbit afterall,  this time my coffee was completely wrong. Ordered it upside down again and watched her put the shots in wrong. Then she calls out it is upside down, I told her it wasn't but she ignores me and doesn't want to make it again. Lowered my rating further. I visit every Starbucks no matter where I am and this is the worst. Starbucks needs to hire secret shoppers and get rid of those who really don't want to work. If you dont want to pour coffee, go do something else, it is Vegas after all.

REVIEW #27:  1 stars  (514 chars)
There is a big sign that says "Free Wi-Fi" on the wall.  ... I came here on Monday and the Wi-Fi did not work. I thought that it was just temporary. ... I came here on Tuesday and the Wi-Fi still didn't work.  ... I came here on Wednesday and the Wi-Fi didn't work.  ... Eventually I came to the conclusion that these people were pissing me off.  ...  ... This is a scam set up so you pay $13.99 for Planet Hollywood's wi-fi service.  ...  ... Not to mention that the prices are like double of a regular starbucks.

REVIEW #28:  1 stars  (458 chars)
This is located inside the Planet Hollywood, downstairs, and right in front of the valet and hotel registration area. ...  ... SLOWEST SERVICE EVERRR... ...  ... Valet said it would take 20 minutes to retrieve my car, so i had to kill time somehow. Looked around, saw SB, and there was only 7 people in line. Little did i know that it would take 20 minutes to get my coffee! ...  ... Small fruit cup = $5, OUCH. ...  ... Don't come here if you're in a hurry.

REVIEW #29:  1 stars  (210 chars)
This Starbucks has a huge sign stating it now serves breakfast. After waiting in line for 10 minutes on 2 occasions, I was told "the delivery didn't arrive". They simply advertise something they never have.....

REVIEW #30:  1 stars  (667 chars)
To start off: I've worked at a Starbucks for nearly 3 years. So I know how much things should be and I know when my drink is made wrong. ...  ... My drink is a pretty complicated one and I get it, easy to mess up. But the guy ringing me up didn't hear me right and so he wrote down the wrong thing, therefore causing the girl making it to screw it up. And I was charged double what I should've been charged. Maybe because it's Vegas? ...  ... Whatever. I paid too much for a crap drink. Good thing I don't live on Vegas. ...  ... Tourists, stay away! You've been warned. If you need free wifi, go to Earl's Sandwich! The food's awesome and the wifi is free as well :)

REVIEW #31:  1 stars  (177 chars)

If this review was just for the morning crew, it would be a lot higher. They are awesome. However, the afternoon crew is another story. There wasn't any of the Pike roast available when ordered. No worries. Waited a few minutes. And a few minutes more...10 minutes go by, so up to the counter we go. When asked if the coffee was ready, the barista says "oh..yeah." And starts pouting it. He had completely forgotten about it and apparently forgot that it was paid for as he started talking crap as we were leaving. A few other customers got their order incorrect as we were waiting too. Maybe less time chit chatting at the counter and a little bit more time focusing on your customers would help.

REVIEW #2:  1 stars  (2119 chars)
My visit was on 6/12/14: ...  ... I'm appropriately titling this review: "Barista Bull S**t" ...  ... I always wondered why it took this location so long to be accessible on Yelp.com; maybe because they knew what kind of reviews they would get?  usually, I get my drink on the weekends with no hassle or fuss; however, on some occasions I do experience oddities; like this one: ...  ... -My father and I have been coming to this location for well over a year, my dad almost on a daily basis and usually at the same time everyday.  Do you think they would learn his or my name, what drinks we get.....nope!  My wife gets treated totally different by the Manager and staff when she goes in for coffee; why aren't we? ... The manager spends most of the time gossiping among her cronies, all except one of which is a man.   ...  ... This is one example of the nonsense that goes on behind the counter: ...  ... **** A fairly butch-looking staff member argued with me about whether the green tea they offered was pure green tea; she exclaimed Yes, it's pure green tea!  (This was before Starbucks offered China Green Tip Tea)  She was referring to a green tea blend with peppermint and other flavors......in no way shape or form is this PURE GREEN TEA!!!   ... **** She ended up giving me "what she thought was pure green tea"....it wasn't. and I was really pissed at the fact that she argued with me, insisted she knew what she was talking about, and eventually was proven incorrect.  I told her I was recently at a Starbucks in China where they offered pure green tea; she said that's not possible.  I've noticed the staff (ladies) are only friendly to a select few customers; however, I believe it all stems from what the manager allows, and she seems to happily support this behavior.   ...  ... On another note:  The new furniture is very uncomfortable when compared to their previous lounge-type furniture. ...  ... ***By the looks of the previous reviews, I would say they're spot on and that this location has some "personal" improvements to make to improve customer service and consistency regarding their products.

REVIEW #3:  1 stars  (1783 chars)
So I visit this store at least once a day while I am at work, sometimes twice a day, so I thought things could only get better........ I guess I couldn't have been more wrong :-/  ... So I have long since given up on them learning my name (at least at this store) and as for memorizing my drink, I guess that's certainly out of the question, because we all know how hard it is to remember a Grande black coffee!! I rarely order anything else, because when I do they always seem to get it wrong. For some reason this store can't seem to understand what you mean when you order "non-fat" and then when you correct them on it, they get upset that they have to remake your drink.  ... But today was the creme de la creme of crappiness at this location! I went in and ordered my usual Grande black coffee, and the barista told me that they didn't have any brewed, so he started brewing some and then charged me the $2.11. He then proceeded to help the next few people in line and of course he completely forgot about my coffee. So about 10 minutes later I went back up to the counter and asked if my coffee was ready and he said "oh yeah" and he poured my coffee and then instead of giving me my coffee, he proceeded to to walk over to another barista and have a random chat with her while holding my coffee?! When he finally did make his way to the counter, I grabbed my coffee and started to walk out. It was at that point he began talking to the other baristas and the people in line about how I didn't pay for my coffee!!!  Was he actually serious!! I only wished he hadn't wasted my whole entire lunch break waiting for my coffee because I would have tore into him!  ... Dear tall barista at Sbux thanks for being such a jerk today and ruining my lunch break!  ... WORST SBUX EVER!!!

REVIEW #2:  5 stars  (523 chars)
I was so tired and just wanted a green tea latte instead of a cocktail, and lo and behold, there was Starbucks, like a green beacon of light with her mermaid tail shimmering in the sea. The workers were both really nice and made my drink perfectly to order and nice and hot. It kept me awake while watching a four hour baseball game in Yard House. Yes, it is a little more expensive here than freestanding Starbucks, but what are you going to do? Located off the casino floor and pretty convenient to the rest of the place.

REVIEW #3:  5 stars  (421 chars)
So awesome to have two Starbucks in the same casino!! Talk about heaven!! The line can get pretty long so I would go there early.   The workers are polite as in all Starbucks and my tall no foam latte was perfect as always.  One thing is that they have pastries but no breakfast sandwiches so I was bummed about that.  I try to do a high protein breakfast and I got none of that in this Starbucks.  But I still love them!

REVIEW #6:  3 stars  (811 chars)
A nice little casino lobby Starbucks with never much of a waiting line.  That is a rarity these days...being able to go right up to the counter and place your order.   ...  ... The staff here is always very nice and they always get your order right.  They also offer some pastries and goodies that most of the other Starbucks locations don't usually stock and offer, so that's another plus.  The prices here, along with the food court one, are a tad bit higher than your usual run of the mill location.  But that's what one should pretty much expect when inside a nice casino. ...  ... There's no seating, you just get your coffee and go.  But that's fine with me, I'm usually here after getting a meal or before hitting the casino floor to do a little gambling.  In either case I'm ready to grab my cup and go.

REVIEW #7:  3 stars  (565 chars)
Every casino food court needs a Starbucks, and this one in Red Rock's food court does not disappoint.  You'll find all your familiar and favorite drinks here, and their pastry section is actually bigger and offers more than most other Starbucks.  The prices are a little more, but it's in a casino so that's just part of the game I suppose. ...  ... Sometimes the line gets pretty long...it's in the heart of the casino and food court so that's pretty much to be expected I suppose.  But the workers are all nice and efficient so they keep the line moving smoothly.

I'm grateful for this Starbucks location especially if I'm going to the movies after a long day at work, I need the caffeine. The down side is the staff isnt very friendly. The barista gave me the death stare. Umm sorry you're having a bad day mr. Barista man?

REVIEW #9:  3 stars  (311 chars)
This is not the most efficient location, as far as getting the drinks out in a timely manor, but it will do. It's located close enough to the sports book that you can load up on caffeine while your watching the game. ...  ... Oh, as usual, you should expect to pay more because this location is inside a casino.

REVIEW #10:  1 stars  (543 chars)
I am a Starbucks fan for sure, but this location is certainly not worth your time! ...  ... Eek! I visited this Starbucks and ordered my usual drink...Big mistake! Bad customer service, nasty employees, long line and massively over priced! The employees roll their eyes and sigh, the female employees often run around with their hair sloppily falling out of ponytails or braids. The employees seem annoyed that they should have to take your order. I would suggest purchasing your Starbucks before or after your trip to Red Rock Casino. 1 Star.

REVIEW #11:  1 stars  (901 chars)
I don't even want to give this star. I'm a local here and couldn't believe the people they had working here. I went down to have some coffee before hitting the spa this morning. I wanted to refill my gold card but I didn't think they could do that so I asked anyways. Always better to ask, right? Well the lady who helped me had said no and the the lady next to her proceeded to mock me in front of me! I thought to myself oh well I would hate to be up this early and dealing with tourists. But as they were making my coffee it seemed to be every customer was getting very poor service.  ... In the end my coffee was completely wrong. And i do understand it's a "fast" coffee place but being a gold card holder I have been to many Starbucks. Aria Starbucks workers know me by name and order. They are absolutely wonderful! So I am inclined to leave my review because it was pretty horrible. Be warned!

I love Starbucks! Especially when there is one inside of the hotel I'm staying at, even more after $10 all you can drink at the bar! They are quick and friendly, and they don't ask why your wearing sunnies inside the hotel, I think they just figure I am hung over. I love that they have seating inside and items you can buy like normal Starbucks. I will come back for my caffeine fix next time I'm staying at the hotel.

I wrote a review and couldn't figure out how to post it.  Silverton Casino Starbucks is really nice.  It has great drinks, electric plug in's They didn't hurry you out.  They even gave samples of new drinks.

REVIEW #3:  5 stars  (188 chars)
It's great! Not only is it a great hotel/casino, but Silverton offers a Starbucks right in the lobby. Get your fix and then enjoy the huge aquarium while you nurse that throbbing headache.

REVIEW #4:  4 stars  (91 chars)
Good service with a friendly staff.  Right inside the Silverton and they even have seating.

This is the best starbucks we went to in vegas. The staff was quick and friendly and drinks were perfect.

REVIEW #6:  4 stars  (391 chars)
This Starbucks was just what I needed last night when I went to the Silverton.  I had my quad espresso and was out of the place very quickly.  The service was great! ...  ... I like that they take the Gold Card from Starbucks.  Some casino locations are still way behind the times when it comes to using the card. ...  ... The seating area is large.  This is a little oasis at the Silverton.

Es gibt in Las Vegas die traditionellen Themen-Hotels (u.a. Bellagio, Caesars Palace, The Venetian, Paris, Grand MGM) und neue Hotels, die keinem Thema frnen sondern einzig aus sich heraus wirken. Das sind die top-modernen, in denen an nichts gespart wurde und die dadurch in anderer Weise ebenso imposant sind wie die Traditionshotels. Zu diesen Neuen gehrt das Aria, das sich im neuen City Center am sdlichen Ende des Strips befindet. ... Modernste Architektur, viel Glas bestimmen das Aria. Drauen im Vorfahrbereich beeindruckt eine geschwungene Wand, von der in unterschiedlichen Intervallen und Strken Wasser hinunter strmt. Die lange Rezeption schirmt sich angenehm vom Casino-Bereich ab, bei meinem krzlichen Besuch war der gesamte Deckenbereich des Empfangs mit groen Weihnachtskugeln dekoriert. ... Die Zimmer vom Feinsten. Wir logierten im 39. Stock mit atemberaubenden Blick auf Las Vegas. Grozgig gestaltet, viel Platz, im Bad allerdings wird an der Grozgigkeit ein klein wenig gespart. Aber das ist leise Kritik auf hchstem Niveau. Die Betten ein Traum, im wahrsten Sinne des Wortes. Ich kenne kein Hotel, das vergleichbar gute, exzellente Matratzen hat wie das Aria und die Kopfkissen  hufig ein Schwachpunkt in der Hotellerie  stehen dem in nichts nach. Die sind so gut, dass das Aria diese Matratzenart und die Kissen zum Verkauf anbietet. Fr uns natrlich schwer nach Deutschland zu transportieren und nicht gerade billig. Ein paar Tausend Dollar (je nach Gre) sind pro Matratze hinzublttern! Ansonsten fehlt in den Zimmern nichts, absolut nichts, was den Aufenthalt uerst komfortabel macht. Ich erspare mir das Aufzhlen, es ist alles vorhanden!! ... Ansonsten bietet das Aria alles was das Besucher-Herz erfreut: Ein groe, weite Casino-Anlage, diverse Restaurants, Bars, Shops. Im Auenbereich eine weitlufige Pool-Anlage, die bei unserem Besuch Ende November zum Groteil geschlossen war  off season. Ein Becken war immerhin geffnet, der Bademeister langeweilte sich, das Wasser war angenehm warm, aber die aus den Zimmer mitgebrachten hochwertigen Bademntel erwiesen sich als sehr ntzlich beim Verlassen des Pools. Drei Whirlpools waren ebenso geffnet, eine Erholung bei heiem, sprudelndem Wasser. ... Und wer mit der weiten Welt kommunizieren mchte: Im gesamten Hotelkomplex ist WLan frei. Allerdings muss man sich stndig wieder einloggen, denn nach kurzer Zeit der Inaktivitt ist man raus aus dem Zugang. ... Fazit: Ein Hotel der hchsten Kategorie. Man muss suchen, um etwas zum Bemngeln zu finden und wird kaum fndig werden. Das hat seinen Preis, aber es gibt immer wieder Angebote! Die Lage ist prima zentral. Wohlfhlfaktor garantiert. Fnf Sterne  locker! ... Tipp: Valet-Parking ist kostenfrei.

The line was a little long but the service was great and they had great selections! I got the asian salad for lunch and a coffee that was nice and fresh...good morning accomplished.

REVIEW #3:  4 stars  (631 chars)
I visited this location for the first time today.  It's clearly more popular than any other retail location in the hotel and I suspect there will be another one in the hotel very soon.  This design on this Starbucks is different and seems to incorporate more of the Aria's design elements than you would find in the average Starbucks on the street.  It's a very comfortable space. ...  ... This location get very busy.  When I visited that had 6 people working and we're able to move the line along very quickly and efficiently. ...  ... They got my order right and had it prepared for me quickly.   ...  ... I was not disapointed.

REVIEW #4:  4 stars  (1018 chars)
Located at CityCenter in the Aria hotel, this is one of a handful of "concept" Starbucks, specially-designed stores that are often very green and artistic.  I was anxious to visit and see for myself.   ...  ... To find this Starbucks, take the escalator up from the casino to the promenade level, where it is near the guest elevators.  ...  ... This is a busy place, and the long line made me hesitate.  But cleverly efficient, they had an employee go down the line, taking your order in advance.  This speeded the line wait dramatically, so it was well under 10 minutes.  Obviously they have taken reviews like Andrew N's to heart. ...  ... I like this location.  Unusual ceiling, nicely tiled columns, attractive tables and chairs, made this a pleasant stopping place.  From a design standpoint, I do prefer the other two CityCenter Starbucks, one in the Crystal Mall and the other near the Mandarin Oriental.  That's not taking anything away from this one, which is obviously a cut above.  Definitely worth a visit.

REVIEW #5:  4 stars  (196 chars)
This is a great Starbucks if you go during off-peak hours. They seem to not be set up to handle a ton of traffic unless you like lines. But, the afternoons are great as this is an empty Starbucks.

REVIEW #6:  3 stars  (447 chars)
Hate waiting in lines? Can you handle a 3 min walk instead of standing there?  ...  ... Ok - so do yourself a favor - walk past this Starbucks down the 2nd floor hall, past the Aria Buffet, go down the escalator on the left, head right towards the exit towards self parking. Back up the short escalator, bang a right, take the walkway and long escalator down towards Monte Carlo, and at the bottom there will be an empty Starbucks waiting for you.

REVIEW #7:  3 stars  (764 chars)
Starbucks has always been pretty consistent with my drinks.  I don't think I have ever had a bad one here.   ...  ... It's basically the customer service I receive is what I review of which I had ok service at this location.   Being on the strip, it is definitely a busier location.  There was somewhat of a line but it moved along fine.  That's probably why it took just a little bit longer to get my drink.  Since they were so busy there wasn't much interaction with the customers.  I've seen busy locations which handled it much better. ...  ... I will say their dining area was very clean.  It has a huge wall of windows which brightened up this area very nicely.  It doesn't hurt that the windows face the main strip so you can people watch here all day long.

REVIEW #8:  3 stars  (320 chars)
They charge higher prices than most Starbucks.  Coffee is the same as other Starbucks, so no issues there.  Food is another matter.  We arrived near opening time one day, and they had no bagels, and one other day they did not have the raisin bagels.  I didn't think that I would have had some a hard time finding bagels.

REVIEW #9:  2 stars  (369 chars)
Employees are nice, but prices are double any other Starbucks that I've ever been to. The also don't have a Starbucks card scanner. If you're going to charge crazy prices at least have good technology. Last time I get Starbucks at Aria. ...  ... *after coming back the next day it appears they double charged me, but I'll never know since they didn't give me a receipt.

REVIEW #10:  1 stars  (239 chars)
Coffee good as usual but incredibly long lines and slow service.  Almost seemed like there was something wring with their POS system.  Staff seemed frustrated too and weren't too friendly.  Plenty of other Starbucks nearby, avoid this one.

REVIEW #11:  1 stars  (701 chars)
Slowest moving Starbucks I have ever encountered in my entire life. ...  ... Avoid this Starbucks on the promenade level. Every morning when I would go to the fitness center I had to pass this Starbucks. There was always a line. ...  ... I decided to wait in the line not thinking it would take long. Oh boy was I wrong. I waited almost a half hour before I reached the cash register. It's not that there are a lot of people waiting on the line, it's the fact that there is only one person taking your order and two people making the coffee. They need more people working behind the counter. ...  ... Prices are much higher here than other Starbucks, but I expect that since it is located in the Aria.

REVIEW #12:  1 stars  (166 chars)
Worst service if any Starbucks. Waited in line 35 minutes to place an order, and they still managed to get it wrong. Not worth it. Next time sticking to room service.

Can't really go bad here. They know what I want when I walk in the door. Thanks girls !

REVIEW #2:  5 stars  (287 chars)
Newest Starbucks on the Strip! It is located conveniently at the Linq between the Quad and Flamingo. This Starbucks offers plenty of seating as well as charging areas. There's free wifi from the Linq. There's also a restroom. Love the iced caramel macchiato and cranberry oatmeal cookie.

REVIEW #3:  5 stars  (345 chars)
This was the first time visiting the new Starbucks at the Linq.   They were one of the few stores that were staffed appropriately for a three day weekend, plus it being Valentine's Day.   The cashier introduced herself, reviewed the order, and was friendly as could be.  Way to go Starbucks for training these employees to delight their clients.

REVIEW #4:  4 stars  (653 chars)
Despite how busy this Starbucks gets, and how often it has long lines, service is still fast and friendly here. Long lines usually clear up really quickly.. ...  ... It's almost also like a little quiet familiar safe haven, hidden away from the noise, flashing lights and smoke of the gambling floor, even though it's just steps away. ...  ... Being Las Vegas, iced coffees and frapp's make up the majority of the menu items purchased here, and every iced coffee I've had there was excellent! Just the right amount of ice. I'm pretty used to other Starbucks putting so much ice in their iced coffees, that even with a venti you're done after two slurps.

REVIEW #5:  4 stars  (553 chars)
In the land where the people are awake at ALL times, and most Starbucks are PACKED, this location is a hidden treasure.  ...  ... A LARGE location, with more than enough sitting space, a staff that knows what they are doing AND has their processes DOWN?!?! YES PLEASE. ...  ... The line has never been out of control, and they keep it flowing at a decent pace. They take your order before you even get near the register so by the time you are done so is your drink. Truly a great location, and makes getting hangover nourishment speedy and less painful.

REVIEW #6:  4 stars  (1131 chars)
When I am on the Strip and want to slow down or get away from the adult beverages, Starbuck's is my place. Actually Starbuck's is always my place. ...  ...   The Starbuck's at the Linq is the newest Starbuck's on the Strip. Technically it is in the new Disneyfied street called the Linq that will lead people from the mid-Strip along a walkway that resembles Bourbon Street past bars and entertainment venues to the High Roller Ferris Wheel. It is between the Flamingo, O Shea's and Quad entrances. In other words it is hyper convenient. ...  ...    There are countless Starbuck's on the Strip. This one is different because it looks like you are entering a building off Bourbon Street. It is the anti-casino Starbuck's with the casino pricing. ...  ...   Inside the Starbuck's is modern. There are plenty of seating. The sun does not heat up the cafe. And in the age where the smartphone is practically a body appendage, there are plenty of phone outlets. ...  ...   When I hang out on the Strip, sometimes I just want to relax with a cup of coffee. I enjoyed relaxing in the newest Strip Starbuck's enjoying a non adult beverage.

REVIEW #7:  3 stars  (543 chars)
HOLY TAMOLE!! Are my eyes deceiving me?  Did I really read these prices right??  In need for a major refresher while walking the hot Vegas strip, we wandered into the Linq and came across Starbucks.  The prices here are crazy expensive!! - I want to say about 3 times more than what a standard Starbucks would charge.  So, I would probably say, unless you are SUPER desperate, I would probably go somewhere else to get your drink.  Unfortunately, I was desperate and had to shell out the cash for my drink!  You are paying for the convenience.

REVIEW #8:  3 stars  (160 chars)
One of the nicest Starbucks I've been to, as well as the most natural-light one too.  Tall ceilings, with wooden theme design. ...  ... Props for open 24 hours.

REVIEW #9:  3 stars  (924 chars)
This is one of the newest Starbucks located on the strip, but it's not a real one, but a Starbucks in name only.  ...  ... Yes they except the Starbucks gift card, but they also except the total rewards cards which makes it not an official Starbucks. Another giveaway is they jack up the prices! ...  ... I ordered a passionfruit iced tea with a splash of strawberry. Normally my drink would cost me about $2.85. The young lady told me my drink cost almost 6 dollars. I did not question them, I just gave them my Starbucks card and took my drink. ...  ... This place is pretty big, plenty of outlets to plug-in, and plenty of selection of other items including the "you are here" Vegas mugs, juices, sandwiches, etc.  ...  ... I'm giving this place three stars because of the outrageous price increase. I understand it's a business, but doubling the price for a drink that normally cost me less than three dollars is insane.

REVIEW #10:  1 stars  (208 chars)
Rudest Starbucks I've been to. Paid $7.50 for coffee. You'd think you get a 'thank you' at the register right? Nope! Top it off the drink was ready, got place on counter called name and straw thrown. Lol wow!

This Starbucks and the Staff is absolutely amazing! I went in twice to get Green Tea and wasn't sure if I usually get the China Green Tips or the Zen tea, both times, two different associates suggested the Zen tea and told me that if I didn't like it they would make me the China Green tips, no questions asked.  ...  ... They were friendly, quick, and attentive. All of which were essential to rejuvinating during a long weekend in Vegas. The location is ideal, it is open 24/7, and there was hardly ever a line, but when there was, it moved quickly. They also have a lot of pastires that most locations do not have... extra win!

REVIEW #4:  4 stars  (219 chars)

I was lucky.. no line!  Stopped here before the Beatles Love show, and was happy they took my Starbuck gold card. Good service, and I can't complain.

REVIEW #6:  4 stars  (1041 chars)
If u need to plug in your MacBook or George Foreman grill, you might have to wait because they only have 2 outlets. Other than that, it's a nice place to people watch if you get a seat by the windows. A little noisy cuz its right next to the casino floor. Lines can be long, but they are fast with getting orders out. They do take your Starbucks card. ...  ... To gain better reviews, keep prices on par with the rest of the world, add more plugs, and install an exit door to keep out some noise near the tables. It would be hard to make an entrance door because the line to get a chai latte is sometimes too long. ...  ... Sadly, I expect the prices to be more at the casino. What does that tell you? Mine (and most everyone else's) perception of casinos is not a good one. My perception of Starbucks is also starting to diminish because THEY ALLOW IT. Why does Starbucks allow casinos to jack up prices to greedy levels? For someone not a regular at starbucks, they will leave feeling like Tasha D. Casinos are giving Starbucks a bad name.

REVIEW #7:  4 stars  (664 chars)
It's winter time and it's FREEZING while walking down the Strip.   It was easy to find this starbucks because it wasn't hidden within the hotel shopping centers, and I thank it for that.  All I got was a hot peppermint Mocha (The Holiday flavors were supposed to be over by this time, but they let me order it.).  It was the absolute perfect hand warmer and treat.   ...  ... Lately most of the starbucks I've been to don't really ask for names anymore to write on cups, which makes me kinda sad.  But this place asked for names.     ...  ... It was funny to see my friend name (Joey) become "Joye."  They didn't misspell my name, which honestly saddened me a bit.

REVIEW #8:  4 stars  (375 chars)
Of course I had to come to a Starbucks while in Vegas. Duh. It was your average Starbucks - they weren't as friendly as other Starbucks I have been to, but they were not rude. It's pretty small - they have a few places to sit down, but that's about it. A good place to come if you was to get coffee to go. Everything else was the same as every other Starbucks I have been to!

Courteous and fast moving line helps to keep away the angry but sluggish monster lying in wait within me. I am not always hyped up on caffeine, but my breakfast was a huge let down and I was getting cranky.  ...  ... I needed a pick me up and was feeling overwhelmingly warm. What does that call for? An Iced Americano. I cannot complain about their standard version of my preferred drink. It is strong enough to perk me up, but average.  ...  ... The staff are quick to get the drinks out and friendly, so it is a decent option in the Fashion Show.

REVIEW #11:  3 stars  (1127 chars)
It pains me to give them three stars because of who they are.  I would much rather frequent a local coffee shop over a corporate chain any day, but this was Vegas.  You won't see me checking into many Starbucks very often.  This particular one was located on the main floor of the Mirage (our hotel).   ...  ... I ran down virtually every morning at the crack of dawn to score us a couple doses of caffeine.  In this particular venue - it was imperative that you go early because after 7-730AM....the lines were ridiculous.  I will say that the line did seem to go fast the one time I had to stand in it. ...  ... That being said - it's Starbucks.  Same sh*t - different venue.  This venue was small, relatively cramped and again had an immense amount of volume in the early AM hours.  That line was solid until well into the late morning hours.  The service and finished product was fine.  I do enjoy sprucing up my latte or whatever toots my horn.  There were a handful of other Starbuck locations nearby as well so if hooked on SB - check out those venues as they might not have the massive lines like the one at the Mirage.

REVIEW #12:  3 stars  (152 chars)
Nice to have a familiar coffee shop.  The higher prices is expected but not the service.  Very slow service when we were here.  Only one person working!

REVIEW #13:  3 stars  (368 chars)
What can I say... It's Starbucks, they have this place down to a system, guy who takes your food order, guy who takes you coffee order, guy who rings you up. You will probably be in the photos of many German families who are taking photos of this American institution. Just outside the front door of Treasure Island so very convenient for the morning walk of shame ;-)

REVIEW #14:  2 stars  (288 chars)
"Way over priced..not usual Starbucks prices nationwide!" ...  ... $10.99 for a sandwich that is $4.99 in most every other Starbucks?? I realize rent in the Mirage las Vegas is probably high..but your volume is huge. Should offset. Coffees were way more expensive as well. Still we paid..

This is the most expensive Starbucks I've ever been to!  It was over $10 for: a drip coffee, an apple, a yogurt, and a chocolate bar.  Bleh.  Also super slow service.  But friendly.  I wouldn't complain except for the toxic sticker shock.

REVIEW #17:  1 stars  (515 chars)
First off the girl didn't even greet us when we reached the register to order. I paused not knowing if she was still concluding the order before mine, but then realized as she was staring at me that she was waiting for me to order. Alright, you love your job don't u?! Then, after i ask for my bagel to be toasted, she bluntly tells me we dont toast.  What?! This Starbucks doesn't have a toaster... Epic fail Starbucks. All of your stores should be consistent in the services they are able to offer your customers.

REVIEW #18:  1 stars  (289 chars)
I go to Starbucks ALL the time and I'll never go back to this one. First, they got my order wrong, then gave ME attitude for it. The girl in the front was really nice and that's about it. There are a million other Starbucks in Vegas, first and last time I go to this one. TERRIBLE service.

REVIEW #20:  1 stars  (519 chars)
Terrible Starbucks.  Usually SBUX gets 5 stars from me, but at this location they had a crew of sloppy employees.  My wife and I had to tell them our drink order three times since they were not paying attention the first time and on the second time they made her drink incorrectly.  My coffee was luke-warm.  Last time I ever go to this Starbucks.  The employees were goofing off and laughing about their inside jokes even after they made our drink incorrectly.  One star from me.  Would be 0 stars if it was available.

REVIEW #21:  1 stars  (342 chars)
The ONLY good thing to say is that they serve fresh coffee... ... Other than that, the staff is rude, the coffee is about $2.00 higher for Venti than a normal Starbucks and they don't give you stars when you buy their over priced coffee! ...  ... The Walgreens across the street is a good alternative, with fresh coffee and and a lower price.

This is my second review on yelp and I have to do it. Chris (the cashier is soooo rude) ... I put a bottle of izzue orange soda on the counter while I was taking my card out of my purse. Suddenly the bottle fell on the floor and I was frightened( the bottle is made of glass). One attentive staff asked me whether I got hurt, which luckily I was okay. ... But when I ordered again, Chris charged me for the orange soda which fell on the floor from his counter ( I didn't touch the bottle at all when it was placed on the counter!) I was like WTF! He didn't ask if I was okay but instead charging me without telling me! ( my bf found the total number was wrong and checked it) ...  ... The attentive staff who cleaned the piece of glass told him not to charge for the broken one( 4 dollars) ...  ... I was so annoyed that I just took the cash he returned to me, thought it would be 4 dollars. ...  ... However, on my way back to room, my bf counted the money and found it was only 2 dollars!!! I didn't really care the the 4 dollars but the whole thing was just ridiculous !!! ...  ... Starbucks at Mirage should train the staff!!!! ...  ... Chris, I don't know what's wrong with you, but working in a customer service industry, you should at least respect and do you job!!!!

I got a sandwich here that tasted fine. I really just wanted water for the dehydration but they wanted to charge me. I went with their small cup without a lid. That was free.

Guess what whiny babies - chains that are in or connected to a casino generally cost more than the usual. Just like it is at the airport. Sucks, but just don't buy it if you don't like the prices. I wish you luck finding a cheaper latte on the strip.  ...  ... It's a typical starbucks and yes slightly more expensive than the usual, but you're overpaying regardless, so what's a little more right? Employees were funny and friendly, place was clean. And strip locations are usually exempt from cheap deals, but yay for half off frapps during happy hour 3-5pm thru May 10th.

I have been craving green tea lattes like everyday now. ...  ... I visited Las Vegas with my friends the past weekend for EDC. We stayed at TI during this trip. With my never ending craving, having a Starbucks inside TI really helped me out a lot! I just had to go downstairs to get my craving fulfilled. Thank goodness I did not have to go outside in the heat. ...  ... The service is a hit or miss. ...  ... I don't think they serve the hot breakfast sandwiches/wraps on the weekend. I did not see it offered the whole weekend, but then saw it being offered the monday I was leaving.

REVIEW #4:  4 stars  (378 chars)
What can I say. ..a Starbucks is a Starbucks!  That is why they are so popular.  Their product is consistent.  My only complaint--and this for EVERY Starbucks in Vegas is the astronomical prices.  Their items cost almost double what their items cost any where else.  Every Starbucks I entered was completely packed, I can't imagine the price hike is necessary . . . just greedy.

REVIEW #5:  3 stars  (524 chars)
Starbuck's has eliminated the "short" coffee cup at many of its outlets. They have also eliminated the "short" from their cash registers.The barristas complain that this is a company decision. The benefit to the company is obvious: they charge significantly more for the "tall" cups. The damage to the clientele is just as obvious: we pay more for being involuntarily SUPERSIZED and we consume more than we want to, and more than we should. I big fat round of thanks to Starbuck's for contributing to the obesity of America.

REVIEW #6:  3 stars  (635 chars)
This Starbucks is hidden in a back corner of TI (Treasure Island). It's huge, but always, always packed. Because this is the Starbucks of the hotel, it is pretty pricey. Their coffee cake is usually $2.75 but here they charge you $3 each! Imagine...a small piece of coffee cake for $3. I'm not even sure how much they hiked their prices for drinks! However, it is noticeably pricier than other ones.  ...  ... There's free wifi, but you have to ask for the password. Lots of places to sit, and internet's fast but seats aren't that comfortable. Will come back when I stay here again for the wifi, but not so much for the pricey drinks!

REVIEW #7:  2 stars  (794 chars)
I hated this Starbucks. They were 24 hours so I was hopeful they'd be good. The prices of Starbucks in Vegas are almost double the price of Starbucks in NY. I was not happy about that. My barista was also very rude during my first visit. I was waiting at the bar for a regular coffee, when they told me she had to pour it and it wasn't up to the baristas making the drinks to pour it I approached her again. She obviously didn't want to pour my coffee, she was very pissed about it and told her fellow barista she was going to stab her, I was hoping she was only kidding. I work in public service too so I get it, we have good days and bad days but you still shouldn't be rude to the clientele or your co-workers. I did not like this starbucks and was regretful that it was the one by my hotel.

Pricey coffee and food... Compared to other Starbucks... Not even open for 24 hours... This store is located inside Treasure Island Hotel.  One of thier staff told me that their store only serve the sandwich wraps during breakfast only.... Then the following morning I called to check if they still have the sandwich wraps for sale as it is nearing noon.  The store staff said they have it all day.  Huh?  So I guess that male staff on night shift was being lazy then...  This store needs to train their night staff to be more customer friendly...

REVIEW #9:  2 stars  (326 chars)
This is a typical Starbucks located just outside of Treasure Island, but be warned as of November 2013 this location doesn't carry the La Boulange line of pastries nor do they accept the Starbucks app as payment.  Not a bad place to people watch on the Las Vegas Strip though.  Everything else is pretty typical.  That is all.

Both of the baristas were unfriendly and looked angry to have customers show up. She talked in a monotone voice, greeting me with a "What do you want?" while rolling her eyes. Where I live, the Starbucks baristas are always bubbly and seem extra happy. So it irritated me to be around such a negative aura while on vacation.  To make things worse, she overcharged me for my drink which clearly showed a lower price on the menu. She did not give me a receipt either, so there was no way for me to prove that she had overcharged me. The male barista who made my drink kept saying that she charged me the correct price, and it was only more because of tax. My drink was 5.50 and she charged 5.65, with tax that came out to 6.11. That's a very expensive drink and I have never had to pay that much tax at a Starbucks where I live. I was willing to pay the expensive price but the attitudes of the people working there made my experience a bad one. Luckily I will not ever go back there.  ...  ... My drink did taste good in the end, but the customer service was terrible.

Third time in a row, they give me the wrong drink. Employees are rude and it's was more expensive than any other Starbucks.

REVIEW #13:  1 stars  (521 chars)
Worst Starbucks I have been to. Both the barista and the cashier were very rude and not helpful. The store was also not clean, there was garbage on the floor and splatters in the counter. When I asked about rewards and promo codes, I quickly got a dismissive "no we do not do that" they also don't seem to make many drinks being that they told various customers they couldn't make the drink. My experience with this Starbucks pushed me to go to other coffee retailers during my time in Las Vegas. Avoid going if possible.

I'm generally here two times a week before/after hikes.  The crew at this outlet are competent and friendly.  Sometimes, the line gets a little long, but it's not a major factor. ...  ... They used to have a really large seating area, but Albertson's recently redid some of their retail space and now that area is gone and is just a small area along the front wall. ...  ... Sitting on the patio is great.  It's always covered and the tables all have umbrellas.  Even in winter it's usually very pleasant to sit out and people watch.

REVIEW #2:  3 stars  (301 chars)
This location is fine-- It is in the Albertsons and is very small. They do have seating outside and that is nice because it is usually not busy here.  ...  ... They seem to have a lot of different employees here. Not really sure what that is about. But they do have my Chai Latte so I am a happy girl.

REVIEW #3:  3 stars  (863 chars)
This Starbucks opened back in 2008 when I first lived here. My young one was just a wee babe, so it was easy to cart him anywhere. This Starbucks fulfilled my latte, frappachino, and lovely oatmeal cravings every single day. Then my family moved. I missed my next door Starbucks. We moved back her a few months ago. This Starbucks is still the same, but my smart phone has evolved past them. I am so used to just whipping out my iPhone and paying for anything that will let me. This 'Bucks does not. It is a nice place to hang out waiting for other pressing engagements, and the staff can be pretty nice when they are not just "meh". So yes, there are times when I adore my venti, and other times when I wished I'd gone down to Town Center. At least it is near my house. (Oh yeah- they do not take the phone app, so have your physical SB card or another payment.)

REVIEW #4:  1 stars  (463 chars)
Selling water in a desert problem again.  Buy $5.00 coffees for 15 years but when you sweat your balls off walking from your car to the door and just need a water the charge for tap water is $.30.  Less than a mcDonald's dollar for a cup of water. But now I am thinking people with cups all over their car might not be so crazy here.  Must be a nevada policy.  Never had to pay for tap water in california at mcdonalds or starbucks.  A cup does not cost a dollar.

Driving on Lake Mead Boulevard, I saw this Starbuck's, and decided to give it a try. It seems to be an enjoyable Starbucks to hang out in.  ...   With an L-shape foot print, the cafe is commodius. It is clean. The Motown music coming out of the speakers was enjoyable. ...   The baristas seemed to be extraordinarily personable. I overheard them greet a handful of customers by name.

REVIEW #4:  4 stars  (223 chars)

REVIEW #4:  4 stars  (527 chars)
I like this Starbucks because of its convenience off the freeway (215) and the park is across the street walking distance. This Starbucks has outside seating where no smoking is allowed! Yes thank you! ... Not so many chairs to sit down in, also it's sometimes bombarded by kids/young adults-- the library is also down the street which I like- grab my coffee and grab my local latest read for the month!  ... My only miss with this Starbucks is the parking! It's crazy small and always almost full lucky they have a drive thru!

REVIEW #5:  4 stars  (339 chars)
Ive gone to many starbucks and i think ive found one of my favs. I either do the drive through or walk in depending on my time situation. But every time i walk in it seems they always recognize you or know your name. Im new to this neighborhood but its nice to see and know that the staff has the customer service like that. Good job guys.

REVIEW #6:  4 stars  (297 chars)
Lines might seem long in the drive through during the morning rush, and many older locals are often gathered outside chatting and smoking....but the service is great....  They remember your name if you are a frequent patron and usually start ringing up your order when you walk up to the register.

REVIEW #7:  4 stars  (450 chars)
Normally we love the coffee at this Starbucks it is always hot and made correctly. Today however after placing my order at the drive through I asked for a venti ice water, the lady responded by telling me I had to drive back around to receive it because there were too many people behind me......Really!!!! After she registered the look I gave her she changed her mind and got the water. She must be new...Still our favorite Starbucks, we'll be back.

REVIEW #10:  3 stars  (1751 chars)
The greatest luxury at this Starbuck's isn't comfortable seats, complimentary Wi-Fi, or premium coffee. The luxury at this Starbuck's it is across Aliante Parkway from the Aliante Nature Discovery Park duck pond. This is the Las Vegas Starbuck's by the duck pond. ...  ...   Everytime I visited this Starbuck's, it was before or after the duck pond. In the cold winter months, it is nice to quaff a warm coffee after the duck pond or to carry it to the duck pond and wake up with the duckies. In the hot months of summer months it is relaxing to quaff a refreshing Frapucinno after the duck pond or at the duck pond.  ...  ...   When I walk toward the Starbuck's, I could see the 215 and Aliante Station Hotel & Casino. As I type this, Aliante Station is in need of a Starbuck's type of establishment. When the Starbuck's craving hits, this is the go-to location for Aliante Station. The 215 is the dividing wall between Aliante Station and a cup of Starbuck's. It is the furthest Starbuck's eastbound on the north segment of the 215 toward Interstate 15. When I pull into this parking lot I maneuver through the infrastructure of a shopping center. Surrounding Starbuck's is a modern shopping center that includes Smith's,  Arby's, Sierra Gold, 7-Eleven, and a gym. In other words it is a convenient Starbuck's.  ...  ...   Inside, the lobby is always clean when I visit. The lobby is on the small side. This isn't a negative because I could turn it into a positive by drinking my beverage across Aliante Parkway by the duckies. The baristas have been friendly. ...  ...  I appreciate places that are upbeat and give me a caffeine boost. When I visit the duckies at Aliante Nature Discovery Park, I will also be visiting the Green Mermaid-Starbuck's.

Love Starbucks, but this particular location serves coffee that tastes burned 90 percent off the time. Even though this location is the closest to my home, I go out of my way to get coffee from other Starbucks that don't consistently serve burned coffee.

REVIEW #12:  2 stars  (242 chars)
Waited 15 minutes in the drive thru lane with only 4 card ahead of us. They we not apologetic, rather they gave us a few excuses as to why they were so slow. Also forgot our receipt. We are regular customers and were disappointed time around.

REVIEW #13:  1 stars  (367 chars)
Currently still in drive thru line for 30 minutes. No. Joke. Can't exit and blocked in from cars in the front and rear. I'm too tempted to drive over the nice gardening next to the drive thru lane. The only thing keeping me sane is killing time writing this review. As I reach the end if typing this not one car has moved forward. I'm gonna drive thru this gardening.

I can't believe the experience we had here at this specific Starbucks! We came here on Christmas Eve and received an ugly example of attitude that should NOT be seen from an employee and, according to my friend who is employed by Starbucks, completely unacceptable behavior towards fellow Starbucks employees! Here's what happened: ...  ... We were already psyched to go snowboarding.  That psych just wasn't enough so we decided to get some caffeine to boost our psych to whole other level.  We order our drinks and my friend goes to give her "partner number" to receive her discount off of her drinks.  Another employee, possible manager or supervisor, side busts and asks do you have 2 forms of ID. Realizing she left her wallet in the car back at my gf's house, she says oh I forgot my ID, and she proceeds to show her other Starbucks paraphernalia that ONLY Starbucks partners would have.  Now this "supervisor" was talking to her with her back completely turned away, and says to the cashier ringing her up, "It's up to you if you want to believe her" in the ugliest tone of voice! ...  ... Not only was the person completely rude, she did not apologize at all when my friend presented proof that she is a partner with Starbucks! Complete and utter SUCK from this person!

REVIEW #15:  1 stars  (155 chars)
Long drive thru line. Gingerbread Latte tasted so watery I thought they gave me tea. The Caramel Brulee Latte was so strong, tasted more like black coffee.

REVIEW #16:  1 stars  (606 chars)
Slowest Starbucks ever!!! Excuses galore and a snarky window person equals one VERY unhappy customer!!! The window person even told me sarcastically "thank you for your patience" after I has commented on how much time it was taking this morning!!! She rang up the wrong amount, handed me the wrong order and seemed frustrated with ME after I had spent 10 minutes stuck in that line!!! If there had been room for me to skip that line I would have been GONE!! I bit my tongue... Called the manager later and explained that maybe that employee needed extra training regarding her customer service!! Grrrr!!!!!

REVIEW #17:  1 stars  (420 chars)
This is the only Starbucks I've ever been to that refused to blend a cake pop into my frap. The employees are nice, but the manager was clearly stingy and claimed that the entire company changed its policies on the 'secret menu' (which isn't a secret menu, it's just the things Starbucks allows to customize drinks). This is definitely the last Starbucks I would choose to go to despite it being the closest to my house.

Wooohooo, first to review. ... It's a Starbucks but with a little extra of what it should be. ... During the protests this place has been hopping.  Long lines out the door (at least 20 people outside in the cold when were were last there).  The staff was great.  Cheerful, well staffed and well stocked.   Everything tasted good.   The bathroom was very busy and still clean!  Great job guys.  We warmed up there a number of times.  Great view of the square from inside.

REVIEW #2:  4 stars  (681 chars)
I'm on a mission.  ... A mission of love? No.  ... A mission of drinking my way through the Starbucks Secret Menu? Yes. ...  ... And while ordering these highly customized drinks can be quite obnoxious, this particular Starbucks location has always been accommodating to my strange requests.  ...  ... The latest of which was a Twix Frappuccino. I recited that I would like a Caramel Frappuccino with extra caramel and mocha drizzle in the cup, whipped cream blended in, plus one pump of hazelnut, and java chips.  ...  ... Given how calorie dense and wordy these special orders are, I figure I'll have the Secret Menu tackled by the time Starbucks is out of business, whereabouts.

This is the perfect weekend Starbucks. ...  ... While I normally visit the McKee location on my drive to work, this one is perfect for stopping in to get your weekend coffee. They seem to be the Starbucks that gets the new items first, and definitely have one of the best variety in the area. ...  ... Outside tables in the summer and the big long table in the center with "ONWARD" written on it are more highlights.  ...  ... Stopping during summer farmer's market Saturday is a pretty sure occurrence, so I'll be stopping there again soon enough.

REVIEW #6:  3 stars  (554 chars)
Average mass produced coffee...served with a reliable smile.  ...  ... Pluses include daily horoscope, clover coffee and reliable baristas who prep your order while you're in line if you stick to a regular drink.  ...  ... Draw backs are limited outlets and less seating since the remodel.  Avoid the sun by sitting at the common table. If you need an outlet, sit along the bar near the restrooms, at the common table near the column or on the round tables in the back corner along the Capitol side windows. ...  ... Outdoor seating when weather permits.

REVIEW #7:  3 stars  (252 chars)
One thing you have to like about Starbucks is that you get a consistent drink every time. Sometimes though its about how long one needs to wait for this consistence. It's location has been remodeled recently and looks amazing.  ...  ... That is all ...

So slow. So, so slow. The set-up is horrible, too. It is always a great reminder that Madison has numerous other local coffe choices.

REVIEW #9:  2 stars  (467 chars)
Stopped at Starbucks again.  I'm still using up my gift card.  I tried a coffee brewed with their Clover Brewing System.  I was not impressed and felt compelled to remove a star.  What Starbucks created in Seattle is not being replicated thru their exponential growth.  They  have great branding, locations, and marketing, but that's not enough for me.  I suggest Bradbury's coffee house.  They use Kickapoo Coffee's roasted beans.  I think you'll be pleased you did.

I realize there are plenty of local coffee shops in Madison, and I love them too, but this one just happens to be on my way to work AND it has a drive through. Sometimes convenience wins.

REVIEW #3:  4 stars  (720 chars)
Ok so this is a Starbucks, for the most part, like any other starbucks. Specifically to this location, it is expectedly busier than most because it is right on University (hard to miss). Even so there seems to be plentiful seating and staff is efficient give or take some rare occasions. Now the real kicker. This Starbucks has a drive thru! Which is GREAT except that FOR the drive thru is the worst positioned store I have ever seen. People seem to think it is a free-for-all and whoever is closest gets to go; whether you come in through the back entrance or front  I guess its anyones go. Thats why this store doesn't get a full 5 stars. It seem like a tiny thing to worry about but the parking lot is awful as well.

REVIEW #4:  3 stars  (1803 chars)
Drive Through - YIPEEEEEEEE! - 5 Stars. ...  ... The fact that everyone else does this, and by consequence there is a VERY STRONG possibility that you get STUCK in the drive through when it could have taken you less time to park, get out of your car, and order your triple shot cappuccino - BOOOOOOOOO - 1 star. ...  ... The fact that you CAN enter both through University Avenue AND behind the Mobil Gas Station (thus avoiding the hoopla of trying to turn left on University - HOOORAAAAAAAHHH = 5 stars! ...  ... The fact that there's never a cohesive line since there's two drive through entrances, and well.. it could get ugly if people are craving their javas and are trying to manoover their huge ass SUVs and you have a tiny little car that SHOULD be easier but these people are EVIL and vicious and may not let you in accordingly - BOOOOOOOO 1 star. ...  ... The fact that on REPEATED occasions, the !@#$% baristas did NOT know that a triple shot cap was the same as a cap with an extra shot, and wanted to charge me for a latte with two extra shots, and it is PATHETIC when I, the CUSTOMER, has to tell them "Um.. no... A basic cappuccino has TWO shot of espresso.  That's why if I add another one it's called a triple shot.  Look it up!"  (Oh hushie, I say it in a nice way, which probably accounts for my weak coffee.. ) - BOOOOOO 1 star. ...  ... The fact that many times the coffee has been free because of this (they try to overcharge, and after a discussion, I'm right! -  YAY - 4 stars.. ...  ... The fact that they don't know how to make a cappuccino and this makes me wary of the amounts of times that I asked for a cap, and got a latte with foam, then left, and said "DAMN, this coffee is weak", 2 stars. ...  ... I think that averages to three.  Good math skills have I got, you know!

REVIEW #5:  3 stars  (426 chars)
It's Starbucks, not a whole lot else to say. Never had an order messed up there; in fact I got free coffee the other day because my "wait had been too long." Can't go wrong with that! ...  ... You can go wrong if you go here at a busy time, though. The drive-thru has two entrances which can be confusing, and the parking lot is atrocious. It isn't large enough to handle lots of customers parking and going to the drive-thru.

After a terribly long day, I just needed some coffee. I seriously debated going to this location because it is a maze to get back there.  No regrets.   ...  ... This location is hands down the BEST Starbucks I have ever been to.  The line is always long because they are making your drink the way it should be made.  Whether it is a Frappuccino or just a regular cup of coffee this location stands out above the rest.   ...  ... It was on this day that I ordered my standard Grande, Hot, Skim Milk Caramel Mocha with light whip.  It was superb.  No burnt taste, it was fresh, delicious and that sip saved my day.  Yes, it does sound a little dramatic.  I have been studying for the bar and just needed caffeine.  This place gave me flavor and happiness all in one cup.  I wish I could remember a name or give them all a hug.  This is where you go to get a good cup of coffee AND the staff is friendly!

If you know anything about me, you know I LOVE Starbucks. When I was living in Arizona my home was on the same street as 5... FIVE of them. I lead presentations on community building and branding and have PP slides dedicated to them. I just finished a book about habit which had an entire chapter devoted to them. I long for the switch over to the holiday cups each season. I can go on... ...  ... I'll never forget the first time I had Starbcuks. I was in NY with my friend Cari and we were getting hot tix (student discounted tix when you show up at the butt crack of dawn) for The Full Monty. She decided if there was any way we were going to bear the cold and the line, we needed some Buck. I had never had a cup of coffee up until then, told her I was afraid of jumping in with both feet, so I got a Frapaccino, coffee's sweeter cousin... in the dead of winter... in NY. ...  ... Truth be told I don't drink Starbucks as much as I used to. Funny thing about having a job that allows me to celebrate the fine local offerings we have. However, in addition to being a remarkable brand (seriously, do some Googling if you're interested) they also have incredible boxes if you're moving and need to pack up shhhhtuff.  ...  ... This location gets 5 stars because it's by far the cleanest I've been in so far, and the staff is warm and friendly but not overly so. Large tables make it easy to gather/work and ample parking is an added bonus that some of the others don't have.

I'm so happy they opened a Starbucks! The only ones around were either in Target or in Barnes and Noble at the east towne mall. I love how they added the drive through, it makes it quick and easy for me to get what i want and get on with the rest of my day. ...  ... The staff is superb and very friendly. The only downfall i had was that sometimes the staff is a little chatty with the customers which can delay how quick they can be. But overall it was an awesome experience and I'm so happy that Starbucks has it's own building that's easily accessible.

I typically prefer locally owned, independent coffee shops, but the reason I come back to this particular Starbucks is because of the staff. The baristas have all been incredibly kind, courteous, and patient with customers--including myself--and even though I usually steer clear of corporate cafes, I now make it a point to duck into this location whenever I'm on the west side of Madison for work.

Came in this morning and was greeted by a very friendly employee at the counter with a "Happy Wednesday!"

I have been coming to this Starbucks quite a bit and for a long period of time. It is a nice quiet and smaller Starbucks on the west side. They always have everything brewed on time and they get your order quickly. It's generally cleanly and have some nice coffee-related products always stocked generously. The only thing I dislike about this particular store is the seating. For some reason people go there and take the bigger tables for just one person or take up one of the "comfy chairs" without purchasing anything just to sit... I know its a free country but come on... anyways, It is still a place I come back to regularly and probably will always.

REVIEW #6:  3 stars  (1267 chars)
I come in to read the paper and get coffee on Sunday mornings.  I have had pretty good service here during my past visits.  The partners are friendly, know the product (a result of the excellent training they get), and are willing to make drinks that had been on the menu but are no longer on the menu with similar ingredients.  Today was different.  The one working at the counter was probably 10 to 15 years older than most of the baristas and she sure was short tempered.  She tried charging me the full $2.50 for the paper, when it's only $2 at Starbucks.  She also didn't manage the line well.  The barista who may have been a supervisor told her to charge me the correct price and was far more pleasant.   ...  ... What bought it down to three stars was an older woman pushing a walker sitting down across from me without even asking me if that was okay.  First, she's old enough to know that it's polite to ask someone if they are fine with you sharing a table with them.  She ignored my body language which indicated it was not okay and plopped her butt down and tried to make conversation.  I wanted to be left alone and she didn't get the hint.  I know there is limited seating but she didn't have to be so rude and oblivious to the fact she wasn't welcome.

I normally don't go to Starbucks because I do feel that it is overpriced, but my wife and I had some time to grab a drink before we had to be somewhere. I got the mocha frappuccino while my wife got the caramel. They were very good, but as other reviews have said, the sitting area is very small.

REVIEW #9:  2 stars  (540 chars)
It's a typical Starbucks as far as workers and drinks go.  The location is very high traffic so it's tough to find parking and seating sometimes. ... The reason I give it two stars is because the majority of the seating is surrounded all by huge windows. I was there for a business meeting a week ago (and it is winter in Wi, so I'm used to the cold), but the windows were so drafty it was freezing by the seats.  I left my winter jacket on the entire time and was still cold. It's great in the summer, but very uncomfortable in the winter.

The staff has been pretty good here for the most part but the seating area is awful and gotten worse.   Recently went there to relax before an appointment.  It was cold outside but I didn't expect it to be cold inside.  I wore my coat the whole time as it was quite chilly and they took out the nice upholstered chairs and put in stools and wooden chairs.   Up front there are just tall barstools.  Not a comfortable coffee shop.   Also the coffee is hit and miss for flavor.   it wouldn't take much for a new coffee shop to move in and take away the business from them.   Any takers?  Please say yes.

REVIEW #11:  1 stars  (1474 chars)
I enjoy and occasional Starbucks Coffee and with the onset of fall, of course the Pumpkin Latte.  Recently I gave this location a couple visits and I'm not impressed.  One visit was around 8:30 a.m. on a weekday and the line was crazy long.  We turned around and left.  Good for them for being busy. ...  ... On a second visit, once again a morning, I powered through the line, waiting more than 15 minutes to order.  When ordering the staff was less than friendly.  I have been testing the new Starbucks Rewards program.  It is a bit confusing.  I have it on my smart phone and I also get offers now that I am enrolled.  I let the person know I had $2 off a sandwich.  She said "do you have a code?"  I said no.  She said "well you have to have a code.  I can't redeem without a code.  Hurry up there's a line."  I said OK I may have deleted the email and I chalked it up to my fault.  I then went to pay with my phone app and the person said "I'm new, I don't know how to use that.  We can't scan that."  Once again rushing me.  Befuttled I paid with cash and waited in line for my coffee to be served.  I do appreciate the staff might be stressed but it does not give a warm fuzzy to me when it's implied that I'm the problem. ...  ... If you are in a rush, this is not the place.  I've been to the Target and Hy-Vee locations which are rarely, busy.  Better yet, local owned places are more friendly. ...  ... Based on multiple experiences I'll remember to go elsewhere.

REVIEW #1:  5 stars  (230 chars)
Have you seen the seating area upstairs?? It is gorgeous, spacious, and full of outlets! It doesn't hurt that you also have a fantastic view of state street from the balcony.  ...  ... I think I've found my home away from home. :)

REVIEW #2:  5 stars  (518 chars)
I know people in Madison like their fair trade and independent coffee houses, but I still love Starbucks. Say what you will, but I love how they make my lattes and cappuccinos. ...  ... I really like the people who work at this Starbucks, especially the really nice older lady. (I don't mean any offense by older, it's just that most people at this location are college students.) But anyway, she is so friendly and always recognizes me - which might say something about my coffee habits....  ...  ... Anyway, 5 stars.

REVIEW #3:  5 stars  (668 chars)
I'm in this location a few times a week, and I always leave happy - definitely not the case for every Starbucks location I visit. The employees make this particular location great. I love that they take time to ask about your day and how they can make your experience better.  ...  ... The setting is just about as great as the staff - go upstairs and sit on the balcony when it's nice outside. It's like being in a little tree house overlooking State Street. This is especially true on the weekend when State is humming with Farmer's Market and other event activity - there's always something interesting (and occasionally bizarre) to see while you drink your coffee.

REVIEW #4:  5 stars  (398 chars)
this is my favorite Starbucks on campus. Needless to say how good Starbucks coffees are, the atmosphere in this Starbucks is very soothing, I like reading, telecommuting or even studying for exam at upstairs, where big couches are provided. I spent most of my class intervals here as it is really strategic to be on the state street. ...  ... I even bought an Ipad from a college student here. LOL.

REVIEW #5:  5 stars  (223 chars)
This is, quite literally, the nicest Starbucks I have ever been in.  Balcony seating overlooking State Street, plus extra seating upstairs, and a fireplace, make this place much more comfortable than your typical Starbucks.

REVIEW #6:  4 stars  (273 chars)
Always friendly workers! Extra seating upstairs, great balcony, and very cozy! The only problems I have found with it are lack of seating, like any other Starbucks, and poor Wi-Fi. Other than that, the service is amazing which is sometimes hard to find at busy coffeeshops.

REVIEW #7:  4 stars  (373 chars)
Best Damn Starbucks in WI ...  ... Starbucks is consistently a 3* coffee house. This rare exception provides a combination of professionalism, efficiency, personality and consistency and is a Capital Square coffee spot that engages in repeat business. It steadily busy, but has never taken longer than 10 minutes to leave with a freshly prepared Venti specialty drink. Yum!

REVIEW #8:  4 stars  (650 chars)
I have spent some significant time in-between classes during the school year in the upstairs. Barista's are the best in town, always kind and will give away the occasional free drink with good conversation. The upstairs is great, lots of seating clean bathroom, great outdoor porch for people watching. The big con is that there is awful Wi-Fi. I thought that you couldn't connect a router to a dial up connection, but I guess this location defied science because the connection couldn't be slower. I hate to be commercial supporting a big business like Starbucks, but it's the only place in Madison to get away from hippies, and I love their coffee.

REVIEW #9:  4 stars  (217 chars)
Okay, how bizarre to review a Starbucks, but the State Street Starbucks employees are seriously amenable to complicated drink requests, as well as consistently efficient and pleasant, and I thoroughly appreciate this.

REVIEW #10:  4 stars  (620 chars)
seriously above excellent for a starbucks. ... Now i have to admit, I used to work for s bucks back in chicago and the guy who hired me is now the DM for starbucks in Wisconsin.  His office is upstairs in this fine establishment. ... He was a seriously fine manager who knows how to treat his employees, and kept high high standards.  So I am not surprised that this location just feels different than any other starbucks I have been to. ... Whevever I am passing through, I try to stop and see if he is in. ... He usually isn't, but perhaps I should call first! ... So, Malcolm, if you are reading this:  LOCK AND LOAD!

REVIEW #11:  4 stars  (908 chars)
So I''ve only been in Madison for a short time, but I love coming to this Starbucks. I am not a huge fan of the coffee here, but the atmosphere is wonderful. The staff have always treated me well, and the first time I came here, one of the ladies working treated me as though we were already good friends. A+ to the nicest barista in the world. ...  ... They have both a downstairs and an upstairs sitting area. Downstairs is more like an normal Starbucks, but the upstairs is split into two areas, including a large outside porch area. The inside upstairs has plenty of space with tables and some more comfortable seats (but watch out because it is pretty cold up there) , and the outside has the same. I''ve only experienced this outdoor porch during June, but it is one of my favorite places to go. Also very close to the Union Terrace and the Lakeshore Path if you'd like to walk after grabbing a coffee.

REVIEW #12:  4 stars  (710 chars)
This location is a very good example for what a Starbucks should be.  Usually, the service is good and timely, even if you go during a rush in the afternoon.  The wifi can be hit or miss depending on how many people are using it. ...  ... The reason for the four star rating is the problem that is common to most State St/Campus open areas - the transient/homeless population.  It's not unusual for one table to be taken up by someone's plastic bags or someone to be sitting out panhandling.  It's not Starbuck's fault - you see that at most coffee shops in the area.  There's really not much they can do to control the problem, short of kicking them out.  That's an issue for the city of Madison to deal with.

REVIEW #13:  2 stars  (528 chars)
Great coffee but the service in the afternoon is poor. I was in there today at 12:45 hoping for some coffee before I headed back to the office and there were only 3 people ahead of me. The girl was so ridiculously slow that I had to give up my spot and leave. If this were the first time that this happened to me at this Starbucks I wouldn't care , but it has happened multiple times.  ...  ... I would suggest that if this particular barista is going to run the check out line they might want to consider a back up to help her.

REVIEW #14:  2 stars  (613 chars)
This Starbucks is always freezing cold in the summer, uncomfortable. But usually, it's comfortable in winter and has a nice lounge upstairs and a second set of bathrooms, which is wonderful. However, today the lounge was freezing cold, causing everyone there to leave on their coats. There is a fireplace that was not lit, so I asked the barista why it wasn't lit, and he said, "it smells like gas, so we have not lit it this year!" It's very cold, and there are lots of nice coffee shops in the area with better coffee and much better food. Really-you can't call a repairman?  ... And the wifi did not work well.

REVIEW #15:  2 stars  (753 chars)
Usually I'm a big fan of Starbucks locations but this one... it is no where near the top of my Starbucks-love list.  ... The staff is friendly, so they mega-props for that. But since it is located in the heart of State Street, it is ALWAYS crowded. I'm usually able to snag a table, but the pickings are slim.  ... My other major complaint is that the wireless rarely works. It is spotty at best. Maybe it is the large number of students using it at the same time, but it never allows me to fully connect and work online.  ... It's also a pretty loud location. Not in an annoying way, but with the music filtering through the speakers and the amount of students working on group projects, it is not easy to work on something that requires concentration.

REVIEW #16:  2 stars  (599 chars)
Well, now I know why coffee snobs (like me) have nicknamed them "Charbucks." Horribly overroasted beans make the coffee taste awful and burnt. ...  ... So, why two stars? Well, for the service! It's awesome...seriously. The employees here are great, even if they have to deal with making coffee from super-crappy, stale beans. ...  ... If I'm in a pinch and have to choose between these guys and the horrendous Espresso Royale across the street? I'm going with Starbucks every time. Nice employees will always make me spend my money over an annoying hipster who can't brew a cup of joe worth a damn.

Agree with all the other folks- really great staff.  Also, a good one too work at: not too loud , just the right amount of background noise.  Starbucks coffee is Starbucks coffee- maybe not the best, but consistent.

REVIEW #2:  5 stars  (518 chars)
Awesome staff every morning, very friendly, and expedient.  This group of baristas never fails to greet, smile, and energize the morning with an engaging conversation.  They will compliment, commend, suggest, and encourage you on the smallest detail of your day or coffee. ...  ... I really love the attention to detail.. Especially the board placed on the counter everyday with the weather, horoscope, super quiz, and joke or cartoon. Just to keep you entertained while you wait on your fabulous caffeinated beverage!

REVIEW #3:  5 stars  (688 chars)
I know I've talked about the staff here, but I just need to repeat how AWESOME they are. The experience is always what I'm looking for! ...  ... Just recently, I asked to see the nutrition label on the flavor syrups, because it's not listed solely on the website. The barista was nice enough to hand it over--AND helped me figure out portion size, because it's listed as 2 Tbsp, not  X "pumps" which all of us SB addicts know is the barista measurement unit.  I usually get two pumps, so she put two pumps in an empty cup to show me how much it was(approx. 2tsp, in case you're curious). Thanks, Lily--you rock! ...  ... Taking the time to do little things like that is top notch service.

REVIEW #4:  5 stars  (363 chars)
I totally agree with Paul C. on this one. This group of employees is the best I've ever had the pleasure of being served by, as far as Starbucks is concerned. ...  ... I live right down the road from this fantastic location by Copp's ...but sometimes I need a mid day pick-me-up and have to go to the one closer to work, which is off Gammon Rd. Just not the same.

REVIEW #5:  5 stars  (450 chars)
Like most Starbucks, this one serves up some hot caffeinated beverages as well as some tasty treats. I happened upon this place after a long walk from my hotel during a wonderful blizzard that dumped about 17" of snow and actually caused them to close early. Hey, I thought Wisconsin was used to snow? ha ha ...  ... The workers were friendly and even comped me some pastries that were going to be tossed or go bad because of the early closure. Cool!

REVIEW #6:  5 stars  (442 chars)
The food and drinks are the same as any other Starbucks. Not my favorite coffee (hello, Peets!), but decent enough. What makes this particular Starbucks outpost exceptional is the wonderfully friendly and helpful employees. It is so refreshing, not to mention unusual, to go to a coffee shop or restaurant, especially a chain location, and find staff who don't seem to hate what they're doing. Great employees = happy and returning customers.

REVIEW #7:  4 stars  (256 chars)
SBUX on our way out of Madison.  Tucked away in a newer shopping square, on the corner by the stoplight where you turn in.  Not bad on-off the highway.  Very friendly folks, parking was available & convienent, and our Venti Mochas were just what we needed.

I haven't been to this location as much as I have some of the other locations but I do enjoy this location. Again they are all kind of the same in a sense but its about the interior and the experience. I actually quite like the people who work at this location. I have seen the same people working here for a while now and they always make me feel so welcome. They are usually a couple of early 30's to middle aged women working here that make ya feel like mom is welcoming you home. "What can I get ya hun," "How's your day going sweety," that kind of stuff. And some people may not like that but I enjoy it because it makes you feel way more comfortable to be somewhere. They are always fast and efficient and any extras you may want are stocked plentifully. The one small thing I don't like is that they are tucked away and really have to be looking for it to know where it is and it is sort of a small building. It can get really cramped if there is a line in there and pushed against some of the valuables. Nice place to stop after some shopping if ya know where it is.

REVIEW #3:  3 stars  (1242 chars)
I am always iffy about chain locations.  Usually you can not mess up a Starbucks too much.  This location was missing something.  The staff was busy having conversations behind the counter so service was slow.  The customers were not being attended to.   ...  ... I had an event near this place so I went two mornings in a row.  Each morning something catastrophic occurred. Day one, while handing a venti coffee to a patron, the barrista was handing the coffee while securing the lid, which resulted in the coffee tipping over and hitting four people.  While cleaning up, I mentioned that coffee was still under the counter and you would have thought that I told the barrista he was completely inadequate.  I would just hate for someone to lean on the counter and get residual hanging coffee.   ...  ... Day two - They ran out of something.  Not sure what.  But something.  I know this because they were all milling around talking crap about someone who was not doing their job.  The funny part is that no one was attending to the people in front of the counter.  Just saying.  The caramel mocha was completely average.  Nothing special.  Definitely glad my event was over but I am sad to see no other competitors in the area but McDonald's.

REVIEW #4:  3 stars  (277 chars)
It did take a while to get our drinks here, but they were super apologetic. It wasn't a big deal as we realized there was someone new that was also training so it took a little longer to get all the drinks ready. Not a big deal. ...  ... Drinks were tasty and I had happy kids.

REVIEW #5:  3 stars  (547 chars)
Let it be known that I strongly dislike Starbucks coffee. I prefer to taste the actual coffee bean flavor, rather than choke down a super-over-roasted, burned-to-within-an-inch-of-its-life-and-left-as-a-shell-of-what-it-once-was coffee bean. ...  ... So... I don't drink the coffee here (or at any Starbucks). That said, I do enjoy the Tzao tea, and the staff is friendly.  ...  ... Lines move quickly. ...  ... It's extremely pricey, considering what you're getting. ...  ... I wish there were some local coffee shops closer to my primary office.

REVIEW #6:  2 stars  (352 chars)
It is so-so.   I went in on  a Sunday morning so it was pretty slow.   The employees were busy talking so they did not great me when I came in and then I asked for them to clean some tables.....I got a sigh and the guy went and cleaned the tables.   Not a single clean table in the place.   You would think if it was that slow the place would be clean!

I only drink their teas and they are fine. The nice aspect of this store is the employees. They make the difference between this coffee shop and other places. Case in point, I was in line when a woman handed the barista a card with her order. The barista read the card, rang her up, took payment, smiled and then gave the hand sign for 'thank you'. Super sweet.

Yes its Starbucks and I prefer Ancora, but.this Monona location has the best service, friendliest staff you will find. It's often busy at 9 am but it's fast as one could expect.

REVIEW #7:  4 stars  (1165 chars)
Yes, I am reviewing a Starbucks.  ... The reason for this review was for the exceptional service I received here this past weekend.  ... My wife has been saving the points up on her Starbucks rewards card (a gold card). It turns out that you have to cash in free drinks within 30 days on your card now, and they can not be stored and used when ever you like. ... So instead of have multiple free drinks on her card for us to use, we only had 1 free one. ... The employee at the counter explained this new rule to us, and still hooked us up with a second free drink any size/ any kind of our choice.  ... It was truly awesome customer service! ... So thank you lady employee behind the register this last Easter Sunday around noon. ...  ... Other things I noticed about this Starbucks, it was very clean, a well organized pastry/muffin area. ... There is no drive thru, so that kinda sucks. ... I counted at least 3 people working behind the counter, so staffed properly. ... Our drinks were made quick and tasted great! ...  ... 4 out of 5 only because it is a Starbucks and there are just so many of them (its not original).  ... Again, excellent customer service!

So this Starbucks is a really nice one as far as comfort goes. It's big, a lot of seats a nice fireplace and the bathrooms have been pretty clean each time I've been there. My problem here is that they don't brew a blonde roast. You have to get a pour over if you want it. Normally that would be fine, but at this location they can not seem to remember they started one. On 3 different occasions I have watched my coffee sit there getting cold. After almost 10 min one time I got an apology... But normally it's about 5 min after it's been done that you get it (after asking). No apology... Just here. It's kinda sad. It would have gotten a 5 star, but they forget you. It would have been 4 star... But no apology.

Yes, I rated a chain 5 stars and here is why... ...  ... My coffee maker, a french press, broke the week before SB opened. My backup, a Keurig, died the next day - no warning just died, wouldn't even turn on.  ... SB has a drive through, I have two kids, dragging them in and out of their car seats is worse then glass in your eye. :)  ... Those are the reasons I went to SB, but here are the reasons why I am giving them five stars.  ...  ... My first two trips through the drive through, because of high volume and new equipment malfunctions (the phone scanner wouldn't scan my phone). They didn't charge me for anything!  ... By the third time through the drive through they knew me and my order. My husband had a similar experience. We found the service exceptional. The staff went out of their way to make sure we had a satisfactory experience. Kudos to you Sun Prairie Starbucks. I am glad you are here. :)

I was so excited when I heard that there would be a Starbucks at this location, as I'd been wondering about this large building on the corner. I thought us crazy kids in Sun Prairie were getting the biggest Starbucks in the WORLD.  ...  ... I was so wrong. Starbucks is just a little bit of this building, the rest is still being finished and I haven't heard anything about what's going in there.  ...  ... At any rate, I wanted to check it out but had already had my caffeine dose for the day so I went with a caramel steamer. The guy at the counter was friendly, the woman over by the coffee machine was super-chatty (but in a fun way and I was in the mood for a little conversation), and my drink was perfect (I don't think steamers are very hard for the average barista but a review is a review).

Service is improving at this location. Staff has always been friendly and courteous. The location of this store is somewhat challenging during busy times.

We were very excited to have Starbucks Coffee near us in Sun Prairie and began visiting regularly. The coffee is great. The staff exceptional, and the layout very comfortable .Unfortunately  it ends there. We found that the temperature is always set at freezing, winter and summer. The music is so loud you can't here yourself think, or hold a conversation, and the genre is pop. we tried sitting outside weather permitting only to find tables and chairs not yet cleaned from the winter. ... We will continue to visit Starbucks because of the friendly staff and great coffee, but will sit outside, after cleaning the chairs and tables

REVIEW #7:  2 stars  (438 chars)
SLOW service. After twice suffering through  the drive-thru - SLOW - I thought it might be faster to park and go in.  Nope. staff seem to be fluttering around without actually producing anything.  Plus much chatting among themselves and ignoring customers. i thought it was startup adjustment but now I think they just cant get it together (or don't really care) . too bad b/c it is a great location to stop between shopping destinations.

REVIEW #8:  1 stars  (665 chars)
I come here way too often for you to be fucking up my coffee the way they do. EASY ICE, it's not that complicated. I finally said something to the girl at the window, after having to scoop out ice, on more than one occasion. She looked at me, dumbfounded, and continued to stare at me without any apology, "we'll try not to fuck it up next time" nothing. Maybe she should work a little harder on her customer service and less on her tacky red lipstick . I'll stick to the east side, for some reason sun prairie cannot handle the drive through AT ALL. get it together, it's coffee, not rocket science, and I'm not ordering some fluffy drink with twelve steps either.

REVIEW #9:  1 stars  (791 chars)
We have been to Starbucks' all over the world and have never received such poor and SLOW service. EVER. We were excited to see one put in near our home and close to places we shop frequently. Naturally we have visited about 5 times, giving it the benefit of the doubt, "they are new, they are training new staff, etc". Last night we were in there, the only people in there and no greeting by any of the 4 employees. we waited at the counter for 3 or 4 minutes before someone said they would be right with us. took our order.  waited 10 minutes for them to make our drinks and they still came out wrong. i wasn't going to bother to have them fix it because we didn't have the time to wait another 20 minutes! ...  ... Starbucks needs to take note that this location is giving them a bad name.
