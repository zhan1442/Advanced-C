I was on vacation and found this cleaners in the area. They were super friendly and the place is clean. The prices are a bit higher then other places, but they found some casino chips in my pants pocket and returned them to me when I picked up my clothes! VERY IMPRESSED!

their prices may be higher than some asian cleaners but their quality of service is excellent. it really shows they take care of their customers clothing. i have never had my shirts packed so nicely when i pick them up at other cleaners. and looking over their work i found no flaws. ...  ... you get what you pay for here. and i will continue to be their customer :)

Holy cow.  It cost me like $25 to get a couple of sweaters dry cleaned here last year.   Granted, they did a good job, and they packed them in some really nice covers, but ouch.  Check pricing before you drop off your stuff here.

I had a very bad experience with the store.  Very rude seamstress. She cost the company she works for money because my husband and I will never go there again.  If you are looking for a friendly family business, do not go to Boston cleaners on West Charleston they are expensive, rude and unfriendly.
