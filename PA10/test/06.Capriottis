All I'm gonna say is Capastrami Sandwich. Love it and miss it. Can someone send one over to Fort Wayne, IN? I'm preggers and need a fix. :)

REVIEW #2:  5 stars  (1142 chars)
Amazing cheesesteak. ...  ... One mile from my home is Corleone's. About 15-20 minutes from my home is Capriotti's. I never go to Corleone's. I go to Capriotti's all the time. ...  ... The workers here are nice and the cheesesteak is terrific. The large is 20" I believe, so if you're ordering for yourself and in no mood to eat until you have a stroke, get the medium. Also, try it with the hot peppers. It adds the slightest bit of spice without becoming too overwhelming. ...  ... That's really all I can say about this place. Wonderful cheesesteak. I haven't tried anything else because the cheesesteak is too good to pass up when I make the drive down there. The patrons rave about the other sandwiches, though, so I absolutely would not be afraid to try something else. There's maybe 5 or 6 tables inside and 2 outside? so be prepared to order to go if you arrive at prime dine-in lunch/dinner hours. ...  ... Do yourself a favor and go to Capriotti's. Help this place attain the reviews and ratings it deserves. The fact that there's only 8 reviews is criminal. I understand it is in the heart of the suburbs, but it's worth the drive.

REVIEW #3:  5 stars  (221 chars)
Awesome sandwiches.  I've been here a few times now and every time, the sandwiches are fresh and filling.  This is probably my favorite sandwich shop in town. The service is great and all of the staff are always friendly.

REVIEW #4:  5 stars  (363 chars)
Awesome steak sandwiches.  The meat is very tender and very flavorful, you won't be let down I just wished I ordered more my first time there. There is always next time though.  So far everything I have had here is excellent and I just say you should go try it out.  Next time I am going to try the italian sub there, should be good.  I need to go back here soon.

REVIEW #5:  5 stars  (711 chars)
Everytime we're even near the I-10 and Chandler Blvd, we stop here and get sandwiches.  Why?  VEGGIE MEATS!!!!  They have veggie turkey, veggie hamburger and even veggie chicken.  There's nowhere else (that I know of in Phx) that you can get a deli sub made with veggie meats...especially this kind of quality.  We always order the largest size:  a whopping 20 inches, which we can usually get 2-3 meals out of. ...  ... And of course their signature subs:  the "Bobbie" (w/cranberry sauce, stuffing, and turkey) and the "Cole Turkey" (w/cheese, turkey, and cole slaw) make this the ultimate veggie sandwich shop.  YUMMY! ...  ... p.s. call ahead and order...you'll be glad you did when the line's out the door!

Great food  great service

REVIEW #8:  5 stars  (136 chars)
Great sandwich! Better yet the staff our truly excellent. I left my purse there and they called me to let me know! Thanks again so much!

REVIEW #9:  5 stars  (968 chars)
How has one of the best sandwich joints in AZ only been reviewed 3 times!? Come on AZ Yelpers, get up on your grind, yo.  ... I crave these sandwiches, i miss them, i pine over them, they haunt me at every turn. They are that good. ...  ... First visit - Cheese Steak - Oh my god, never been to philly but i hope they are this good there. The bun, the meat, the cheese, the veg; all perfect.  ...  ... Second Visit - The bobby - what... wait, a sandwich with Turkey, Cranberry Sauce, Stuffing, and Mayo!? That is practically a thanksgiving leftover sandwich all year around, does it get better than that!? ...  ... Third Visit - Eggplant Parmesan - Holy crap it is the size of my head and oozing everywhere. Mhhh bready eggplant, cheese and sauce, the trifecta of tastebud tantalization.  ...  ... This place is a must for all AZ sandwich aficionados, be warned tho they are HUGE so bring a friend... if you don't have friends try showering because you probably smell.

REVIEW #10:  5 stars  (256 chars)
I have eaten here too many times to count and all I can say is amazing food and great service. Thanks to the senior vp Jason in Vegas telling me about this place on twitter or else I would never have found it.  I love the Capastrami, the Bobby and Italian.

REVIEW #11:  5 stars  (491 chars)
I haven't been here through their "rush" hours, so service has always been fast and friendly.   ...  ... Capastrami - Hot pastrami, Cole slaw, swiss cheese, and Russian dressing WITH sweet peppers. I can't get past ordering anything else when I come here.  Quality through and through. ...  ... One of these days I'll try their famous "Bobbie" (tryptophan coma here I come)... or maybe I'll just have to go Gal vs. Food and order the Capastrami AND the Bobbie (tryptophan coma and the -itis)

REVIEW #12:  5 stars  (488 chars)
I love the sandwiches here, they serve fresh bread and meat that can't be beat!! Both Chicken and Beef cheese steak are superb and the Bobbie is in a league of it's own. I don't know how I lived on the other Sub chains before finding Capriotti's call in your order and give them about 15 mins and you will be eating shortly upon arrival.  The largest sandwich cost about 12.50 but at 20 inches two people can dine nicely, all I can say is bring your appetite and you won't be disappointed

REVIEW #13:  5 stars  (317 chars)
I love this place.  The sandwiches are unique and fresh and always made right in front of you.  The service has always been good and the prices are reasonable (same as any other sandwich shop).  I have tried many of their sandwiches and enjoyed them, my favorite is the cheesesteak, but beware- the peppers are spicy!

REVIEW #14:  5 stars  (904 chars)
I must say that I have been here four times in four weeks.  The sandwiches are great.  The bread is fresh and tasty clearly made within hours of serving.  The order is taken right when you walk in, so there is no unnecessary waiting.  Most of the time the line is short and I get served within minutes.  The sandwiches use a reasonable portion of meats and other ingredients which balance the sandwich, not bury it in the bread.  The guys behind the counter know there sandwiches and can answer any if not all questions that you may have.    ...  ... I normally get a medium sandwich, the large is just too large (e.g. two meals!).  They also serve Wise brand potato chips from the East Coast which are hard to come by in Phoenix, but not impossible. ... A great place to have a quick lunch that will not have you waiting and keep you satisfied throughout the day. ... My recommendations.................

REVIEW #15:  5 stars  (916 chars)
I wanted to review this location since I'd just given a less than stellar review of a different location... ...  ... The Ahwatukee store ROCKS!  I guess since I've always had really good food and service from this store, I'd come to expect the others to be just as good.  Unfortunately, that is not the case. ...  ... My usual is the chicken cheese steak w/grilled mushrooms and onions, sweet peppers on the sandwich and hot peppers on the side.  Not many places around that you can order a chicken cheese steak where the chicken is actually sliced thin like a regular cheesesteak as opposed to big hunks of dried out chicken on a sandwich.  I've never had a bad one at this location. Never.   ...  ... Like I said they are consistently good - that's why it was such a disappointment when twice at other locations the food was not as good as these guys make it here.  I don't think I'll try another location again...

REVIEW #16:  5 stars  (1399 chars)
I went to college at the University of Delaware, Delaware being the home of Capriotti's of course, and had enjoyed it a time or two there. So when my boyfriend told me that him and some friends had gone to a sandwich place called Capriotti's out here for lunch I said to myself, "Could it be?". It is!! It is!!! The very same one!! Bobbies and all!!! Oh happy day!!!! Randomly they have a couple of west coast locations, one of which happens to be 2 miles from my house, and for having the foresight to put that there, I thank them! In college, my roommate and I always vowed that one day, we would pool our money and split a Bobby. Tragically, it was always out of our 52 cent Ramen Noodle price range, so that dream never came true, until now. Although my lovely roomie of 3 1/2 years is not here to share it with me, I got to have that Bobby, and OH was it worth waiting for. Fresh, delicious rolls, real roasted turkey, not that sliced stuff my friends, just like mama makes, and stuffing and cranberry to top it all off. I'm a happy girl! If I didn't have Thanksgiving plans, I'd probably just get myself a Bobby and call it a day. The people are always friendly and the sandwiches are a little more than $5 for a foot-long, but OHHH SOOO worth it!! After reading all these reviews about the cheese steak, I'm excited to try that now, but it will take a lot of willpower to NOT order the Bobby.

REVIEW #17:  5 stars  (1198 chars)
In the very great and wise words of my father "Holy Crap That's Good!". There is no wiser sentence that can describe how amazing this place is! One of my dear friends took me to this place that he knew about. It apparently is the "IT" place to go in Vegas. I had my doubts.  ... We drove up to the place and it looked a little dumpy (apparently this is a sign of a great place to eat). There wasn't much on the wall except for a menu with about 30 different subs. I allowed my friend to order for me since it seemed like he knew what the best thing to get was. He ordered a turkey sub on wheat with slaw and extra Russian.  ... The kids behind the counter couldn't have been much older then 17 and reminded me of every single person in my graduating class. Helpful and pleasant enough to not get fired. When they were done making my sandwich I swear it was the biggest "medium" sub I had ever seen.  ... When I took my first bite it was to die for! It was not a sandwich for the dainty. The sandwich got all over the place and was the best sandwich I had ever eaten! I had never eaten a sandwich with Cole slaw on it, but it is something to be tried.  ... I declare that everyone needs to eat here!

REVIEW #18:  5 stars  (901 chars)
Lately I've been going to eat to places that have 4-5 stars and everyone raves about them!! And just like when someone tells me that a movie is the best ever!!!!  my expectations are very high, I watch it and more often that not, I'm disappointed.  ...  ... I'm glad to say that Capriotti's didn't disappointed me at all! I had a Capistrami and it was delicious! Also, it was the smaller size (9inches) and it was huge! Big enough to share, but being that I was very hungry and I don't like to save a sandwich with coleslaw for later....well, I ate it all!   ... I agree though with other reviews that mentioned the bread could be better. Luckily the great filling made up for the not as great bread. ...  ... Service was good and the guys behind the counter were very nice as well. ...  ... The price is fair since the sandwiches are huge.  ...  ... I'll definitely come back to try other sandwiches.

REVIEW #19:  5 stars  (74 chars)
Love their Bobby sandwich! Have to stop here everytime we visit. So yummy!

REVIEW #20:  5 stars  (373 chars)
Mushroom Cheesesteak with provolone & mayo, a bag of Wise chips, and a Coke. ...  ... Doesn't that sound appetizing?  I pretty much get the same thing every single time I come here. ...  ... They make my cheesesteak EXACTLY they way I prefer my cheesesteak sandwich.   ...  ... Call in your order before driving there if you are impatient.  Either way, it's worth the wait.

REVIEW #21:  5 stars  (926 chars)
OMG. ...  ... A friend of mine had been raving about this place for months, and he finally talked me into going there a week ago.  ...  ... It was late at night, and there were 2 very attentive people on staff.  ...  ... I ordered the "Slaw Be Joe", which is shredded roast beef, russian dressing, provolone cheese, and mountains of cole slaw.  I'm not a big cole slaw fan, so I had my reservations, but it was awesome.  ...  ... I ordered a medium sized sandwich (I forget how many inches it is), and it was HUGE.  The slaw was cold, sweet, crisp and fresh. The meat was tender and juicy, and the bread fresh and toasty.   ...  ... My friend got "The Bobby" which is basically a thanksgiving dinner in sandwich form. Turkey, stuffing, gravy, cranberry sauce, and possible gravy and cheese. I'm not sure, since I only had a bite, but the bite I had was delicious.  ...  ... Portions huge, food tastes great, prices very right.

REVIEW #22:  5 stars  (243 chars)
Outstanding sandwiches!  The Capistrami and Slaw-B-Joe's ROCK!  Moreover, nobody can come close to the bread that they use.  Capriotti's would deliver sandwiches to our Little League snack stand, and they were always snapped up within minutes.

REVIEW #23:  5 stars  (106 chars)
Possibly the best sandwich shop in town. the cole turkey, well words can't describe a sandwich this tasty.

REVIEW #24:  5 stars  (490 chars)
Probably the best sandwich shop in the area.  My favorite is the "SlawBeJo", with homemande roast beef, provolone cheese, cole slaw, russian dressing and mayo....and I don't even like cole slaw!...but it's so good with the roast beef!  Their sandwiches are unique in that none of the meats are your typical sliced meat..they are more like a "pulled" meat...so good!   ...  ... Clean place, friendly staff. ...  ... Expect a small wait, even if the place is empty...but it is soooo worth it!

REVIEW #25:  5 stars  (937 chars)
So much better than Subway or the other pretenders. ...  ... A 9-inch sandwich for $6.75 is awesome and more than enough food, and not just a bread filler.  Locally owned, I met the guy today at lunch and actually told him about Yelp so he'll be checking his reviews out, but he was really nice as were the guys taking orders and making the food.  This place gets busy at lunch as the business people around know where to eat when it's good.  I've heard a few of my cop buddies say how good it is too and they weed out all the bad places pretty quick. ...  ... Anyways, the sandwiches are really good and all the meat, cheeses and all the fixin's are really fresh and always plentiful on your sandwich. ...  ... And look for the "Bobby"... It's like your whole Thanksgiving dinner exploding in your mouth... turkey, stuffing and cranberry sauce... I'm serious it's so good. ...  ... Enjoy guys... it's really good food for a great price.

REVIEW #26:  5 stars  (135 chars)
The Capastrami was awesome! One of the best subs that I have had in a long time. Very nice staff and clean restaurant. Very fulfilling.

REVIEW #27:  5 stars  (128 chars)
The chicken cheese steak w/ mushrooms and hot peppers occasionally appears in my dreams. ...  ... Always great food and service.

REVIEW #28:  5 stars  (342 chars)
These are awesome sandwiches! I'm not talking about the veggie crap. I'm talking cheese steak, Capistrami and Turkey pure love. I like to get the cheese steak with hot and mild peppers. It just melts in your mouth. I can't help but laugh at the negative reviews by the Vegans on here. This place is great, if you want Vegan go get some Humus.

REVIEW #29:  5 stars  (305 chars)
This is my FAVORITE sandwich place! The sandwiches are incredible. The use shredded beef and turkey that gives the sandwich so much more flavor. The people working there are always plesant and helpful. I have tried several and have never been disappointed. They are large sandwiches and great for sharing.

REVIEW #30:  5 stars  (751 chars)
Went back to Phoenix to visit family and was intent on getting a pastrami sandwich from one of the other deli's but never found the time to go. On the way back home my daughter suggested Capriotti's and I figured it was worth trying it out. When I got there I was dead set on the pastrami, called the "Capastrami", but notice a picture of the "The Bobbie" which is real pulled turkey, stuffing, cranberry, and mayo. I couldn't make up my mind so i ordered both. They were nice enough to give me half of each to eat there, and wrapped the other halves up to take with me, making the 5 hour drive back to SD so much more tolerable. They were both awesome, but I now crave the Bobbie and am making my daughter bring me one out when she comes to visit. :)

REVIEW #31:  5 stars  (882 chars)
When you decide to become a vegetarian, you realize that there are some sacrifices you are going to have to make in the food department. When I became veg, veggie burgers were made by mixing this powder with water and frying it in a pan. It was horrible. I pretty much ate grilled cheese for the first year.  ...  ... Now, fifteen years later, Capriotti's...  Holy Shit!!! VEGGIE TURKEY SUB. Tears of joy are streaming down my face at THIS very moment. It's like losing your virginity all over again, but this time its good! Real good! ...  ... For $7.75 I have the hugest, most delicious sub I have ever eaten in my life. Such good quality ingredients, and this medium is HUGE! ...  ... They also have New York Kettle Style Chips, which are delish, but you definitely don't need them when you have 12" of veggie turkey sub staring you down. ...  ... My life seriously just changed.

REVIEW #32:  5 stars  (81 chars)
Woohoo, this place is really good. a little spendy but you will not leave hungry.

REVIEW #33:  5 stars  (303 chars)
YUMMO!  Thanks to my hubby for introducing me to this sandwich shop!  This not your ordinary sub shop!  They make their turkey and roast beef and shred it fresh!  So awesome compared to sliced meat (less sodium and preservatives this way).  I love the homemade turkey sub and my husband loves the bobby!

REVIEW #34:  4 stars  (505 chars)
#1 reason why I love this place.... *drumroll* They have the most delicioius vegetarian sandwiches! And I don't mean just bread and a bunch of veggies, but they have a delicious meatless "turkey" which tastes like the real thing, but it's been so long I don't remember what the real thing tastes like anymore. Anyway, very very good hearty sandwiches. Definitely try this place out if you're in a mood for a good sandwich, oh and I guess the real meat ones are supposed to be good too, ha. Try this place!

REVIEW #36:  4 stars  (693 chars)
Big sandwiches.  Big. ...  ... Bread is great on a good day and fair when they don't have it fresh. ...  ... Mom loves the Philly cheese-steak. ...  ... I like the Italian.  I always ask for hot peppers. ...  ... Ordering and paying can be a bit confusing.  Best thing to do is to order and immediately go to the cash register to pay.  Otherwise you have your sandwich, you're hungry and then you have to go pay.  I'm not sure how they don"t get ripped off.  It would seem to me it would be easy to order, wait, take and leave.  ...  ... The chips they offer, name escaping me now, are very good.  I know that at most sandwich places I do not get chips but here I do.  BBQ is my favorite here.

REVIEW #37:  4 stars  (94 chars)
Capriotti's has some great sandwiches... the best is the capistromi; the medium is really big.

REVIEW #38:  4 stars  (556 chars)
First time here and it was really good. I ordered the bobbie sandwich since I hear everyone raving about it. It was ok. Not my favorite. Place is really clean and wasn't busy at all for lunch around 1130. I like going to a place where I can get in and get out. Staff was really friendly. They gave me this punch card.. buy 10 get the 11th free. Very nice. About the same prices as subway so I wasn't upset. Plus the sizes of food are definitely moneys worth. At least I think. For anyone in the Chandler area, this is definitely a place to stop in and try.

REVIEW #39:  4 stars  (293 chars)
Found this place by accident, and sure glad I did. ...  ... Most sandwich joints are the same old deli meat subs, but this place is a bit different. ...  ... I ordered a turkey sub and I was delighted to see the turkey was whole pieces, pulled from the breast. What a great, fresh tasting sub.

REVIEW #40:  4 stars  (146 chars)
Great sandwich very well built and it had all that you would want in it. Filled me up and I was very happy with it.   ...  I will be back for more

REVIEW #41:  4 stars  (776 chars)
Holy Sweet Peppers! The most amazing sandwich my little vegan belly has ever had!!  ...  ... I have NEVER heard of a sandwich shop that has veggie/vegan turkey, its 100% soy and 1000% delicious! The rolls they use are baked fresh daily at a local Tempe bakery and are out of this world! A small sub is literally the size of my forearm!! I like mine with mustard, lettuce, tomato, salt and pepper, oil and vinegar, pickles and of course SWEET PEPPERS!!  ...  ... I can't get enough of this place, I've been 3x in the last week!  ...  ... The only thing keeping this from being a 5 star review is that even if I order my sandwich to go and spend less than 5 minutes inside the shop I leave smelling like the cheese steak grill. ...  ... Maybe they could do curbside service? ;-)

REVIEW #42:  4 stars  (321 chars)
I always get the vegetarian cheese steak (even though meat lovers would say there's no such thing as vegetarian cheese steak). Hot and totally delicious! The wait might be long during lunch, but I usually call ahead and get a take out. They also have a punch card that gets you the 10th sandwich free. Awesome sandwiches!

REVIEW #43:  4 stars  (815 chars)
I can assure you that I was pretty much the biggest pain in the ass customer in the history of this place.  Mainly because they put coleslaw on their sandwiches, and I really detest coleslaw.  But when I found out just how prohibitive that was, I relented and ordered the capastrami (i think) which was pastrami, swiss, russian dressing, and coleslaw. ...  ... And much to my surprise, it was actually really damn good.  Please note: this is the first time in about 25 years that I've voluntarily eaten coleslaw.  But it worked with the sandwich, and worked well. ...  ... They have a sandwich on the menu, the bobbie, that is turkey, cranberry sauce, stuffing, and one other thing and they claim that that is a really great sandwich.  Perhaps next time... although I might have a hard time forgoing the capastrami.

REVIEW #44:  4 stars  (839 chars)
I found this place by accident, and I have to say, its a good sub shop.  When you walk in, its not a giant place.  Indoor seating only, and they have a super duper high wall between you and the guys making your sandwich.  For short people like me, its a little intimidating. ...  ... Like the size of this place, the menu is not huge.  They have quite a few subs to choose from, hot and cold, each coming in a variety of sizes.  9 inch, 12 inch, and I think a larger one too.  They have the traditional "good stuff" to choose from like roast beef, meatball and tuna subs.  Prices seem worthwhile, and I got a 9 inch roast beef sub and took home leftovers. ...  ... Great for a sub anytime, day or night.  reasonable hours and prices, and the staff seemed friendly.  Worth grabbing something to eat on a saturday afternoon, just like I did.

REVIEW #45:  4 stars  (259 chars)
I had no idea this was so close to where I live. The sandwiches here never disappoint, the staff is always friendly and the price is unbeatable for what you get. My only reasoning for 4 instead of 5 stars is that I wish it were a smidge cleaner on the inside.

REVIEW #46:  4 stars  (1003 chars)
I heard about Capriotti's from my partner who discovered them while in Las Vegas for work; decided to try them out several months ago. The sandwiches are very good, and when I ate meat, I enjoyed the Bobbie. ...  ... However, since becoming vegetarian almost one year ago, I hadn't had the opportunity to dine here again. That was until I discovered they have vegetarian options! I returned a few days ago for lunch and sampled the veg turkey sub as well as the veg cheesesteak sub. Both were pretty good; I really enjoyed my lunch. The cheesesteak was ordered with mushrooms and was full of cheesy-oniony-peppery goodness but I think I preferred the veg turkey sandwich for its simplicity. Worth a shot if you happen to be in this part of Chandler. (Note- they do cook the veg cheesesteak on the same grill that they cook their real meat on, be forewarned if this bothers you.. although it clearly states this on the menu. Request if they can cook it on a freshly cleaned, different part of the grill.)

REVIEW #47:  4 stars  (803 chars)
I was looking for a new sub shop... So I had heard good things about this spot I entered the shop at about 7:15 and they say they are open till 8:00 all the chairs were up and it looked closed... But I pulled the door open and entered and stood at the counter and someone come from the back. I knew what I wanted I ordered... (The Bobbie - Homemade turkey, Cranberry sauce, stuffing and Mayo. I rate the food as followed. ...  ... The Bobbie - B+ ...  ... It was a really good sub the bread was super fresh but the turkey was a bit dry like it would be after thanksgiving... Each bit reminded me of things I have made with leftovers from thanksgiving. I will be back again to get another Bobbie when I miss home at 2am after the bars when I am home for thanksgiving and have only leftovers to work with.

REVIEW #48:  4 stars  (1720 chars)
I was that annoying customer asking a bunch of questions and unable to make up my mind.  The guy was patient and answered all of my questions with a smile.  I had to wait several minutes for the two sandwiches, but, hey, quality take time, right?  ...  ... The manager (I think) came out of the back, happy, jolly, and singing to the radio.  It was great; good energy.  People engaged in their work and have fun doing it are more engaging and enjoyable to be around.   ...  ... When my sandwiches were almost done, Mr. Happy Manager rang up my order and gave me my total.  It seemed a little high.  When I questioned the amount, I found out they were making three sandwiches instead of two.  Yep, that was my fault for making the order-taking process so confusing.  I apologized and tipped a few bucks on my take-out order.  They didn't seem annoyed or flustered at all.   Cool points for good customer service.  Plenty of other places would have made a big deal. ...  ... As far as the sandwiches go, fantastic!  Soft, delicious bread.  Sweet and hot peppers that make the sandwich.  The most vegetarian options I have ever seen for a cheese steak sandwich shop, and quite impressively tasty at that!  Veg heads and meat lovers alike will both crave the goodness of a Capriotti's sandwich!  No longer does one person have to "sacrifice" for the other's meal. ...  ... The small sub is more than enough for one person.  If you are looking to split a sandwich, or have leftovers, go ahead and get a large.  Then again, I guess if you normally eat extremely enormous portions, a medium or large would probably work. ...  ... Trust me, just go here when you are in the mood for a good, hearty sandwich.

I went here the day i found out i had vertigo. true story. it's now part of my history.  ...  ... i woke up and instantly thought 'did i get drunk last night and i dont remember?' ...  ... not the case, i had to have my mom pick me up and if i remember correctly i had to scoot down the 3 flights of apartment stairs so that i wouldn't fall. if only someone recorded that and put it on youtube... ...  ... anywho, after the dr. said it was vertigo causing my issues, i got to go home but i was hungry and wanted a sandwich. all of the nurses said to go here. so my mom drove me and bought me lunch. :)  ...  ... the turkey is some of the best i have had!! they seriously packed the sandwich so thick with layers of divine turkey. they had a sandwich related to thanksgiving and i need to try it, and lots of goodies from the east coast that we don't typically see in az. i will totes be back.

REVIEW #50:  4 stars  (533 chars)
I'm not gonna tell you anything that the other reviews haven't already mentioned. True, the "Bobbie" is the marque menu item here, and it's really as good as advertised (if you like a good thanksgiving sandwich.) Other than that, I have not been blown away by the food here, above average sandwiches and the like, just not amazing. ...  ... Service has been great here though. Several occasions they have run out of something, and comped or discounted parts of our order. These guys have a mom and pop feel despite being a franchise.

REVIEW #51:  4 stars  (785 chars)
It's pretty exciting when you go into a sub shop and they offer vegetarian cheese "steak" sandwich.   I've never had a cheese steak sandwich, so as I was driving back to the office, with my sandwich in tow, I kept peeking in the bag thinking, "Is this real?" Yes It was, and it was fantastic!  I was expecting a greasy cheesy mess, but that wasn't the case at all. The "meat" and peppers were perfectly cooked to order and topped with real cheese, not cheese whiz. I had them add mushrooms, which was a solid choice, well worth the extra buck.  The bread was very soft inside with a little crunch to crust, similar to Italian bread.  Needless to say, I enjoyed every bite of my $10 sandwich.  The best part may have been seeing my co-workers jaws drop at the sight of me eating "meat".

Just had a hot sausage sandwich with peppers, provolone and marinara and it was delicious. Great take-out place with wide range of cold and hot sandwiches. I prefer ordering from the hot list.

REVIEW #53:  4 stars  (266 chars)
Loved it!!!! Great sandwiches, good service, We really like this place even though it's a bit out of the way and small. The food is good. My wife and I eat here at least once a week and have yet to be disappointed. I love the Cheese Steak with mushrooms and onion!!!

REVIEW #54:  4 stars  (303 chars)
Man they make a good sandwich here. The Thanksgiving themed one is great as well as the pastrami. The bread is very tasty with the right amount of chew. ...  ... Its a small place, the kitchen /grill takes up most of it. I will say a lil pricey but its def higher quality the the super chains out there.

REVIEW #55:  4 stars  (628 chars)
My BF and I are always in a hunt for a good cheesesteak. So far, this is the best one I've had in AZ.  ...  ... Mushroom Cheesesteak with sweet peppers and onions! I like how everything is cooked up and mixed together with the cheese as the binding unit. I can't get myself to try their other sandwiches since I don't make it out this way too often and when I do I want that cheesesteak! The bread is soft with little cornmeal bits. It all goes together perfectly. ...  ... The small is huge and good for two meals. The large is enough to feed the entire office. lol. Okay, I overexaggerated a little... but seriously it's huge!

REVIEW #56:  4 stars  (507 chars)
My girlfriend has been craving a mushroom steak and cheese sub for the past couple of weeks, and while that's easy to find in New England where we're both from, it's not so easy to find in the Phoenix area. ...  ... But, now we know where to look. ...  ... Great sandwiches and a great looking menu that we'll be exploring for quite a while. And they also stock a variety of Wise potato chips products which aren't widely available here. ...  ... For a taste of home, we know where to go, and we'll be back.

REVIEW #57:  4 stars  (298 chars)
Oh my gosh... biggest "small" sandwich ever! I ordered a small sub sandwich, which turns out is 9 inches! A small!! I was more than full when I finished... and I couldn't even put down the whole sandwich. The staff was super friendly and made our sandwiches to order. Yup, I'll be going again soon.

REVIEW #58:  4 stars  (197 chars)
Seriously, best sandwich I've had in a while. Definitely start with the Bobbie. Then work your way over to the other delicious things you can put in between pieces of bread. Oh, they do salads too.

REVIEW #59:  4 stars  (235 chars)
Stopped in on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed. Great, bad for you sandwiches that will push back whatever diet you think your on at least a day. Not a regular stop, but an infrequent indulgence I will look forward to.

REVIEW #60:  4 stars  (333 chars)
The Capastrami was amazing.  I'm not a sub or sandwich person but I believe its the sub bread that made this so great.  It was fresh as if it just came out of the oven and light - not dense.  Flavors were terrific and the pastrami was wonderful.  This place is practically around the corner from my house and I'll come back for more.

REVIEW #61:  4 stars  (552 chars)
The Capistrami is the best thing ever.  Hot pastrami, swiss cheese, cole slaw and a russian dressing.  I'm addicted to this sandwich, but of course, there are worse vices.  This sandwich screams 'eat me' even when I'm completely full.  It's okay, the pain I feel later is justified by how amazing it tasted earlier.  They have a good selection of chips and also make fresh baked cookies.  Service is on par.  Love it.  If I had to pick one gripe, the bread could probably be a little bit better, but that's minor in light of how great the food is here.

REVIEW #62:  4 stars  (874 chars)
The sandwich is such a good deal if you get the 20" sub. I got the turkey sandwich the first time and added vinegar and oil as dressing. The turkey was very dry and needed a pastier or more liquid dressing to season but the vegetables on the sandwich were fresh and complemented the vinegar and oil well. The second time I got the Italian sausage with mushrooms. This took a while to come out but the taste was worth the wait. The sauce was a fresh tomato paste that was warm and tangy on the greasy and delicious sausage. The mushrooms were a great add since it creates a certain texture and flavor that  swirls in the mouth well. The bread both times was soft and great tasting as it is white bread. The decor and place itself are a bit drab but I think they expect people to take it out more often than not. This sandwich place is very delicious and I would recommend it.

REVIEW #63:  4 stars  (620 chars)
The thing i love most about this place is that it's unique. It's not the same list of deli sandwiches you'd find at most other sub shops, and like others have said, the meat is shredded and not sliced.  ...  ... The portions are huge, so the price really is worth it. If you're looking for your $5 footlong, please do yourself a favor and run over to subway.  ...  ... Staff is friendly, quick (even when busy), and they know how to make a great sandwich!  The menu is slightly limited, but what they do offer is great. If i'm ever in a mood for a hearty sandwich, this is the place i go. My fav is the Turkey Cole. Yum!

REVIEW #64:  4 stars  (312 chars)
They didn't ask if I wanted the sweet peppers and onions on the cheesesteak. I totally forgot about it and remembered the second I opened up the butcher paper. The cheesesteak just wasn't the same. The Bobbie, was amazing though.  ...  ... 50 miles round trip to get here from North Scottsdale - it was worth it.

REVIEW #65:  4 stars  (1063 chars)
This lovely place I discovered in Las Vegas when I lived there.  (The one in vegas is on Alta between Rainbow and Buffalo near sushi on summerlin, but I've heard it's moved since then.) ...  ... I would have given this 5 stars, but I have found that their roast beef sandwich leaves a little to be desired -- mostly because it's like shredded roast beef, so it's a bit bland and extremely dry. ...  ... That aside, everything else just flies into the hearty flavorful sandwich realm. ...  ... I would recommend the Mushroom Cheese Steak, Grilled Italian or Meatball sandwich. ...  ... Their specials Capastrami (hot pastrami, cole slaw, swiss cheese and russian dressing) and The "Bobbie" (turkey, cranberry sauce, stuffing and mayo) are something to get all hot and bothered over. ...  ... Capriotti's also has Vegetarian Sandwiches -- soy Turkey, Balogna, Salami and burgers -- if you are not a meat eating kind of person. ...  ... Overall, I love Capriotti's, but am happy they are quite a ways away.  I'd eat there at least 3 times a week if they were closer.

REVIEW #66:  4 stars  (346 chars)
This one is easy.  They have the BEST RUBEN ON THE PLANET.   It's their own take on the Ruben, but sooo Yummy.  Just order it!!!   ...  ... The Turkey with Cranberry, a must try.   ...  ... I would tell you more, except these are the only two sandwiches I have had. ...  ... They would have received a five star rating if seating had been better.

REVIEW #67:  4 stars  (578 chars)
This used to be a franchise shop...and it was great.  I would have given it 5 stars.  Since the owner sold the franchise back to corporate it is still really good...service is just not as great.  The food is still top notch.  The Capastomi sandwich is sooooo good.  Grilled pastrami on top of cole slaw...yes cole slaw with Russian dressing.  I'm not a big fan of cole slaw, but it absolutely makes this sandwich.  My family call the Capastromi sandwich "Unicorn Meat"...it's so good it's mythical.  Be sure to try out the "Dragon Meat" sandwiches at Phoenix Cheesesteak Co.  :)

REVIEW #68:  4 stars  (447 chars)
This was my first time here on a whim. I ordered the veggie turkey even though I'm in no way following a vegetarian regimen. I asked for wheat roll and unfortunately they only have wheat available for regular sandwiches, not subs. Even though, I was not disappointed by the flavorful roll of the sub! The veggie turkey was just as if I was having real true turkey and would not hesitate to return and try more of the menu if our paths cross again.

REVIEW #69:  4 stars  (699 chars)
You will not be disappointed! Huge sandwiches for very reasonable prices. I feel like the Bobbie was created for me- turkey, stuffing, cranberries, and mayo. It's definitely a nap waiting to happen, but so delicious! The mayo adds that extra little touch. ...  ... Cheesesteaks are also fantastic, chicken or steak. It's the real deal, so be prepared to wait a little longer for one of these. ...  ... If you order anything other than a small, be prepared to have a second meal later.  ...  ... This place hides in a strip mall near the Brazilian Bull and Dunkin Donuts. Saving the 5th star because a place like this really needs to either stay open late or deliver for those sudden turkey cravings!

REVIEW #70:  3 stars  (303 chars)
A good above-average sandwich that I would probably enjoy more often if I had more reason to be in that part of town.  The radius of their sandwiches are ideal for eating as they aren't too wide, too tall,  or too sloppy.  The meats are good cuts and generous, their bread being the only real weak link.

REVIEW #71:  3 stars  (298 chars)
Eh. Nice employees but the sandwich was nothing special. Had the cole turkey. Wish it would have been sliced deli turkey instead of chunks of turkey. I had a little trouble finding the place because the sign is very small. Can't say that I'll be back since there are so many other options for subs.

REVIEW #72:  3 stars  (269 chars)
I had not been for quite awhile. The sandwiches are still very good but the "small" is much smaller than it used to be and the price has gone up quite a bit. $10+ for a small sandwich and small drink. My vote is to go 2 miles north to AZ sandwich co, much better value.

REVIEW #73:  3 stars  (270 chars)
I had the mushroom cheese steak sandwich and it was ok but not great. I split my sandwich in half so I could eat the rest later and I'm just not that excited about finishing it. It could just be that I'm not a huge fan of greasy food. I would probably not go here again.

REVIEW #74:  3 stars  (392 chars)
I went with a buddy who swears by the cheesesteaks. I opted for a turkey sandwich with coleslaw and swiss. I will say I was impressed that they roast whole turkeys here for the sandwicehs, so no thin processed turkey on teh sandwich. I would prefer if they baked their own bread, but that's not a huge deal. I ordered the "small" sandwich, that was stil huge! all in all, good turkey sandwich

REVIEW #75:  3 stars  (430 chars)
I'm a big fan of sub sandwiches, so I was excited to try this place. While I feel like the ingredients are definitely quality, the one thing I can't get past is the use of a sweet slaw as an ingredient instead of lettuce. I am not a fan of sweet coleslaw and much prefer a vinegar slaw. Even salt can't help me out. So, if you like sweet coleslaw, I think you'll really like these subs. But if not, this isn't going to thrill you.

REVIEW #76:  3 stars  (597 chars)
Initial appearance is clean.  No public restroom. Simple menu. Friendly employees.  ...  ... This was my first time, so I had some questions on the menu.  Employees explained with a smile.  ...  ... I had the capristrami. Pastrami, cole slaw, and their Russian sauce. Tastes great. Just shy of $8.  ...  ... So, with a small sandwich and a drink, the damage was about $11.   ...  ... Overall, for the money and the sandwich....I would have rather went to subway to save a couple bucks.  ...  ... So, nothing too special. If your in the area, great.....But I wouldn't go outta my way for the place.

REVIEW #77:  3 stars  (1054 chars)
My friends said that if I'm looking for an amazing deli, I had to try Capriotti's. There are many cultural differences between the east and west coast - one of them is the definition of a deli sandwich. This place makes SUBS - not deli sandwiches.  ...  ... If you are looking for an upgrade to Subway, go here! If you are looking for that classic Italian deli with amazing fresh bread and an interesting range of topping and condiment options, I guess you have to go out of state, as I just have not found it in Phoenix. ...  ... I ordered the 20 inch italian - it sounded naughty. :) The roll was fresh and doughy with a slightly crunchy crust. The meat was extremely high grade deli fixings - salami, peppered ham, and some other italian salami, roasted peppers, pickles, and viniagarette. For being a sub sandwich, all three of us enjoyed it fully. BUT, it's not a deli sandwich - it's a sub. ...  ... The gentlemen behind the counter were SO NICE - I would come back just to talk to them again because it was like they were all one big happy family.

REVIEW #78:  3 stars  (504 chars)
Sandwich shop is just OK.  Did not like the fact that they handed me my sandwich before requesting payment.  Quality of my Grilled Italian sandwich was OK.  My friends Ham and Cheese sandwich was not good.  Opened up the Ham and Cheese and it was in two parts.  Then folded the sandwich together and took one bite and it all fell apart and was very hard to hold and eat.  Place is at a good location, but service OK, & food quality OK.  Better sub shops in town to eat at, Jason's Deli or Sidewinders. =|

REVIEW #79:  3 stars  (93 chars)
Sandwiches are great but both times the service hasn't been good... Kinda leaves a bad taste.

REVIEW #80:  3 stars  (791 chars)
The bobbi sandwich rocks my world. Leftover thanksgiving turkey sandwiches are my absolute favorite.. and Capriotti's has them all year round. Massive chunks of turkey (none of that deli slices shit, actual turkey breast), cheese, mayo, CRANBERRY SAUCE. Gianormous piece of deliciousness.  ...  ... I don't care to order anything else but the bobbi. I have tried, nothing else on that menu is equally delicious. Best cold sandwich you will ever try. ...  ... Advice: Avoid lunch hour, its crazy busy and takes forever to get your order (hence the 3 stars). Don't dine in. They only have 3 tables in there and it doesn't add anything to the experience. Not cheap either, when compared to jason's deli or subway. 7-8$ easily... which is why I come here for something I can't get anywhere else.

REVIEW #81:  3 stars  (1035 chars)
The sandwiches were made to order, the aroma of the food cooking on the hot grill teasing my nostrils, this place is legit. ...  ... You get to choose most of the sandwiches from Small, Medium, and Large.  I ordered Mediums, thinking of Subway ... but the sandwiches were much bigger.  They say the medium is 12" long, but they seem longer than subways 12" (hey, no laughing) ...  ... Ordered several sandwiches: ... Capastrami ... Cran-Slam Club ... Chicken Cheese Steak ... Homemade Meatball Sub ...  ... Demanding a bite of each, the two that I liked a lot were the Capastrami & the Cran-Slam Club.  The Capastrami had thick tender slices of hot pastrami that was full of flavor, had a nice pink color, and wasn't dripping with oil (like some places).  The Cran-Slam club had fresh slow-roasted Turkey that was super moist and delicate, not dry and brittle. ...  ... I heard that they will be opening locations near my house which is good.  Once that happens, I won't be as jealous about my cousins living so close to this location.

REVIEW #82:  2 stars  (905 chars)
Disappointed...read how 'great' this place was.  How can you offer meatball subs and not have meatballs, but be told "we can put marinara on a sandwich if you want"? ...  ... Visited for the 1st time today...very disappointed: ... - 1st of all no meatballs ... - dirty tables and no wait staff cleaning them; had to do it ourselves ... - really small trash cans jammed to the brim - nasty! ... - food, napkins on floor - gross ... - no condiments available (you have to ask) ... - one napkin holder on the main counter...come on... ... - some high school kid taking orders/cooking with a wild 'fro and almost no hair netting...nasty II ...  ... The guy that owns this needs to go visit Fore Father's in Tempe to see a clean, well run operation.  Fore Father's cheesesteaks are delicious compared to this dump. ...  ... Off my list for good, I am not going back and cannot recommend this place to anyone...

REVIEW #83:  2 stars  (225 chars)
I ate "The Bobbie" which the girl said was their most popular. Well I guess I'm not a conformist excuse it was a fairly bland sandwich that basically just takes like canned shredded turkey and chewy bread. ...  ... Not a fan.

REVIEW #84:  2 stars  (315 chars)
I don't think this place is new, but they definitely don't have their stuff together. When I go to the one in central Phoenix they have my sandwich ready by the time I fill my drink. I don't expect that but this was unbelievably slow. Wheat bread is gross here too, It looks they just got it from the grocery store.

REVIEW #85:  2 stars  (858 chars)
I must agree with some of the other reviewers, that the place is nice and all but the sandwiches are nothing special. I mean they are very basic, and there is nothing wrong with that, but if I want a basic sandwich I will make it myself. The reason for the poor star quantity is the fact that if I had to choose between this place and Subway, I'd choose the latter because it's cheaper and tastier - and that isn't what you want to hear if you are in the cutthroat making-sandwiches-industry.  ...  ... I truly went in here to test something new, and it was around lunch and could go for a sandwich (I mean really, when could you NOT go for a sammie.. right?!). Middle of the road. Not bad, far from amazing. I wouldn't bother.  ...  ... Service was decent though. All smiles and an interest to serve, but smiles and intentions a good sandwich does not make.

REVIEW #86:  2 stars  (662 chars)
I've stopped in here periodically over the last several years and see a recurring theme.  ...  ... On my last visit I wait 20 minutes for two sandwiches. I tried to be patient, thinking that all the customers coming through the door had placed phone orders. Finally had to ask where my food was...the guy who took my order either lost it or tossed it. They took it again and I waited another 10 mins for them to fix it. When it was finally ready I didn't even get a discount, a free drink or comp'd meal...not even a "we're sorry".  Not terribly surprised.  ...  ... Four stars for the food, 1 star for service, 1 star for cleanliness....averages out to 2 stars.

REVIEW #87:  2 stars  (164 chars)
spotty hours, food is incredible but I really do not understand how they can run out of bread. Kind of like going to McDonalds and not being able to order a burger.

REVIEW #88:  2 stars  (603 chars)
Visited Capriotti's today for a Cheesesteak. ...  ... When I walked in during lunch hour literally no one was present behind the counter.  After waiting a bit less than five minutes an employee emerged from the back and took my order.   Little by little after that employees continued to emerge from the back and finally the manager.  I doubt whatever spill they mentioned to me would have required the entire restaurant's staff to clean. ...  ... Strangely today the shop wasn't busy nor were all the tables taken as usual. ...  ... Aside from the strange service experience the sandwich was wonderful.

REVIEW #89:  1 stars  (2023 chars)
DO NOT EAT HERE ...  ... This is by far the worst excuse for a sandwich shop, or any restaurant for that matter, that I have ever been to.  I have been here 3 times now and 2 of the 3 have been absolutely awful.  First time was ok, nothing spectacular but at least the food was decent.  The second time was much worse and the third time was the last straw for me.  I ordered a turkey sandwich.  The guy working the register didn't give me change so instead of canceling the transaction and reopening the register he decided to give me money out of his own wallet and told me "he'd make it up in tips".  OK.  Also told me to get a free drink for the inconvenience, which I declined.  Literally 4 more people came in, ordered, and all got their sandwiches (1 of which was wrong so he also was offered a free drink for inconvenience) before I got mine.  Two of the orders before me were hot so they had to cook on the flattop.  I spoke up and asked what the deal was.  Everyone looked at each other like I was the crazy one when finally a guy, who I'm assuming was the manager, appeared from the back and gave me a refund upon my request.  Two out of three times these morons messed up my order and I will never eat here again.  I tell all my friends and coworkers not to eat here and now I am telling you DO NOT EAT HERE.   ...  ... I would give this rat hole zero stars if possible.  Look around and you will see filthy floors, grease stains behind the cook station, public restrooms where they prepare the turkey.  The restrooms are literally in the kitchen.  You have to walk thru the prep station to use them.  Are you kidding me?  How is this sanitary?  This place and all of the people who work here disgust me. ...  ... Finally, if the owner or store manager somehow comes across this post I would highly recommend a turnover in employees because the ones who work this store are incompetent and are also costing you money by handing out free drinks and not zeroing out register transactions.   ...  ... DO NOT GO HERE

REVIEW #90:  1 stars  (497 chars)
So dissapointing! I ordered the club that claims to be "piled high" with turkey ham lettuce mayo and cranberry sauce... Triple decker style.  I opened my sandwich and thought I had been given the wrong one. It was as tall as a sandwich with only 2 pieces of bread which was the first bad sign considering there was a 3rd piece of bread in there. The turkey was ok but the ham was minuscule and looked like Walmart pressed ham... Yuck! And the lettuce; one little sliver of iceberg. Waste of money!

REVIEW #91:  1 stars  (305 chars)
They didn't have the meat for the sandwich I ordered. So I ordered another sandwich, which was cheaper and they didn't refund me the difference. Both my mom's sandwich and mine was dry and the bread stale. Oh yeah, and I found many small bones in my sandwich as well. DO NOT RECOMMEND. WIll NEVER go back.

REVIEW #92:  1 stars  (323 chars)
Totally overrated... the subs are nothing special with flavor or quality. Yes, better than subway but there are WAY better sandwich places - Quiznos is better and I don't go there either unless someone else insists.  There are at least 5 better places, not even considering grocery stores have better quality and selection!

REVIEW #93:  1 stars  (800 chars)
VEGANS, BEWARE!  ...  ... When I first started going here I asked specific questions about the "veggie" meat, Was it Vegan? Did it contain any dairy or egg? etc.  ... I was assured that it was absolutely vegan and a 100% soy product.  ...  ... I recently heard that their "veggie" meat contained egg whites.  ... I called up and asked them to please look at the ingredient list to verify this and sure it enough it contained Egg Whites!!  ...  ... I am so upset that that the owner/manager of this shop was so ignorant  that he could profess the vegan wonders of this "veggie" meat to me knowing that it was not.  ...  ... I'm appalled by the false pretense and all the times I ate here unknowingly putting things in my body which are not OK with me.  ... What if I had been deathly allergic to eggs?

REVIEW #94:  1 stars  (302 chars)
Well we had about 6 people in our group order sandwiches... Watched 8 people order after us and get their sandwiches before any of us. Don't know what the logic in that is as I've been waiting 20 minutes for a sandwich and have watched over 10 people come and go within 5 minutes...  ...  ... Horrible.

4.6/5 Excellent sandwich, got the Italian and was very impressed by the quality of the meat they used. Come hungry, the 12 inch here is a lot more food than the 12 inch at subway. Says voted best sandwich in America, definitely a contender.

all sandwiches are great and so is the staff, and the place is very clean, buy a deal  ... on double takes.  THE BEST SANDWICHES.

REVIEW #3:  5 stars  (1046 chars)
Beer, football and an awesome sandwich. Sounds like this is heaven for a bunch of men that I know. The interior is like half Subway and half sports bar. ...  ... I've only had the veggie sub sandwiches...the veggie cole turkey is one of my favorite sub sandwiches ever, but ask for no mayo on it or the mayo in the cole slaw and the mayo and Russian dressing they put on it will over-mayo the sandwich. ...  ... I thought for awhile that the Bobbie could be made veggie, but technically, the stuffing is made with a meat broth, so nope. I suppose you could get it without the stuffing...cuz who doesn't love cranberry sauce on their fake turkey? It's definitely worth a try. Yum! ...  ... The veggie steak and cheese is good too if you're in the mood for a warm sub...definitely add the peppers to it to make the chewyness of the fake meat fade into the chewyness of the peppers. It helps, trust me. ...  ... Overall, these are great subs. If I want a sub sandwich, I come here. There's nowhere else that has good veggie meat options like these!!

REVIEW #4:  5 stars  (932 chars)
Capriotti's is a stand-out sandwich shop -- I try to get there at least once a week.   ...  ... My favorites are the Capistrami and the Cole Turkey.  The ingredients are always fresh and the sandwiches are consistently made (you can always ask for less mayo, russian dressing and/or coleslaw on the sandwich, if you wish).  While it may be a little pricier than some other sandwich places, it is well worth it (as they say, you get what you pay for). ...  ... The staff is always friendly (and typically remember regular patrons) and flat screen televisions are throughout the establishment.     ...  ... As an iced tea drinker, I appreciate the fact that China Mist teas are available at Everything Bagels (which literally is attached to Capriotti's and is a fine bagel shop in its own right). ...  ... Finally, you definitely should sign up for Capriotti's text message deals -- they are sent out quite often and offer good deals.

REVIEW #5:  5 stars  (1193 chars)
Capriottis's ... You haven't had a sandwich until you have a Capriottis ...  ... Capriotti's Sandwich Shop is definitely the place to go for a good bite to eat. I would recommend Capriottis to anyone who is searching for something beyond "Just a Sandwich Shop". Capriottis is very clean and warmly decorate. The Staff is knowledgeable and very friendly. ...  ... On my first visit to Capriottis I had the "Bobbie" which is one of Capriottis signature sandwiches and for good reason. The Bobbie is stuffed full of homemade turkey (that's right, homemade roasted turkey, not processed deli meat), cranberry sauce, stuffing, and mayo. The 'Bobbie" sandwich was amazing to say the least. If turkey isn't for you Capriotti's offers a variety of traditional deli sandwiches, cheese-steaks, as well as specialty sandwiches. I plan on trying the cheese steak on my next visit. ...  ... The service at Capriottis is always fast & friendly. The atmosphere reminds me of that of a small-town deli sandwich shop and the food is always consistent and great. I could keep writing everything I enjoyed but I think I have given you enough to try Capriotti's for yourself! Who knows maybe I will see you there!

REVIEW #6:  5 stars  (288 chars)
Great food, great, friendly staff. My NEW favorite? The 12" cheesesteak with mushrooms, onions, hot peppers and sweet peppers, with a little mayo. (loaded as they say!). The bread could be a little better, but the cheesesteak more than makes up for it. I'll be back this weekend for sure!

REVIEW #7:  5 stars  (328 chars)
Great sandwiches and friendly service!  The Capistrami and cheesesteak are my 2 favorites but all the sandwiches are great here.  ...  ... Sign up for the text message deals-you'll be happy you did.  ...  ... Forget subway- capriottis is worth the few extra bucks for fresh quality ingredients that you can taste in every bite!!

REVIEW #8:  5 stars  (1271 chars)
Having already had lunch & just out running regular errands this afternoon i came up to a big billboard that said, "Voted Greatest Sandwich in America - Turn here!" ...  ... After thinking about this ostentatious command for about a block I whipped a U just to go for a look.  I'd never heard of this place or noticed it before but these people certainly aren't lacking confidence! ...  ... Posted inside was an easy to read & understand menu.  Their sandwiches come in 6", 12" & 20" sizes and the Capastrami 12" Sub sounded so good from the ingredients that I decided to go ahead & try one.  It comes with hot Pastrami, Cole Slaw, Swiss Cheese and Russian Dressing on some kind of terrific roll. ...  ... Soon my sandwich, completely & tightly wrapped up was ready.  I was already impressed by how big & heavy it was when I picked it up from the counter! ...  ... Back at my table, I had to see if this huge thing was anywhere near as good as they suggested on the billboard. ...  ... OMG, this was not just the best sandwich I've ever had, it might have been the best ANYTHING I've ever eaten!  It was just absolutely, positively 5 Stars out-of-this-world AMAZING, & the service was great too!     :-))     :-)) ...  ... World's best ANYTHING:  $8.99.  Grab your keys!!

I came I saw I got the pastrami and it torn it up! Love this place

REVIEW #10:  5 stars  (329 chars)
Love this place! Great food, friendly staff. Comfortable atmosphere inside and large patio outside. Ordered the Capistrami, my "go to" favorite. The Italian and Bobbie are close seconds. Great food , great staff, clean, comfortable dining area with 3 TV's with ESPN and CNN always playing. Seriously, what more could you ask for?

REVIEW #11:  5 stars  (63 chars)
That Cheesesteak sandwich is a titillating party in your mouth.

REVIEW #12:  5 stars  (1365 chars)
This place is by far my FAVORITE sandwich shop!! My husband and I saw the billboard for it and we are always looking for new places to try out.  We stopped in for our first visit and ate there, other two visits we ordered online and just picked it up.   Super easy and our orders are usually ready for pick up in 10 - 15 mins after submitting our order. The inside is pretty small and the chairs are uncomfortable, but its not intended for long stays anyways, its a sub shop.  I had the slawbejoe and my husband had the cheesesteak.  I am very picky about my slaw so I was a little nervous ordering this, but it is so good that we have gone back three different times now with the intention of trying different items and I keep getting the slawbejoe! The slaw was perfect (in my book!) it was juicy, sweet and tangy, fresh and crispy.  The meat was tender and fresh as well.  Bread...FRESH!!  My husband thought his cheesesteak was just o.k. (granted he asked for no mushrooms and no peppers, that my friend's is no cheesesteak! ;)  lol).  The second time around he ordered the Italian and talked about how awesome it was the whole time eating it, so did my sister in law.  I plan on trying the Bobbie next time around...if I can talk myself out of the slawbejoe!   I love the sandwiches!!  If you haven't been to Capriotti's, get your butt in there and eat a sub!!

REVIEW #13:  5 stars  (288 chars)
We love Capriotti's!  I think my husband would eat here every day if he could.  The subs are huge and are filled with lots of good ingredients.  Try the italian sausage sandwich, phili cheese steak, and meatball.  We also joined the text club to get things like free upgrades and cookies.

REVIEW #14:  5 stars  (624 chars)
Woot Woot! A new Caps opened in Phoenix and guess what they are Great! Spectacular! Fantastic! I got the Chicken Cheese steak and it was deli-sh. The Bobbie is my go to but I wanted something hot tonight. This location is across the street from the Sunbrite Corner shops. As with most Capriotti's stores there are the Sandwiches, Salads, fresh baked goods, chips and unlimited soda refills.There are a few parking spots in the front and many more in the back pretty soon their on-line ordering system will be up. In the meantime enjoy this new Capriotti's location. Almost forgot they service Beer and wine at this location.

REVIEW #15:  4 stars  (819 chars)
Capriotti's is my go to place when I am hungry and don't have time to leave the office for lunch, I love that I can order online and in about 15-20 minutes lunch has arrived!  I used to order from Jimmy John's all the time, but they have lost my business to the new kid on the block. ...  ... Jimmy John's is so skimpy with their meat, but Capriotti's loads up their sandwiches for a filling lunch.  The Bobbie with pulled turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce and mayo is so good, or if I am in a red meat kind of mood, they make a good cheesesteak, not traditional, but still tasty.   ...  ... Another reason I have moved on from JJ's is that you can only get their brand of chips, which are not that great, and Cap's has most of the standards...I just wish they would carry Cheetos and then they would really be perfect!

REVIEW #16:  4 stars  (179 chars)
Great subs! I mean amazing and they are huge and full of fresh ingredients! I love the Italian. The only reason it gets 4 stars is the service. Very, very slow even on a slow day.

REVIEW #17:  4 stars  (137 chars)
I always get the Italian sub hot so I cannot comment on any of the other subs but my buddy from The Bronx swears by all their sandwiches.

REVIEW #18:  4 stars  (186 chars)
Medium cheesesteak with everything sweet. Excellent flavor, great portion size, friendly service. Food could be just a little warmer. Really enjoy the cheesesteak, as a Philadelphia boy!

REVIEW #19:  4 stars  (315 chars)
My first time going here I wasn't expecting much but it ended up being very good. The sub I ordered was HUGE! It was extremely filling. I thought there was no way I could finish it but it was to good to put down. There's alot of room for parking in the back which was nice and there's a little bagel shop next door.

REVIEW #20:  4 stars  (547 chars)
My office is right around the corner so you can imagine when a sign was posted that the best sandwich in America was coming to town I was thrilled. Parking sucked, but the sandwich was fantastic. I had the Bobbie and I liked it so much I told two people. I'm eager to try some of their other sandwiches that didn't make the best list and see how they stack up to my regular spot. Over all I was thoroughly impressed with the food and the atmosphere was pretty nice for your run of the mill sandwich spot.  ...  ... Next time I'll remember to walk.

REVIEW #21:  4 stars  (471 chars)
OMG! My sandwich was huge (9" is the smallest you can get and I suspect it was bigger than advertised. I got the firecracker turkey and it sure was fiery! The turkey is real turkey too! Not processed stuff... in fact, I came across 2 slivers of turkey bone while eating my sandwich -- so be careful! Despite the bones, it WAS delicious. I need to find a lunch buddy to split with in the future, so I don't gorge myself on the whole thing in one sitting, like I did today!

REVIEW #22:  4 stars  (189 chars)
Ordered two sandwiches to go. The food was freshly prepared, the bread was good. It wasn't quite as amazing as I remembered the Las Vegas location; but it was good and a smidgen closer. :-)

REVIEW #23:  4 stars  (66 chars)
Pretty decent sandwich shop! The staff is always friendly as well.

REVIEW #24:  4 stars  (394 chars)
There were a few sandwiches on the menu that looked appetizing, but I went with the small cheese steak sandwich. Good choice - quality meat and tasty cheese and onions, on a delicious roll. The bread could have been a bit warmer - I love fresh-baked bread - but it was pretty fresh. ...  ... I've heard the Bobbie is supposed to be amazing - Thanksgiving in a sandwich. I'll try that next time.

REVIEW #25:  4 stars  (53 chars)
These sandwiches are great!  Yummy!  Love the Bobby!!

REVIEW #26:  4 stars  (192 chars)
Was craving pastrami, yum!!! Will definitely be back, to get my sandwich fix...Service was great, parking in back was good. Just wish they were there when I used to live in the neighborhood...

REVIEW #27:  4 stars  (95 chars)
WOW! We both had great tasting sandwiches and the service is fast and friendly! Check them out!

REVIEW #28:  4 stars  (207 chars)
Yummy addition to our neighborhood. An upscale sandwich shop was badly needed. I had the Bobbie, their most popular sammy. Love the cranberry sauce and stuffing!! Just like you'd make at home. Don't miss it!

REVIEW #29:  3 stars  (617 chars)
Excellent sandwiches here!  ...  ... They always make my order exactly how I want it!  ...  ... However, I never eat inside the restaurant. The inside isn't very nice looking nor are the seats comfortable. If you're getting something to eat, get it to go. ...  ... Last time I was there it took about 20 minutes to make my sandwhich. There was no one there besides me. They had someone being trained at the time and he was preparing my sandwhich. I informed them that I was in a rush (flight to catch) and they apologized but kept the same, slow pace. ...  ... Very frustrating.  ...  ... Good food, so-so experience.

REVIEW #30:  3 stars  (186 chars)
Good sandwich shop and very friendly.....but good not great.  For sure going back to try some other sandwiches but it's not going to be something I crave because it was soooo phenomenal.

REVIEW #31:  3 stars  (105 chars)
Got the chopped Italian,  it's alright. I'll try a sandwich next time. I would give it another go though.

REVIEW #32:  3 stars  (238 chars)
I had lunch here today and was looking forward to it with all the awards they have received.  In my opinion the sandwich I had way to much cole slaw, you cannot even taste the meat.  If I were to go back and would say light on e cole slaw

REVIEW #33:  3 stars  (604 chars)
I was told this place was very good, and so I already had high expectations coming in.  ...  ... Boy, it wasn't as good as I hoped and thought it would be.  ...  ... I ordered an italian with hot peppers. Don't get me wrong, it was good. It just wasn't "great". The sandwhich had a lot of peppes. Very hot. But that's the way I like it. ...  ... Also, it was way overpriced.  ...  ... I also tried their turkey sandwhich. It was alright. A lot of bread.  ...  ... Everything is purchased seperatley. Chips, drinks,e tc. No "meals".  ...  ... The people were friendly. I'd rather go to Potbelly Sandwhich.

REVIEW #34:  3 stars  (541 chars)
Not great, but not bad, either.  Big kudos for being a sandwich shop with some vegetarian options.  I had the veggie steak sandwich with peppers and onions, and it wasn't bad.  Sandwiches are not as good as That's a Wrap, but then it's a chain, so I didn't expect the same level of care.  Prices are a bit high for sandwiches.  For a couple bucks more I could go to the Vig next door, and actually eat cheaper at the Vig for happy hour.   ...  ... The bagel shop that's attached is also 3-star.  Three bagel shops in a three-mile radius now.

REVIEW #35:  3 stars  (1054 chars)
One step up from Subway and much better than Jimmy John's if you're looking for a good warm sandwich, this is the place. Of course, I went during lunch rush hour and probably would have had much quicker service had I chosen another time. However, given the fact that they were slammed - MY ORDER WAS PERFECT. I went for the Cheesesteak and was very pleased with the sandwich. Regular size is 9 inches which is good for one person. The meat was good and the cheese was perfect - usually you get poor quality meat and too much cheese or the wrong kind of cheese. I added mushrooms and onions, which in my opinion, should come standard on a Cheesesteak, but didn't. I also had a side of hot peppers which really topped off the sandwich well. ... There's nothing bad I can say about this place other than they're just a smidge pricey for what you get - but definitely not to the point to where I won't return and try a different sandwich.  ... Don't have too high of expectations and you'll be well satisfied. It's a sandwich shop - NOT a gourmet restaurant.

REVIEW #36:  2 stars  (1223 chars)
Got a Cole Turkey and the Bobbie, because they roast their own turkeys in house, and The turkey meat itself was pretty good - the problem is that they drenched the turkey in so much mayo and Russian dressing and then the coleslaw had a lot of mayo in it, I had to pull out just the meat and actually dry the meat off ...  ... The amount of fat in the mayo, russian dressing, and coleslaw was insane I could feel my heart slowing looking at it,. after a couple paper towels of wipe down - there was very little actual meat on the sandwich (a medium) and it was mainly bread and sauce  ...  ... The bread was nothing special - this turned out to be highly disappointing, they certainly are not the best sandwich shop on the block much less the country ...  ... The Bobbie was also drenched in mayo but less so, and that one had more meat was better put together and the Mrs liked it ...  ... The cookies were just ok to me however the Mrs enjoyed the sugar one quite a bit  ...  ... Unlikely we will be back, if we ever do we will certainly ask for all sauces on the side ...  ... It is a shame because they have good quality turkey meat pulled from a real turkey and hide it with bad bread and sauces, sometimes less is more

REVIEW #37:  2 stars  (991 chars)
I feel like Will Ferrell in Elf on seeing the sign for World's Best Cup of Coffee: "You did it! Congratulations! World's best cup of coffee! Great job, everybody!" ...  ... And really, the Voted Best Sandwich in America sign is just like that. ...  ... It wasn't busy, but the girl at the counter seemed to be struggling. I overheard someone ask her what goes in a salad and her answer was "I don't know, salads aren't my thing." Then I watched her incorrectly ring up the man in front of me, who politely pointed out she was overcharging him. Eek. ...  ... I got the turkey sub, which isn't your typical deli sliced turkey, but more like the stuff you have after Thanksgiving. I like it in concept, but it had a funny sweet flavor that wasn't working for me. The toppings on the sub were nothing special, and overall my sandwich didn't have much filling or flavor. I was eating at home, so I dressed it up myself. ...  ... The two stars come from the shop being tidy and the speedy service.

REVIEW #38:  2 stars  (696 chars)
I was driving around, looking for a place to eat lunch after a long hike, and was excited to see a sign for Capriotti's, claiming it was voted the "best sandwiches in America". I ordered an Italian Sausage (hot sandwich). I was a little confused when I unwrapped it and saw just sliced Italian sausage on a bun. That was it. I started wondering if I had missed a crucial part of the ordering process (was there a list of toppings I was supposed to choose from?). Who knows. The sandwich was OK, but didn't live up to my expectation of "best sandwich in America". Despite my disappointment, I will likely give them another chance. Service was friendly and the cookie was the best part of the meal.

REVIEW #39:  2 stars  (638 chars)
Id give you three stars, but I tried you guys again this week and the same things happen. The food quality here for a good sub is fantastic. However, the staff can never seem to get an order correct. There is always something I didn't ask for, or specifically asked to not be on my sub. I've also waited over 15-20 minutes on a slow day for a hot sandwich. I even tried ordering online once and it told me it would take over 90 minutes so I called and cancelled. I really want this place to get better, because we need an amazing sub shop!!!  ... Their selection of teas rocks and the bagel place is delicious next door for early birds :)

REVIEW #40:  2 stars  (1636 chars)
Meh -  ...  ... I've been to this location twice.  Each time it was sort of disappointing...  I live in Ahwatukee and that location ROCKS so maybe they could learn from them?? ...  ... I called ahead and placed my order so I wouldn't have to wait.  When I arrived, there was a line so I walked up to the side of the counter where people picked up their order.  I said I'd called it and needed to pick it up, but I was directed to wait in line anyway.  Kind of disappointing since I'd called ahead.  I expected a call-in pick up line like most other places.  After waiting patiently in line, I picked up my order and ran back to the office. ...  ... As I ate my sandwich, I couldn't help be disappointed.  This was not anything like the ones I was used to getting in Ahwatukee.  I ordered my usual, the chicken cheese steak w/grilled mushrooms and onions, sweet peppers on the sandwich and hot peppers on the side.  They'd forgotten the hot peppers, not that big of a deal, but there was hardly any mushroom, onion or sweet peppers either.  The cheese was skimpy and the meat was dry and overdone.  What a bummer!   ...  ... The other time I'd visited this location was not as bad as this - but still not as good at the Ahwatukee location.  There they are always consistent with great food and service.   ...  ... This location does have a connecting bagel shop that has 6 different kinds of iced tea.  This was the saving grace of the meal - but now I am forced to sit at my desk and look at the trademarked slogan on the cup "Extraordinary Food for those unwilling to settle!"  Unfortunately today's meal was even less than ordinary...

REVIEW #41:  2 stars  (1291 chars)
My husband and I went to try it out after driving by for weeks. They claim that it was voted the best sandwich in America. We don't know who voted but we suspected it was the staff because I can't imagine that anyone who had been to Chicago or New York or even to Quizno's would say that. We had the Bobbie and the Capastrami at the suggestion of the girl at the register. She said they were their most popular. Neither were what we would call a great sandwich much less the best. Both sandwiches relied too much mayonnaise to give them some semblance of flavor. The Bobbie was basically Thanksgiving leftovers on a bun and not that great a bun. The cranberry sauce tasted like it was canned. The stuffing couldn't even compete with Stauffer's. It was boring. The Capastrami was a bit better but only a bit. It would have been better if they had better bread. The swiss cheese wasn't strong like a good swiss but tasted like the presliced cheese in the packages hanging on the rack in the grocery store. The pastrami was mild, once again no better than what you'd get at the grocery store. The cole slaw was unremarkable and again - too much mayo. With outstanding sandwiches like those from Bertha's Cafe and Cheese 'N Stuff in Central Phoenix, don't waste your time or money on this place.

REVIEW #42:  2 stars  (266 chars)
Staff was friendly but the sandwhich was just horrible. The meat was soggy and had a texture that was so unappealing.  I am pretty sure I enjoyed the same sandwich in Vegas but boy was it different here. Staff gets 4 stars and food gets a half for a two star review.

REVIEW #43:  2 stars  (372 chars)
Very disappointed with service!!! I've been in there a couple of times, love the food, but the little jerks they hired are horrible. Brad to be exact, was more interested in trying to sell me every desert then getting my order right. I would to love support Capriotti's Phoenix but not if i'm going to spend my hard earned money on something i didnt order and bad service!

REVIEW #44:  2 stars  (271 chars)
Well meaning staff could not make up for the chewy, lifeless and overpriced sandwiches.  Even the soda fountain was mediocre, with many of the concentrates either out or low.  My requests for replacements with met with indifference.  Other than that everything was great!

REVIEW #45:  1 stars  (268 chars)
My sandwich was bad. So bad, that I wonder if they screwed it up. It was just a simple turkey sandwich. It was extremely dry and not tasty at all. What was supposed to make this taste like America's best sandwich? The bread wasn't that good either. Will never go back.

REVIEW #46:  1 stars  (1198 chars)
The sandwiches are OK but the service is atrocious.  It is right down the street from my house so I have been in several time.  I like the vegetarian cheese burger but I don't eat cheese so I ask for it without the cheese.  Each time I have ordered it that way I have gotten a funny look.  Today, same funny look from the arrogant young server but what is new now is she says with disdain they do not serve a 12' veggie.  Funny you say that I have ordered it several times and it says on the menu they have all sizes but  the small comes on a kaiser role.  When I explain this she shrugs her shoulder and says she cannot order me a 12'.  Worst of all the server I ordered the same sandwich from the last time, just stares at me like oh well, we do have that but I am not going to say anything.  I walked out.  This is making sandwiches folks....it's not that hard. ...  ... This is a GREAT neighborhood and I will be at a block party tonight discussing my experience with my neighbors. Capriotti's corporate, if you want this place to make it, you better tell the manager (who is no better than his staff) to change his attitude or your sandwich shop will be back to a convenience store in no time.

REVIEW #47:  1 stars  (319 chars)
Wish i could put a big fat zero .  Stood in line for 15 mins to place an order for two italian subs and they have NO FREAKIN ITALIAN MEAT.  Its a wed for god sake.  How can you not have supplies. Not doing that ever again. Went across the street to Niccolis, they have better Italian anyway!!  Please ho somewhere else.

Amazing sandwhich joint. A must go place to eat!

REVIEW #2:  5 stars  (502 chars)
AWESOME SANDWICH SHOP! It reminds me of Bruchis in my home town. My boyfriend is from Delaware which is where Capriottis is based so I'd been eager to try it from everything he had told me. Capriottis certainly didn't disappoint! We split both the cheesesteak and The Bobbie (Capriottis is famous for this sandwhich- shredded moist turkey, chunky cranberry sauce and homemade cornbread stuffing on flaky bread). And if you're really hungry the large size is 18 INCHES!!! ...  ... I'm absolutely hooked!

Good God, the Capastrami was the best damn sandwich I have had in recent memory. The Bobbie was nothing to scoff at either. If you love sandwiches then you CANNOT pass on this spot.

REVIEW #6:  5 stars  (373 chars)
Good sandwiches at decent prices, considering the portion size. Friendly staff, clean restaurant. My favorites are the Italian, Capistrami and the meatball sub. 9" sub is plenty for one person, 12" is big enough to share. The Bobbie is good as well, fresh roasted and pulled turkey. I was told they roast 3-6 turkeys overnight, ever night. Can't get much fresher than that!

Great. Just ate at the one in scottsdale downtown and ordered a steak sandwich. I have a big appetite and the medium size was huge and just right. Good sandwich. I recommend. Now if they could make some cheese fries with gravy that would just be even better. hint

My husband brought me here.  Here after he had been a couple times and he knew exactly what we were going to have...the 20" cheese steak with sweet peppers, hot peppers and mushrooms.  We of course split it.  It was awesome.  One of the best cheese steaks I have ever had.  It doesn't seem to be that busy in the evening, which is when we went.  That was nice, we didn't have to stand in line and got our food right away.  This place is nice change from the usual.

Capriottis came into the local market not too long after I moved here from Vegas.  I was very happy to see them here as I need to feed my Sandwich addiction from time to time.  This location is the nicest and largest Capriotti's I've ever seen....and I love it! ...  ... I had the 12" Italian Sandwich w/Hot Peppers, $8.49 and added Chips for $.99. ... http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/capriottis-sandwich-shop-scottsdale?select=EyClKSbI5ui45ICOgtZN8w#EyClKSbI5ui45ICOgtZN8w ... http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/capriottis-sandwich-shop-scottsdale?select=2VZnwSnZBXzZq-S1FwglWw#2VZnwSnZBXzZq-S1FwglWw ... http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/capriottis-sandwich-shop-scottsdale?select=C4MUzxU6nmBQbWBk-Y20tw#C4MUzxU6nmBQbWBk-Y20tw ...  ... The Sandwich tasted just like the Sandwiches in Vegas...so it's consistent across their stores.  My favorite topping is the Hot Peppers....they're legitimately hot, which is how I like it.  I can't stand it when Sandwich shops advertise "Hot" Peppers when in fact they're really mild. ...  ... The employees here are friendly and keep the place clean. ...  ... Return Factor - 90%

Capriottis reminds me a lot of Jimmy Johns. Basic sandwhiches that are delicious. I had there Steak Sandwhich and it came out to me steaming hot. It was really good and well worth checking out. I will be back.

REVIEW #19:  4 stars  (328 chars)
Capriottis sandwiches are incredible.  I've been there many times and still venture back to their hot pastrami.  It's just so good.  The prices aren't terrible considering you get a 9" sub, a drink and a bag of chips for $10.50.  It's not subway for-gosh-sakes.  I love capriottis.  Their hot sandwiches are my go to.  pastrami.

REVIEW #20:  4 stars  (255 chars)
Don't waste your time on any other sandwich than the cole-turkey.  Coleslaw, russian dressing, provolone, and fresh/REAL roasted turkey, all on a hearty roll.  Portions are huge, pricing is moderate, and otherwise this is just your average sandwich joint.

Got their chicken cheesesteak sandwich which I was happy to see since I don't eat beef.  Not the best one I've ever had (phillies best in CA is best outside Philly) but pretty good. The hot peppers were actually spicy.  Loved that! Friendly service.

I go here every chance I get! Usually eat the Italian sausage sandwich, loaded and it never fails to satisfy like those sandwiches I had yesteryear growing up in Iowa(Raymond's in Clear Lake). Give it a shot, they have a large menu and fast service!

REVIEW #26:  4 stars  (1436 chars)
I have purchased many sandwiches from this Capriotti's location, specifically,  I love the Italian Combo.  I am writing to apologize to Capriotti's for my unfaithfulness.   ...  ... Today I was on 33rd Street and Bell shopping at Harbor Freight with my husband and saw a place called Jimmy John's.  I had heard that they were also a sandwich shop and competitors to Capriotti's.  So despite the fact that I adore Capriotti's sandwiches, I strayed.  I bought Jimmy John's version of Capriotti's italian combo.  I asked for it with hot peppers just as I do at Capriotti's.  When I started to eat it at home, I noted that I did not like the texture of the bread.  I also noted that the amount of cold cuts was much less than Capriotti's not to mention the fact that it was missing the all important pepperoni.  Capriotti's sandwich has ham that has a black pepper crust around it as well making it super delicious.  Jimmy John's did give me hot peppers, but all in all I did not enjoy the sandwich from JJ's. ...    ... I was unfaithful Capriotti's.  Forgive me.I succumbed to the closeness of the Jimmy John's store, intoxicated by the fact that the sandwich was cheaper, by the niceness of the employees and by the fact that I didn't have to wait for my sandwich.  I was wrong.  I should have been more faithful, more disciplined, less impulsive.  Forgive me Capriotti's--- I will never do this again!!!! I shall be faithful from now on.

I love Capriotti's! I used to go to them a lot in Vegas when I lived there. Then I saw a coming soon sign for them and all most crashed my car rubber necking to make sure I wasn't seeing things. After not having any for almost 2 years I was so excited to walk-in to a Capriotti's. I was not disappointed! ...  ... The food is great and I highly recommend the Bobbie or the Capastrami!! ...  ... Only down side is there a bit pricey. In the end it's worth it and I'm very happy I don't have to drive 4.5 hours anymore to get a specialty sub.

REVIEW #28:  4 stars  (941 chars)
I loved the sandwiches at the Mesa Capriottis, so I decided to try one of the North Scottsdale locations for lunch. I phoned in my order, and although it was a little hard to understand the gentleman on the phone becausehewastalkingreallyfastlikehowIamwriting, I had no problems getting my order in.  ...  ... When I arrived, my sandwiches hadn't been made quite yet, but it didn't take too long for them to finish making them. The "small" 9 inch size is huge! If I weren't such a pig, I could have been satisfied with half of my small size sandwich.  ...  ... I love their faux turkey sandwiches, so I went for the regular vegetarian turkey sandwich. The ingredients were fresh, and while I liked the cole-turkey version better, it was pretty good, and especially refreshing for a hot summer day! ...  ... The soda fountain has Pepsi products, and has diet Mountain Dew as well as diet Pepsi. ...  ... Overall, a good choice for a sandwich.

REVIEW #29:  4 stars  (573 chars)
I really love the variety that Capriottis offers, especially with their focus on using Thanksgiving-esque ingredients in their selections. The Cran Slam club is an unbeliveably delicious combination of ham, turkey and cranberry sauce that I would recommend hands-down as the number 1 menu item to anyone giving Capriottis a shot for the first time. ...  ... Honestly I haven't been blown away by the more standard menu items (I've had a tuna sandwich and turkey sub that were both so-so) but the Capriottis originals more than make up for the less spectacular alternatives.

REVIEW #30:  4 stars  (875 chars)
I'm basically a chain-hater (well, I dont hate them, but I try to avoid them). ... Capriottis is an exception. ... This delicious sandwich shop has some of the best sandwiches I've  had for the type of establishment that it is: a chain sandwich shop. ... The Bobbie, which is made of freshly roasted turkey (I've seen the big hunks that didn't get chopped), cranberry sauce, stuffing and a hint of mayo is fabulous! ... The capastrami is a delightful combination of hot pastrami, swiss cheese, russian dressing and cole slaw, and wonderful in taste. ... You can choose the size of sandwich you want, as well! ... Capriotti's also has salads, and a host of other sandwhich selections, which are consistently delicious and fresh. ... Their personnel are very friendly, the prices are very reasonable, and it can be the best quick sandwich you've ever had...you just have to go!

REVIEW #31:  4 stars  (532 chars)
I've tried the capastrami and the cole turkey, both are delicious!  They don't use sliced turkey on their sandwiches, they use shredded roasted turkey breast which is very nice.  It is a little bit pricey but the portions are huge compared to other sandwich places so it evens out.  You can definitely get two meals out of one small sub. ...  ... The staff is also very nice.  One time I had to wait for them to make a new batch of coleslaw to complete my sandwich and the manager offered me a free drink for having to wait so long.

REVIEW #32:  4 stars  (627 chars)
If you are going here, I'd suggest getting the Bobbie. That might make this a bit of a one trick pony for a sub place, but it is a good trick. ...  ... The Bobbie is turkey, cranberry, stuffing and mayo in a sub roll.  Turkey is great.  Cranberry good, though could have been spread more evenly.  The roll was soft and fresh.  Only complaint is the stuffing.  A good stuffing, possibly a oyster stuffing would put this bad boy over the top. ...  ... This is a post thanksgiving style comfort food beast.  Not a killer Italian sub with premium meats and toppings.  But it is a feast worthy of a pilgrimage when the craving hits.

REVIEW #33:  4 stars  (830 chars)
It's weird that that the reviews are so skewed for Capriottis Sandwich Shop. I have eaten here several times, and have enjoyed it each time. I think the thing that hurts them more than anything else is the "Best Sandwich In America" banner hanging out front. The sandwiches are really good... but best in America is a little far reaching. ...  ... That being said... I usually get the "Bobby"... Thanksgiving on a bun! It's a pretty damn good sandwich... it you like thanksgiving dinner. The turkey is freshly made, as is the stuffing they put on the sandwich.  ...  ... I have also had the meatball sub... also very good.  ...  ... I like this place. And I am pretty sure you will like this place.  ...  ... Make sure you tell them you signed up for their "text message" program to get a free drink and chips on your first visit.

REVIEW #34:  4 stars  (191 chars)
Just tried Capriottis, i was very impressed, great sandwich, i got the Pastrami signature sandwich they have. Tasty, Great bread...i'll be back for sure! bit pricey but hey, everywhere is now

REVIEW #35:  4 stars  (955 chars)
OMG this was one of the best sub sandwiches I have had in a really long time!  I had the opportunity to try a few things: 1) the black and bleu salad, which I had with the cranberry dressing.  It was really delicious and just what I was looking for. I also got to try the ham and cheese and the Italian. Both were fantastic. They used some kind of seasoning...an oil and vinegar maybe...that gave the sub such wonderful flavor. I am excited to try the Bobby next time. A friend of mine got it and she was very impressed that the bread was not soggy at all because of the cranberry sauce, but another friend said the cranberry sauce was a little too sweet. Personally I don't mind a little too sweet, but if you are sensitive to it, you might want to scrape some of the cranberry off or ask them to go light.  One con: I got a cookie and while it was delicious, I am not sure it was made there, and I really am a huge fan of cookies which are made on site.

REVIEW #36:  4 stars  (76 chars)
Sandwiches are very above average in taste, but they are on the spendy side.

REVIEW #37:  4 stars  (1451 chars)
Scottsdale is a tough crowd. I noticed all the other Capriotti's in the valley have a 4 star rating on Yelp and this location has a 3 star rating. ...  ... I've eaten at Capriotti's a lot since it has opened and have found that the sandwiches are consistently good and the service is great. A "small" sandwich is 9 inches, I wouldn't even contemplate ordering anything larger. And believe it or not they have a "medium" and a "large" sized sandwich. I really urge the corporate office to start serving 6 inch sandwiches in order to get the price point down. A sandwich and drink basically hits the $10 mark, which is a little too much for a fast food joint. ...  ... My Favorite sandwich is The Bobbie. It's like eating Thanksgiving Dinner in a bun. When I first tried this combination of cold turkey (real turkey), cranberry sauce and stuffing (hold the mayo) I thought no way this could be good. I was hooked once I took my first bite. Yum - a perfect combination of food, like eating Thanksgiving leftovers. I've enjoyed the Cran-Slam Club and The Italian Sausage sandwich as well. I'm determined to try the rest of the sandwiches, but I keep on returning to The Bobbie. ...  ... They have a couple of flat screens and seem to play a lot of "live" type songs from the Eagles, Beattles, Simon & Garfunkle, Springsteen, etc. A great place to sit back and chill.  ...  ... P.S. - Park in the Wal-Mart parking lot across the street to save your sanity.

REVIEW #38:  4 stars  (638 chars)
So I see all these negative reviews and, rather than deterring me from going back to Capriotti's, what are my thoughts? "Great, shorter lines for me!" Really, no joke. ...  ... Okay so in all fairness I only ever eat one thing here. Which never happens. Ever. Here though, I always get the Cran Slam Club, and it never, ever fails to satisfy. I think I may have tried something else at a different location years ago... but since I tried that club, there's been no going back. ...  ... Oh and to the person complaining about a limited selection of chips, quick tip: Go to the counter where you ordered...... look down. You're welcome. :-)

REVIEW #39:  4 stars  (518 chars)
Tasty sandwich.  I got the 9" Capastrami.  Pretty different flavors & textures than what I'm used to and it was soooo good!  The last thing we need is yet another version of Subway/Jersey Mike's/Jimmy John's etc etc.  The fresh baked and pulled meat is super delicious.  I had exceptional service.  Joe walked me through all the varieties of sandwiches and told me all about her favorites.  The two guys in the food prep area also both greeted me & wished me a good evening when I left.  Friendly, fast, overall great!

REVIEW #40:  4 stars  (181 chars)
The sandwiches are excellent and decently meaty.  I haven't tried any other items, but will in the future based on the quality of the sandwiches.  Service is friendly and efficient.

REVIEW #41:  4 stars  (55 chars)
The turkey, cranberry and stuffing sandwich is amazing.

REVIEW #42:  4 stars  (184 chars)
They claim the best sandwich in America. I'm going to agree that they are really really really good. They also deliver. The Bobbie, Cheese-steak, and the Capastrami are all crazy good!

REVIEW #43:  4 stars  (1238 chars)
To start, I've never actually been inside to place our order someone in the house usually brings home what we want so my review is mostly for the food. However, my family has said that all the people are very, very nice, throw in some extras and are helpful! ...  ... I have had the Homemade Turkey, Awesome! It really is thanksgiving turkey. I recommend that and also the meatball sub. Both very tasty. I have had the cheesesteak and I must say was not only lacking flavor but also they skimped on the meat! I mean come on, a cheesesteak should be satisfying and filling but where was the meat? It was all bread. Plus, it comes with white american cheese which I do not eat on a cheesesteak so I substituted it for provolone. They only offer provolone, white american or swiss. It would be nice if they offered cheddar for the kids and mozzarella. The bread is fresh, soft with a little bit of a toast to it. Very good. My son loves the kids turkey sandwich meal. The bread is great and the veggies are always fresh. You can definitely see the quality of ingredients and how fresh everything is. The guys even once threw in an extra juice box at no charge when they found out it was for a hungry little growing boy! Very cool you guys ;)

REVIEW #44:  4 stars  (1240 chars)
We discovered Capriotti's when we were looking for a vegetarian-friendly place to have lunch before a game at Scottsdale Stadium. What a great find! I hope we can someday hope to have a Capriotti's near our home in Santa Cruz, CA! ...  ... It's rare (read "virtually unheard of") to find a sandwich shop that does much more for vegetarians than a basic veggies and cheese sandwich, so we were astounded to have the additional options of veggie turkey with cheese, veggie turkey cole, and a veggie chicken cheese steak! The Capriotti's here uses veggie turkey made by Worthington's/Loma Linda, which any long-term vegetarian can tell you makes the best meat analogs in the business (in fact, my husband and I special order Worthington's canned chili by the case...it's just that good). ...  ... I had the veggie turkey cole, and it was really good...lots of yummy veggie turkey piled on a fresh sub roll (They have really good bread! Much better than Subway!) with provolone, cole slaw, and Russian dressing. My husband had the cheese steak, and was very pleased with his as well, though he did say that next time he would ask for it with more mayo. ...  ... I'm definitely a fan, and will definitely look out for Capriotti's when we travel!

REVIEW #45:  4 stars  (323 chars)
Went here last week and had a capastrami sandwich on the recommendation of a friend. It was really good and the people were very cool. Something about good pastrami and coleslaw with Russian dressing that is just awesome. There are alot of nice choices in this part of Scottsdale and this place will be one of my favorites.

REVIEW #46:  4 stars  (466 chars)
What an odd feeling to see Capriotti's in the bright sunshine of Scottsdale 25 years after getting take out from Capriotti's back in grungy old Delaware. The juxtaposition was at first a bit off-putting, but I drove right in and enjoyed a Capastrami sandwich just like it was yesterday. Only this time I got to walk out into the sunshine of Arizona vs. out into another rainy or cloudy day back east. It's a lot pricier than the old days, but still pretty darn good.

REVIEW #47:  3 stars  (194 chars)
Don't get your hopes up! Decent sandwich but nothing to brag about and definitely not the best in America. Had the Bobbie and Capastrami during two visits and they just fell short ... Too bad :/

REVIEW #48:  3 stars  (600 chars)
I work in an office nearby and we order from Capriotti's several times a month.  I usually get the Philly Cheesesteak and I really enjoy it.  You can order online and they give options of different things you can add at no charge or at a very minimal charge.  Their ordering system is good, the price is acceptable and the food is very tasty.  The delivery is an extra $1, but is worth it as I would rather chop off my own arm than drive around this area at lunch time.  Okay, that may be a bit of an exaggeration, but not by much.  We'll be ordering from them again in the next week or so, I'm sure.

REVIEW #49:  3 stars  (4096 chars)
I've rounded down on this one; from 3 1/2 Stars to just 3 Stars and you'll see why as you read below.   ...  ... I am a student of numbers.  Sorry, that's just what I do for a living.  So here are some numbers.  There are three Capriottis in the Valley according to Yelp.  The Phoenix location has 65 Reviews and a Four Star rating.  Tempe has 18 Reviews and a Four Star Rating.  And, Scottsdale has 21 Reviews and a Three Star rating.   ...  ... I'm sure this statistical proof will make my fellow Yelper, Scott D. very happy since he has stated that Scottsdale is a tough crowd.  Given my two dining experiences, I would say it has less to do with the Scottsdale crowd as it does with the folks behind the counter and the pricing of the sandwiches.   ...  ... I'm really in agreement with Yelper, Andrea K.  -- the employees bring down the overall Capriotti's experience.  On my first visit, everyone was surly behind the counter and ill tempered.  On this trip, I was just grossed out. ...  ... Last night, I visited Capriotti's around seven and ordered the medium Cheese Steak.  As I waited, I filled my drink and watched the Bulls v. Miami game on the big screen (nice touch!).   ...  ... After five minutes or so, I walked over and figured that my food would be ready soon.  As I waited, the guy in front of me had an order mix up -- something about ordering the 20" and getting the 12" instead.  I was surprised when they remade the order and told him to keep the extra sandwich.  Nice! ...  ... In front of the counter, on the employees side, was a pile of table scraps and garbage on the floor.  So I took a picture because I was killing time and thought it was amusing.  It looked as if someone was in the middle of cleaning the floor and just got distracted. Oh, well.   ...  ... My order came, and it too had a mistake.  Somehow it was made plain, instead of the works.  No matter, the manager told me he would remake the order.  Again, I thought you could just add onions and whatever.  But he said no problem and told me to come back in a few minutes.  So I walked over to my table and watched the Bulls make a run at Miami from being down five points.  Good game! ...  ... After five minutes or so of watching the game, I walked over again thinking my sandwich would soon be ready.  Yep, the pile of garbage was still there on the floor.  So, I took another picture.  The Manager was there and he told me it would just be a moment.  Incredibly, everyone was side stepping this pile of garbage.  Just then a kid came over with the sandwich and slipped on it.  Too funny.  The manager admonished him to watch it, I told him "it might be easier if you just clean it up." ...  ... So, it was back to the Bulls game, but now with my sandwich in hand -- twenty minutes after I had order it.  Okay, the sandwich was very good.  I liked it a lot better then my first experience with the brown meat, roast beef Slaw Be Jo.  The cheese and the onions were the right mix to the chopped meat.  And, the bread stood up well and had a corn meal bottom to it.  All nice!   ...  ... The Cheese Steak reminded me in many ways of the Jersey Mike's version of the same sandwich, which isn't a bad thing.  In the end, even though it was very good sandwich, I thought nearby Corleone's was slightly better.  Of course, Corleone's closes at seven so where could I find something this good at seven-twenty?  In the future, I really need to work on my time management. ...  ... Well, it was now seven forty-five and the Bulls were firmly in control of the game.  I went over to refill of my drink.  Yep, I looked.  And yep, the garbage and table scraps were still there on the floor. But now it was more spread out from the mishap with the kid.   ...  ... Okay, I'm done with Capriotti's for a while.  For $11.53, I will take my business elsewhere and remember that Corleone's closes early.  I'm going to agree with Dave S. on this -- it's an expensive sandwich, even by North Scottsdale standards.  But it's not a bad one!  It's just that the overall experience leaves much to be desired. ...  ... Sorry!

REVIEW #50:  3 stars  (650 chars)
If it was possible I would give 3.5 stars.  I rounded down because the first time I ordered from here they screwed up my sandwich (I ordered a cheese hero and they gave me a ham and cheese hero - ham-stink is permanent and since I detest ham, it was a whole sandwich killer). ...  ... Meatball hero was pretty good though I would not rush back to get another.  When I finally did get a cheese hero, it was delicious - this I would rush back to get.  Husband loves the Bobby. ...  ... The service is a little slow so I'm going to try ordering through their website the next time.  Capriottis has definitely earned a spot in my sandwich place rotation.

REVIEW #51:  3 stars  (681 chars)
On occasion I get the urge for a big old Italian grinder.  In my neighborhood I know exactly where to go to to satisfy this craving, but I have no clue where to go in North Scottsdale.  I took a chance on Capriotti's. ...  ... The restaurant was packed, but the staff was very efficient in getting food out.  Grinder in hand, I head back to work to try it out. ...  ... The sandwich was huge, easily big enough for two meals.  As for the flavor?  It was ok, but not exactly memorable. All of the components were there, but the sandwich as a whole didn't stand out. ...  ... I'm willing to try the 'Best Sandwich in America' at least once, but I won't be going back for the grinder.

On our receipt from yesterday's visit, we noticed: "Tell Us About Your Experience?"  ...  ... I blinked at the following question:  ... "Please tell us why you were not Highly Satisfied? Be as specific as you would like?" ...  ... Here was my cut 'n paste response: ...  ... "Please know, there are many choices in the area for sandwiches.  Jimmy John's, Corleone's, Jersey Mikes, Vermont Sandwich, just to name a few; along with Al's Beef and Luke's of Chicago (next door).  We rec'd a text upsize message and decided to give you another try.   ...  ... "On our first visit, the meat (roast beef) on your Slaw Be Jo was dark brown.  On our second visit, there was garbage on the floor. I still have the pictures and your employees did nothing, when I told them about it.  It was in the Prep area btw.  ...  ... "Last night, we ordered two upsized sandwiches which were very good... Meatball & the Bobbie, along with one drink.  But, $18.26 seems at least $4 too high and that is taking into account a larger sandwich.  I really, really want to like your place, but I find it hard given the above." ...  ... Okay, here's a funny aside...  At the end of their questionnaire, they asked which social media do I use.   ...  ... The usual suspects were there, such as Facebook, Twitter, My Space (who uses My Space anymore?) and Fick'er, but no Yelp.   ...  ... I had to write Yelp as "other". D'oh!!

REVIEW #53:  3 stars  (1748 chars)
So I've seen the "opening soon" sign for some weeks now and was excited for a new sandwich place in the neighborhood. After kicking my own booty at the gym I was starved and craving meat. I decided to negate my work out efforts and give Capriottis a try.  ...  ... I was really conflicted on whether I should go for the meatball or the Philly cheese steak. Cheese steak won. Small size with mushrooms and onions. And a small drink. Just under $11. I had to gasp for air as I felt like someone just punched me in the gut and mugged me. This better be way YUM!  ...  ... When the sandwich came out I calmed down a little about the price. The small is 9" (giving all other small subs out there major feelings of inadequacy) and turned into two meals for me. It reheated very well the next day, I might add.  ...  ... The sandwich was tasty. Nothing to write home about. I really like their bread. It's funny, the other guy complained not enough meat and I would really liked to have seen more mushrooms and onions in my sub. The onions are diced and very small so I had a difficult time detecting their flavor, same goes for the mushrooms.  ...  ... I was disappointed when they told me they didn't have malt vinegar. I love dipping my cheese steaks in that stuff. The guy suggested red wine vinegar and I was so desperate I tried it. It was pretty good. Still can't beat malt though. Hopefully they will get enough requests for it and add it to their inventory.  ...  ... It is obvious they just opened and are working out some kinks here and there. Totally understandable and nothing to give them a hard time about. I will be back for more.  ...  ... Oh! And they deliver! Since we don't have a JJ in delivery range I am thrilled about that fact. :)

REVIEW #54:  3 stars  (964 chars)
The "Best Sandwich in America" sign should probably be taken down.  Don't get me wrong; Capriottis isn't bad.  It's actually pretty good.  But the best?  Not even close.  I don't think I would even call it the best sandwich in the retail complex it's located in. ...  ... Having never eaten at any of this national chain's locations, I decided to go off the Cap's Special menu and order a Capastromi (a pastrami rueben sub).  The small is 9 inches, which is big enough for me.  The bread is soft and tasty, but the pastrami is a little over peppered, and it would've been nice if there were more meat.  Very good.  But not the "Best" of anything. ...  ... The employees were friendly.  The seating area is spacious and clean.  There's two TV's playing ESPN and CNN in mute.  There's also a few tables located right outside, which would be pleasant spots to eat on a nice day.  Caprioittis may not be the "best" that it boasts, but I would certainly eat here again.

REVIEW #55:  3 stars  (660 chars)
Two outta three aint bad, right?  Went in with my mom and my daughter, and of the three sandwiches we ordered, the Italian and the Cheesesteak (without cheese, btw...) were much better than my Capastrami.  We all ordered mediums, which were huge, and we were able to savor the leftovers for dinner.  The unfortunate thing was that the cole slaw and/or the Russian dressing were too sweet for me.  I'm sure some people will say otherwise, but to be safe, ask for them on the side.  There's a lot of both, which kinda makes the sandwich soggy.  Other than the overly sweet Capastrami, the other two were pretty tasty.  A definite second chance is on the horizon.

REVIEW #56:  3 stars  (443 chars)
Very little to enjoy at Capriottis, outside of the turkey that they roast themselves.  However, after doing so they shread the beast and pile modest amounts of it on indifferent rolls, add insipid stuffing and cloying-sweet cranberry sauce. ...  ... I don't expect that much out of a sub shop, and Capriottis is only a mild disappointment.  The only plus is value -- the sandwiches are large.  Get a 12-inch and share it.  You won't want more.

REVIEW #57:  3 stars  (495 chars)
We have some friend who were RAVING about this place, so we popped in for a sandwich before a movie recently.  I gotta say, I had a great reuben sandwich that I was VERY pleased with.  I'm not sure if I will be venturing to the area just to have this sandwich again, but it was super tasty.  Everyone seemed to like what they had and the menu has something for everyone.  If I'm in the area again, I might venture here, but I am partial to Jimmy John's (next door) so it might be hard to choose.

REVIEW #58:  3 stars  (440 chars)
We were lured to this sandwich shop by the giant banner out front declaring they have the BEST SANDWICHES IN AMERICA.  Quite a bold statement that we had to test out. I got the capastrami and she got the cheesesteak. ... Verdict: not the best sandwich in America. They forgot my order.... I had to ask about my sandwich 10 min after she got hers. Sandwich was good, but nothing to go out of my way for. ... I will probably not be returning.

REVIEW #59:  2 stars  (547 chars)
Chicken Cheese Steak with onions, pickles, peppers. Good flavor, but short on meat. Fresh soft roll, but it's a lot of bread when it's light on meat. Good news, it's something different than the neighbors (jj), Bad news was 10 minutes later my stomach did a flip from the grease and I spent my evening in the bathroom. ugh ... Expensive Sammiches then again we are in North Scottsdale! ... Will I try them again? Sure. I'd like to try the Bobbie nexttime around, though I'm not a chain-store fan. I'd rather find the mom & pop shop with real food.

REVIEW #60:  2 stars  (1110 chars)
I came here today because I was in the area, and figured it was time to try some Capriotti's. It was my first time eating their sandwiches, so I figured, what the heck, I'll give them a shot. ...  ... The menu has tons of options, and they have a few different sized subs, 9 inches being the smallest.  That's pretty darned big!  I went with a 9 inch Slaw Be Jo, and it came with meat, Russian dressing, coleslaw, mayo and roast beef.  The sandwich itself was okay, but I felt like it was missing something..it tasted kind of dry. I wanted to ask for more dressing, but after about getting half way through, I figured decided not to. I think the sandwich needs to come with some kind of dressing, prefereably Italian. It came across as somewhat dry. ...  ... Overall, prices were a okay.  $6.99 for the sandwich, $1.59 for drinks plus some tax, and the total was $9.35.  Not bad. I will say I wasn't impressed overall, but it wasn't the worst sandwich I had.  I feel like there's other sandwich shops in the area that serve similar but better sandwiches that might be worth trying before hitting up this place.

REVIEW #61:  2 stars  (295 chars)
I had the Bobbie. All the best sandwich in America bragging just made this mediocre sandwich seem that much worse. Dry turkey, rubbery bread. It wasn't so bad I didn't finish it, but I won't be coming back. If you can't get to an actual deli, then any other chain sandwich shops beat this place.

REVIEW #62:  2 stars  (2591 chars)
I've been to this place twice.  ... The first time was during a very busy lunchtime and the Tuna sandwich I had was pretty good.  It was a little hard to manuever around the tightly placed tables and chairs but that was about the only thing I had an issue with the first time.   ...  ... The second time I went with my daughter in the late afternoon when there was no-one else in the restaurant except a group of men who worked for Capriotti's who were having a business meeting at one of the tables.  When I ordered and paid for my meal I gave the cashier my money and watched as she LICKED HER INDEX FINGER and proceeded to take money out of the drawer and hand it to me as my change.  I was so disgusted and asked her "did you just lick your finger and then put use it to pull out the dollar that you just gave me"?  She shrugged and said "yeah".  I told her that it was gross and I didn't appreciate having her spit on the money that I was putting back into my wallet.  She just shrugged again.  Well I know money is dirty and all and who knows where the money has been that I already have in my wallet so oh wel...BUT THEN I watched her stick that SAME FINGER into the inside of my drink cup as she handed it to me.  I just looked at her and said" this is unbelievable".  I didn't bother saying anymore to her because I had a feeling she would just shrug again.  Well then I was really grossed out and just couldn't stomach filling my drink cup after she stuck her spitty finger in it so I was standing at the drink machine trying to decide what to do when one of the men from the meeting stood up and walked past me.  As he walked by I asked him if he worked there and he said "yes, do you need something"?  I said yes I need a new cup  because the cashier licked her finger to slide a  dollar bill out of the drawer then stuck that same finger inside my cup to hand it to me.  His reaction to this?  "ok, let me get you another cup.  Not "I'm sorry maam that is not the way we train our employees" or any other sort of apology or "I will discuss this with the employee and make sure it doesn't happen in the future"....nope he just handed me another cup and said "here you go".  Well I guess I could have pushed for an apology or something but I was just too disgusted to speak and decided that I just would never return to Capriotti's again.   ...  ... Just thought some of you out there would like to know what my experience was. ... I gave them two stars because the Tuna sandwich was actually pretty good, which is sad because I just can't bring myself to want to eat there again.

REVIEW #63:  2 stars  (402 chars)
Meat was very salty & was poor quality..was excited to try it but very disappointed.  I went with my wife and friend and we all love subs and have tried many and we all felt that it was ok!  The bread wasn't that great either..It seems like the other locations have better reviews but nonetheless, its still the same meats and bread.  I would rather go to Jimmy Johns, Jersey Mikes or Hangover Hoagies.

REVIEW #64:  2 stars  (365 chars)
Nothing like Capriotti's in other cities.  They don't have the same menu offerings as east coast locations, and even though I ate here when not busy it took a very long time for the food to arrive.  Parking is frustrating too because of the adjacent Starbucks patrons occupying so many spots.  Very poor chips selection as well - only two choices.  Really? 2 chips?

REVIEW #65:  2 stars  (417 chars)
Sandwiches are good but for the price it's not that good...3 subs and 3 drinks for over $30???? I think I will stick with subway...this place isn't that good and when you order a cheese steak sandwich why do you have to add the veggies they normally come with and pay extra???? The owner needs to get a clue!!! You aren't that good to charge these inflated prices...bring them down a bit and see your clientele grow!!

REVIEW #66:  2 stars  (989 chars)
Since I've been seeing signs claiming that Capriotti's was voted "the world's greatest sandwich" I decided to give it a try.  I decided to order an Italian sandwich.  First of all, I was a little sticker shocked...they don't have a combo meal so a medium sandwich, drink and chips came out to about $12.00--yowzers!  Secondly, I was the only customer for a good 10 minutes (it was 5pm on a Thursday) and my sandwich took FOREVER to get done.. maybe I'm use to Jimmy Johns and Subway.  I got mine to go and was very disappointed to find out when I got home that they gave me the WRONG sandwich.  How do you f-up an order when it's the only customer in the restaurant?  I even double checked my receipt to make sure I ordered the one I wanted.  Instead of an Italian I got some leftover Thanksgiving ensemble.  Well, this Yelper only eats stuffing on Thanksgiving and doesn't eat cranberry sauce or mayo at all.. I was so irate I gave the entire thing to my dog..hopefully he won't get sick.

REVIEW #67:  2 stars  (342 chars)
This was my 3rd visit to this location. The previous 2 visits were very satisfactory. This last time, however, you guys were really off your game. My ham sandwich on kaiser roll was half empty! Half the meat, no condiments to speak of(???) and the roll was turning stale. The manager(s) need to concentrate on re-training and quality control.

REVIEW #68:  1 stars  (1444 chars)
***AVOID THIS SANDWICH SHOP*** ...  ... First of all the main reason to not support this Capriottis is the poor management/ownership. If you care about being treated right as a customer, being valued for your business and overall being treated respectfully by a business... DO NOT GO HERE. ...  ... Here's my story... ... Capriotti's food in general as a chain sub shop can be very good. In fact I have ate there several times in the past, mostly from another location. But it is more expensive as some of the other posters have remarked. (So you'd like to get what you pay for correct? Certainly you can... BUT NOT HERE) ...  ... This location created a texting system for deals etc.. (I believe to drum up business when it's slow). They say in it "UPSIDE ANY SANDWICH to a 20: FOR THE PRICE OF A SMALL". I phone order, come in expecting to pay for a small and get ther large as advertised in their text. Not only did they NOT HONOR their own promotion. When the owner/manager got into it with me. He absolutely understood the confusion but WOULD NOT HONOR THE TEXT??? I asked him whether he'd rather lose return customers and have bad business in the future over his mistakes rather than rectify them on this one time basis. He had no interest in making things right. As I've read from other posters from a while back this ownership has no clue and hopefully we will all stand and let him know that businesses like this shouldn't be rewarded.

REVIEW #69:  1 stars  (1111 chars)
Did you know that Marky Mark is the same person as Mark Wahlberg? ...  ... And why did I mention this?  Because that is what the three workers (one I know was a manager) were debating about while I was waiting for my sandwich...and sandwich that was waiting to be handed to me.  Five minutes later....my name was called....another employee gave it to me...while the three guys were still talking about Marky Mark.   ...  ... I was told that I had to go to this "amazing sandwich"...the best sandwich in America.  Well...service wise...this place is awful.  The guy taking my order had severe ADD...(would you like a drink with that?  "No thank you"...ok would you like a regular or large drink?  Or!  "What is the total?"  Moron behind the counter..."The cookie is $1.29)  Food wise?  There was nothing...absolutely NOTHING about that sandwich (Chicken Cheesesteak)  that would make me forget about the bad counter service so I would go back.  The chicken was bland and extremely greasy.  I am still feeling the effects of the pit in my stomach of bottomless grease. ...  ... Sorry Caprioti's....not going back.

REVIEW #70:  1 stars  (896 chars)
I don't know who voted them the best sandwich shop in America, but I can guess that they... ... 1. Don't have taste buds ... 2. Have only ever had sandwiches from this place, nowhere else ... 3. Have endless amounts of money. ...  ... For two sandwiches and one drink, it cost me $15. Ridiculous. I wouldn't have been so annoyed had it been a good sandwich, but it was the worst sandwich I've ever had. The bread was comparable to cafeteria bread, the tuna salad was nothing but mayo and tuna, the lettuce tasted and looked old, the cheese was tasteless and stiff, and the tomato (read: a single slice of tomato) was sliced so thin that they might as well have not even bothered putting it on the sandwich. I'm actually quite surprised that I didn't get food poisoning. ...  ... My only advice is to head over to Whole Foods and spend a fraction of the cost on a much better and fresher sandwich.

REVIEW #71:  1 stars  (645 chars)
I had lunch ordered in for a business meeting 2 times.  The first time, about 3 weeks ago, the delivery was about 1 hour late, but the food was very, very good.  So I thougth to try again for another business meeting.  Again the delivery was late, but only by about 20 minutes, but this time the food was not so good.  The cheese steaks, both chicken and beef were totally lacking cheese onions and mushrooms.  And they completely left off the sweet peppers that were ordered.  And, they forgot one of the sandwiches.   The lack of organization, knowledge, and customer service when we called them was incredible.  I won't order from them again.

REVIEW #72:  1 stars  (706 chars)
I only write reviews on Yelp to help people save their money. ...  ... Ten bucks for a small sandwich and a drink.  "The Bobbie" which is supposed to be their signature sandwich is cold shredded turkey (maybe a 2 oz portion at most) cold stove top stuffing and cold cranberry sauce smushed in a rubbery piece of bread.  No sides!  If my co worker wasn't the one who picked this up and I was eating it inside the restaurant, I would march up to the counter and ask for a refund.   ...  ... My toddler could make this better in his sleep.   ...  ... Of all the years working in Scottsdale, this is hands down, the biggest ripoff for lunch.  How they are still in business after a year is beyond me.  GARBAGE.

REVIEW #73:  1 stars  (341 chars)
I ordered the homemade turkey sandwich and I got lettuce tomatoes cheese and pulled turkey thrown in shabbily between two slices of bread. The messiest and most unappealing looking sandwich I ever ate. Tasteless too. Don't even bother eating here. I'm sure Walmart, which is at a walking distance from this place, can make a better sandwich.

REVIEW #74:  1 stars  (577 chars)
My office moved to the area so I was driving around and saw the sign " Best Sandwich...." Um, no. If you want, I can come in there and show you how to cook a Chicken Cheese steak. First, don't wrap it up and let the sandwich sweat and make the bun soft and chewy. Second, put some meat on there. It was 50% bun.  It should be toasted and crunchy. And price, a 12" chicken cheese chips and drink was $13..are you kidding me. For that price, I was hoping for the best I ever had. Change it up Capriottis or the word will get out and it will all be over in this very tough market.

REVIEW #75:  1 stars  (402 chars)
Terrible first experience! I  ordered a sandwich for delivery to my work, I didnt have time to run out to grab something.  The sandwich was made completely wrong, i requested certain veggies/condiments and none were included but others i did not ask for were put on. I dont eat mayo, and the sandwich was drenched in mayo.  So this sandwich went straight into the trash.  I will never order from again.

REVIEW #76:  1 stars  (822 chars)
The sandwich was a 2 Star disappointment and when you combine the price this place really earns the lowest rating.  I ordered the Medium Philly with mushrooms and hots on the side along with a small drink- $13.50 what a rip off. (I didnt even get a side or chips what would that have been $15.+) These sandwiches don't even make the average persons top 100 so the sign sets you up for a big let down.  This business should do themselves a favor and remove this blatantly false advertising.  Even a fast food joint like Arbys and their $5.00 Philly is much better.  First time I've wanted to go back and tell them to their faces how below average they really are but its not the folks working hard behind the counters fault so Ill just leave it here.  Save your dime and try almost any other sammie for a better experience.

REVIEW #77:  1 stars  (1309 chars)
Wednesday, August 20th was a sad day for me.  The sandwich shop which I adored and the sub that I worshipped are no longer what they used to be.  Bought two cold italian combos  and took them home to hubby.  We were going to watch a special TV show and really enjoy ourselves with our sandwiches and beers.  Upon unraveling the sandwiches from the wrapper, we noticed that the cold cuts, formerly thinly sliced were thickly sliced-- so unappealing.  Being from the east coast, the mantra at the deli was always:  "Slice it thin".  The layers and layers of thin cold cuts and cheese made it so delectable.   I  also noticed that the cappicola was almost non-existent.  The lettuce was overdressed such that the bread was soaked wet  by the time I got home.  The tomatoes were like cardboard  so I threw them away (I hate throwing out food-it's unholy but I just couldn't eat them).  Hubby was so disgusted with the sandwich that he wouldn't eat it (neither would I for that matter) .  I ended up cooking and the next day I threw out the sandwiches which I had refrigerated in the hopes that they would somehow improve over time.   ... So here I am, knowing that I'll never have a Capriotti sandwich like the one they used to make and which had me looking forward to every bite. ... What happened Capriotti?????

Capriottis is awesome! They have a great menu that is a great value. I can get a Veggie burger that is delicious done the way I like in ten minutes and the price ...yes believe it its only $4.79. Honestly it is as good as veggie burgers elsewhere in town that are twice that price! If you are a vegetarian this is the lunch place for you you wont be disappointed!

REVIEW #2:  5 stars  (681 chars)
first off, these subs are packed with goodness. the guys that work there have been cool quick and collect. the place is comfortable to sit down to eat. sign up for their text msg club and receive some decent deals cause it is a bit steep at $8-9 for a 12", but you get worth from it regardless. they have a few salads n sandwiches but i stick to the subs. ...  ... THE BOBBIE is tops. thanksgiving anytime.  ... CAPASTRAMI is hella good. ... CHEESESTEAK is for real. ... GRILLED ITALIAN is delizioso. ... but, the SLAW-BE-JO is a bit too slaw-be for me. ...  ... i look forward to trying some other items at the risk of passing up a sub i already crave.. ...  ... so far, so great.

Great food. Enough variety to make eating here regularly interesting.

REVIEW #5:  5 stars  (789 chars)
Great sandwiches and the spectacular Bobbie eating at Capriotti's is a must! Beautiful baguettes stuffed with fresh meats and toppings what's not to love? Oh and they make it interesting if you text "Caps104" to 25328 by sending you yummy little deals. Cheese-steaks beef or chicken and The Bobbie are my go to sandwiches. I have no doubt the other options are delicious and someday soon I will try something else.  I am very happy to see this brand new Capriotti's in Old Town Scottsdale, and once you have eaten there you will be happy too! Oh yeah this is a combo location; Everything Bagel's is in the same location and they serving homemade bagels and noshes, they are open at 6am M-F and 7am on Sat & Sun so breakfast can be had if you get there too early for a Capriotti's sandwich.

REVIEW #8:  5 stars  (379 chars)
I can't express how happy I am that Capriotties has made it to Scottsdale. I'm totally addicted to this Vegas based sandwich chain, and if there is an opportunity to get the Bobbie outside of Las Vegas, I'm jumping on it. Please go in and try the Bobbie...if the cranberry sauce makes you second guess ordering it, you can always ask for it without cranberry, it's still awesome!

REVIEW #9:  5 stars  (221 chars)
I grew up in New York and Philadelphia. This place place has some of the best subs I've had. Not just in AZ but anywhere. Everyone who works at the Scottsdale location is very courteous and love going here. 5 star shop!!!

REVIEW #10:  5 stars  (201 chars)
I have enjoyed many sandwich shoppes   across Arizona over my 25 years hear, but this is one of the best. The freshness of the turkey and the vegetables on top of daily fresh baked bread is incredible.

REVIEW #11:  5 stars  (242 chars)
I LURVE the capastrami sandwich. It literally melts in your mouth. The chopped Italian salad and roast beef bleu cheese salad were also stellar. But that capastrami sandwich is still on my mind. Fantastic. I am drawn to it like moth to flame.

REVIEW #12:  5 stars  (684 chars)
I was sad to see Schlotzky's go away, but I went in to the new place last night with a few friends before going out to the casino. I was hungry, but didn't want to get stuffed, so I went with the small (9 inch) cheese steak sandwich. It had thinly sliced steak with cheese, mixed peppers, onions and mayo. Oh, man! It was delicious, I ate the whole thing in about two minutes. The veggies were great, and the bread was delicious and able to hold everything together without getting too messy. One of the employees let us know that they are open late (3 am) and will have a liquor license by the end of summer. Great news! I will definitely be back for a medium or large sandwich soon.

REVIEW #13:  5 stars  (633 chars)
I'm not the biggest sandwich fan, but Capriottis has defnitely opened my eyes to the BEST sandwiches I have ever had at a sandwich shop. The first time I ever tried it was in Las Vegas, so I am happy to see that Capriottis is spreading across the states. I originally got hooked on "The Bobbie," which is Thanksgiving dinner in a roll of bread. At my most recent visit, however, I decided to venture out from my original fav and got the "Slaw-be-Joe." I was not disappointed! It was filled with tender roast beef, provolone cheese, coleslaw, and a mayo dressing. Capriottis beats all the other sandwich shops out there... hands down!

REVIEW #14:  5 stars  (956 chars)
I've already reviewed the location on Mill Ave in Tempe, however I recently moved and this location is supa close to my house.  ...  ... I love Capriotti's and was so excited that a new location opened up in Old Town a few months ago. The service is always friendly, and everyone seems happy to be there!  ...  ... I've tried every one of the vegetarian selections. My favorite has to be the Veggie Turkey Cole. So, so delicious. Coleslaw and Russian dressing (which I must say is the only time I've had this kind of dressing)? SOLD. The prices are a little more expensive than other chain sub places, however a small is a whopping 9 inches. It's definitely enough to fill you up. The ingredients always taste fresh.  ...  ... I also like how this is connected to an Everything Bagels, although I have yet to try them.  ...  ... As with my last review, I really wish they would get a veggie version of The Bobbie already! Who do I have to talk to for this?

REVIEW #15:  5 stars  (359 chars)
If you want a very filling and enjoyable sandwich for a great price, try out Capriottis.  The first sandwich I ever tried was a Bobby, which is Thanksgiving in a sandwich.  It was very tasty and filling that I was full after half a sandwich.  You get a mix of turkey, gravy, stuffing, and more goodies.  There are other great hot sandwiches available as well.

My wife and her law firm have been eating at the FLW/101 location for quite awhile now and she has been raving about it! I discovered there was this location down the street from my office and have been eating here just about every other day for lunch! Last week our office placed an order for a meeting! The sandwhiches taste the same every time!!! ...  ... I have ordered the Italian, Turkey and the Bobbie! I usually change things up on my order and not once have i had a bad sandwhich or gotten back to my office with anything but what I ordered.  ...  ... Warren is a top notch owner and was actually the person who took my order on todays visit. It is nice to see an owner that is hands on with his company!! You do not come across that very often and when you do, they usually aren't running the register.  ...  ... I will keep eating here and I will recommend this place to anyone that is looking for a good sub, especially if you like turkey!!

REVIEW #17:  5 stars  (242 chars)
Ok. So I am in the restaurant bizz. I own a Pizza store. I have been craving a good Italian Sub.  OMG!!  I will probably be back here tomorrow. ABSOLUTLEY amazing. Great staff. Great service. Anyone who likes a good Sammie has got to go here!

REVIEW #18:  5 stars  (284 chars)
Our Company gets sandwiches once  a week from this place. They are hands down , one of the best cheese steak sandwiches with "real steak". They load it up, and ingredients are always fresh. Don't end up at subway, quiznos, or any other crappy place in the area. End up here for lunch!

REVIEW #19:  5 stars  (281 chars)
The subs here are delicious! I got the firecracker turkey with mayo and regular mustard and it was heaven. Also got a brownie. Sooo good. I don't normally eat subs but this was not your typical sub. Most people like subway and I cannot stand them. Also, employees were all so nice.

REVIEW #20:  5 stars  (364 chars)
These guys are legends in my book. Mike made my sandwich exactly the way I asked and was there with Mikey to greet us at the door. Mikey did a really great job explaining the menu and really made me feel like a part of the family. Mike and Mikey are incredible individuals who did a fantastic job of making us feel welcome and making sure that we had a great time!

REVIEW #21:  5 stars  (793 chars)
These guys know how to make a real sub sandwich! Never heard of them until last week, one of my friends brought it up as a lunch idea for after our hike up Camelback. So glad we went! Every component in the sandwich was high quality and just delicious. I had the 9" Italian with everything, plus crushed peppers for a little kick. I only put it down a couple times to clean my face off a little. The bread was delicious; nice and crispy on the outside, light and fluffy on the inside and the ingredients were piled high, just like I like it! With a Subway sandwich you get 70% bread and a little meat, which gets buried under the add-ons. Had no problem finding the meat and cheeses in this one; made up probably 40% of the whole sub! Definitely going to come back for more, whenever possible!

REVIEW #22:  5 stars  (496 chars)
Those that are my Yelp friends know my addiction to Caps by my check-ins via the Yelp App.  LOL   ...  ... Haven't tried any other sandwich but the cheese steak.  Why?  Cause the cheese steak is that awesome!  Get it with hot pepper, sweet pepper, and mushrooms ($1 extra for shrooms) - you wont be sorry!!  :) ...  ... If you haven't signed up for the Caps104 text (Text CAPS104 to 25328), and you are a patron of Caps, well then I shake my head at you!  You're missing out on tasty offers!!  :)

REVIEW #23:  4 stars  (919 chars)
A place that puts turkey, cranberry sauce and dressing (stuffing for non-southerners) on a crusty bun deserves a 4 star or better rating.   Geesus people that's an insane sandwich.   ...  ... I had lunch here recently with Rand H, Mike C and Robyn B.  Met Jackie C for the1st time.    ...  ... For lunch,  I stuck with the "more of the middle road" and ordered the Capistrami... Hot pastrami, Swiss cheese, Russian Dressing, and coleslaw.  But instead of having mine on a toasty bun, I had mine with a bit of lettuce in a bowl.  A fantastic bunless sandwich and since this particular sammie is quite the messy one, I'm happy I could eat this one with a fork. ...  ... For those who love sandwiches, their's come in 9, 12 and 15 in bun sizes.  Uhm yeah... BIG, HUGE and Gigantic.   ...  ... I'll definitely return to this place.  I may work up the courage to try the Bobbie, but until then, I'm fine with the Capistrami!

REVIEW #24:  4 stars  (495 chars)
Capriotti's seriously has THE BEST sandwiches I have ever tasted! I always switch off between "The Bobbie" and the "Cole Turkey." Both are fantastic! This particular location loads on the ingredients too, so I never feel like I'm getting jipped. The ingredients are always fresh and the sandwiches are huge! Their smalls are about the same size as a large at most sandwich chains. They also use shredded turkey instead of sliced which seemed odd to me at first, but it actually tastes very good!

REVIEW #25:  4 stars  (452 chars)
Got together with Ursula D., Jackie C., Mike C., & Robyn N. today to give this Capriotti's a try.  I had only been once, to the one over on 16th St. in Phoenix, and I loved both that restaurant and the "Capastrami" sandwich there, a lot. ...  ... I found this restaurant a little less appealing, and didn't care as much for the hot "Bobbie" Sub, but with that said it was still very good & I'm likely to return!     :-)) ...  ... 12" Bobbie Sub:  $8.39

REVIEW #26:  4 stars  (189 chars)
Hard to believe places like Subway exist when Capriottis is in town. They got it right from the toppings to the most important part- their amazing bread. Don't miss getting a sandwich here.

REVIEW #27:  4 stars  (258 chars)
I love Capriotti's. It really is the best sub chain around! ...  ... I like how you can taste the good quality, distinctive flavors of each ingerdient.   ... You can taste bread, and meat and cheese unlike say, Subway, where everything is just Subway flavor.

REVIEW #28:  4 stars  (205 chars)
I stopped her on the way home from work this weekend.  The sandwiches are interesting.  The one I had was called the Bobi, it was literally like Thanksgiving on a bun.  Food was pretty good. Good location.

REVIEW #29:  4 stars  (1459 chars)
I would give this place 5 stars but a member if staff is just so rude he forced me to rank a star lower.  ... The good : I go here after work most days and am a regular. I always get the vegetarian cheesesteak and a vegetarian turkey. They're always fantastic and I'd recommend it to anyone. The staff at night is great, friendly, funny, and they're all around nice workers . Theyre always experimenting or trying to give suggestions for my sandwiches to change it up. The night staff gets 5 stars. ...  ... The bad: the first time I went there there was a business woman in front of me ordering, and whom I assume is the manager or owner. (Older man, larger ) was having a ball chatting up and being super friendly. However when it was my turn in line I was greeted with a snobby toned. 'Hello can I help you?' I was very upset by this. I have trouble in social settings , so his 'I don't want to deal with you tone' definitely ruined my mood . One more encounter with him was during a morning time when we ordered a bagel sandwich (which stops being served after 11 as he so rudely stated). We had ordered one about 40 min prior but in the midst of a crowd they forgot to charge us. Once we got home we hopped in our car to go pay. He acted as if we were some punks. All we were trying to do was be honest and pay what they forgot to charge. He needs to work on his people skills.  ...  ... Other than that, I like the food and staff! (Most of them anyways)

I've been to Caps 2 times since they've opened.  Still a little sad that Schlotzskys is no longer.  Anyhow...A little pricey for a sandwich, but its a tasty sandwich.  And their small is 9inches, not like your subway 6inches.   ...  ... Text "Caps104" to 25328 and you'll receive deals/discounts.  Just last week, I received a text stating it was buy an medium and receive a large sandwich.  Unfortunately, I already had lunch plans or else I would have asked one of my colleagues if they wanted to split a cheese steak.  :)

It's great to have another option until 3am on the weekends, especially on the south side of Indian School rd. I have been a fan since they opened the location in North Scottsdale. Oddly enough this location also has a bagel shop...

REVIEW #33:  4 stars  (322 chars)
My fiance and I are from the east coast and so we have been trying to find somewhere to fill the void of Wawa and the Amorosa's rolls and Capriottis does just this.  He likes the Bobbie (leftover Thanksgiving in a sandwich) and I am in love with the Capastrami.  Deliciousness.  The text message deals don't hurt either :)

REVIEW #34:  4 stars  (425 chars)
My mouth salivates every time I think of their pastrami sandwich! Call me a fatty but I don't care. I would eat one everyday if I could! The Russian sauce complemented the already flavorful pastrami & made the sandwich stand out from other pastrami sandwiches I've had. I would definitely come back to this place because the sandwiches are reasonably priced & the service was fast. I can't wait to try their other sandwiches!

REVIEW #35:  4 stars  (387 chars)
OK - I'm jumping them up to four stars because I stopped in this morning and not only did they have salt bagels, the guy told me that he had hired a new baker and that means he won't have to be there seven days a week anymore. I'm hoping that this means that they will have salt bagels everyday from now on. ...  ... Also, the new baker did a great job and my salt bagels tasted great!!!

Pickles, Pickles Pickles ! It was only after my 3rd visit that I got  pickle chips on a sandwich and I have to say they were the best Pickle I have yet to try in al my nearly 5 decades here on earth!  ...  ... The Sandwich I had yesterday was weird though tasty, I kinda thought they made a mistake and gave me tuna. It was THE TURKEY,The Turkey meat was in shreds and very wet, that with the pickles, peppers, mustard, mayo and vegies It was a conundrum. ...  ... I wanted the same sandwich I had a few days prior but I didn't recognize it on the menu, I now know it was THE ITALIAN. This sandwich is so fresh with great meats and fresh toppings it was a winner and I was both Happy and Sad I had to share it with a hungry coworker. ...  ... My first impression last week on my first visit, I had the CAPISTRAMI, It was highly recommended by the cashier and although I have never wanted ordered a Ruben, I must say the sandwich was a solid 9 out of 10. ...  ... I love the location of this new Capriotties, It's a very welcome addition of fast casual restaurants that scatter the area I work in. Americas Taco Shop, Qudoba, Paradise Bakery are weak options and I almost would rather go hungry. That problem is solved with Capriotties now in the hood. ...  ... What needs work are the side options, as of now only chips, I hope they work on that!  ...  ... What doesn't need work is the sandwiches and Ultra helpful, professional, and extra friendly staff. ...  ... Welcome to Old Town CAPRIOTTIES!!!!! Keep up The Great work!!!!!

First time ever at a Capriottis. I had read how good the sandwiches are. I went in and it looked promising.  Excellent location. Great interior: TV's, a chronology of the history of  Capriottis, nicely arranged.  Lots of choices on the board. I ordered a Veggie Cole Turkey, vegetarian turkey with cole slaw. I asked Davianna if the sandwich included onions and she said no. I received my sandwich, nicely wrapped and taped.  Went back to my vehicle and dug in. To my disappointment, not only was the sandwich not vegan turkey, there was no cole slaw and plenty of onions. So I returned and explained, with my receipt, that the order was wrong. To their credit, they apologized, offered me a free upgrade and made me what I wanted originally. ...  ... After the frustration of feeling that they just didn't pay attention when I ordered, I tried the sandwich and it was excellent.  Cole slaw was perfect and the vegan turkey was tasty.  And no onions this time. :) ...  ... Without the trouble, I probably would have given it a 4+.  I will definitely try this franchise again.

I have never been to a Capriottis before... ... This one is brand new and obviously still working out a few kinks. I decided to go with the Cole Turkey. I ordered a medium, which was a mistake. It was HUGE. I ate that sandwich for two days, next time I'm going with the small size for sure.  ... I had heard that they cook their turkey fresh and they absolutely do. I took a bite of my sandwich and it was real turkey meat, I even got a small bone in one of the first few bites. ... The coleslaw is a bit flavorless, but OK. I do not think I would order this sandwich again, but i will be back to try their cheesesteak.  ...  ... They deliver within a two mile radius... ...  ... It's A-OK.

Semi-Disappointed.  I went here after hearing so much about "The Bobbie."  I got this legendary sandwich and it just wasn't so legendary.   ... Stuffing, cranberry sauce, and turkey!? Thanksgiving in your mouth right?  ehhh..well the mayo was so overpowering and it was served cold.  Both kinda threw me off.  Of course I can't rank a place on one sandwich and will have to return for more. ...  ... I mean hey...they are probably the first shop that lists a 12 inch sub on the menu that is actually 12 inches! (huge!)

We went by this place and saw a sign that said "Voted America's Best Sandwich" and thought we should check it out.  So here is the good news first: The customer service in this place is AWESOME!  The staff is very knowledgeable about the food and can make recommendations on the spot.  The owner was so friendly and happy to talk to us since it was our first time in the shop.  He joked with us at the end of our meal also when we asked to take the rest home.  A fairly young and hip team who seemed very excited to hand you your order which I found refreshing since I am usually a Subway person.  Now for the not so good news:  We tried the Capastrami sandwich after reading what sounded like an awesome description on the menu board.  Now I like a great pastrami with coleslaw and some sort of dressing, but this thing was SATURATED in mayo.  Between the overly dressed coleslaw and the Russian dressing, it was just too over powering for what was actually really good pastrami.  The bread was really good, so it was sad to have such a drenched sandwich.  Next time I will take the advice of the owner and try their famous "Bobbie Sub" which looks like Thanksgiving dinner on a sub.

REVIEW #42:  2 stars  (448 chars)
Decent sandwiches, but what I really like is the fact that they are tied in with Everything Bagel's.  ...  ... However, why is Everything Bagel's always out of salt bagels? Seriously., I stop there at 7:55 in the morning and they're already out of salt bagels? A couple of times they said they didn't even make them that day. ...  ... One request, if you say you make Salt bagels and you have a bin marked Salt Bagels, MAKE SOME DAMN SALT BAGELS!!!

Had the turkey on wheat bread. Bread was great, where's the shredded turkey? I probably had 3 tablespoons total on my full sandwich. I'll stick with Jimmy Johns everyday of the week.

REVIEW #44:  2 stars  (2412 chars)
I know I'm going to get crap for this but, oh well here goes... ... Starving, I go out into the vicious sauna that is Scottsdale in monsoon season, seeking food on a Sunday afternoon. After a couple of "closed on Sunday" disappointments, I decided to go slumming at the always-disappointing Schlotskys Deli on Scottsdale. Lo and behold, shiny new Capriottis and Everything Bagel swooped in to save the neighborhood.  Yay... No wait, hold my calls, I'm not done. I walk in and the place is about 85* in the restaurant... Yuck. I walk up to the register to order and asked the very pregnant sweating girl how long ago did they take over Schlotskys.  She rolled her eyes, looked down, and said "2 months, what would you like to order?"  I ordered. Then she asked for my name to tag my order.  I told her my name.  Another giant eye roll and a (fuck it, who cares) shrug. She says "I can't spell".  Because I don't normally care whether my name is spelled or pronounced correctly, even though, on this very rare occasion, I had pronounced it phonetically for her, I just blew it off. But then, right on the cash register screen facing me, was her spelling... "corney".  I laughed. She scoffed... "What?" She says. "I'm just laughing at how you spelled my name." Then she smirks and says "it works." And walked away without even looking at me. OK, kinda snotty. ... I walk down to where the food comes out, and the young dude making my sandwich is also sweating (no kidding)  and wiping the sweat off with the back of his wrist.  Whatever... it's Scottsdale. ... The other kid working was on his lunch break. I could tell that by how he blew past me full speed, across the store, clumsily juggling a plastic cup and skidded 3 feet to a stop in front of an available table to eat at, and plopped his ass down. I hope he chose something caffeine free.  ... Look, I know they're young, I know it's hot here, I know other guy is a spaz, I know she's pregnant, I can even surmise that she may not like her job, life, self... None of those things negate the fact that you (said employees) went out and got yourself a job in the food service industry... Serving others, food. Part of service is being polite. Another part is being professional. Where the f are the adults to corral these youngsters and teach them how to represent your business? Shame on you.  ... Oh, the sandwich was fantastic! Thank you, sweaty tall kid.

I was highly disappointed in my visit to Capriotti's this time.  I have been here before and thought it was great.  Today I decided to take an out of state collegue here after I spoke highly of the place.  We got there, and not too many people were there, so we got there just in time.  We ordered our sandwiches. Hers pretty much came out right away, while mine still didn't arrive after 10-15 minutes. I noticed the people that came in after us getting their food.  I decided to check at the counter and make sure they didn't lose my order.  I was told, no, they had a large phone order that came in right before I ordered.  I wasn't sure how this could be accurate considering those after me already received their orders. After 7 more minutes passed my food finally appears and I was told "ooops, they did lose your order".  I open it and the sandwich was obviously thrown together.  it had tomatoes on it, that I specifically requested not to have.  It did not have the mayo and pickles I requested and it was very dry (due to no condiments).  I was embarrassed that I bragged about capriotti's and my guest and I experienced this.  We were also late coming back from lunch because of this ordeal.

REVIEW #46:  2 stars  (112 chars)
I've tried two sandwiches here, both were dry.  That said, I would choose Capriottis over Subway 6 our 10 times.

REVIEW #47:  2 stars  (495 chars)
Okay, so I've now eaten here three times, and have tried two different Sandwiches. I can honestly say that It's generic and bland. Their Cheesesteak needs something to season it, even with hot peppers and onions, its still dull. The Tuna was too fishy tasting, almost like they didn't do anything special with it. Their cookies are dull. This place needs work, I'm not sure how they won best sandwich shop. Avoid this place unless you want to pay too much for food an amateur could make at home.

REVIEW #48:  2 stars  (836 chars)
Sandwich was meh. The turkey was unlike any other turkey I'd ever had had on a sandwich. It was as if you took a week old left over DRY thanksgiving turkey and shredded it up and stuffed it on a roll. It was a combo of white and dark meat as well as the bones (I had three bones in my small size sandwich). The chopped hot peppers were good though and by far the best part of the sandwich. Also, the guy ringing up my order was texting during the ring up process. Lastly, my sandwich was given to someone else, she opened it and returned it to the counter. The worker just rewrapped it then called my name and gave it to me. I was in somewhat of a hurry so didn't want to ask them to remake it but still didn't seem very professional. Maybe I would go back and try something different but doubt it. My first experience just wasn't good.

REVIEW #49:  2 stars  (726 chars)
The four star rating made the difference for me as I tried to decide which of various eateries on the same corner to select for a quick lunch after a meeting in Old Town Scottsdale. Although it was lunch hour, the shop wasn't crowded, so I had high expectations of the food and service. Unfortunately, my order was misplaced, so it took over 20 minutes to get a turkey and tomato sandwich. More importantly, when I received it, it gave the appearance of something hastily thrown together - where's the love? As I waited, the place got busier, so they clearly have a good following and I'll give them a second try sometime - but not soon. There are a lot of choices in Old Town, and service is King - here it was a mere pauper.

REVIEW #50:  2 stars  (332 chars)
There are lots of good options for subs in Scottsdale but this isn't one of them. It has so clear die Hard fans and I read all these great reviews and was eager to try this place. Sadly it does not live up to its reputation. Very little meat on the subs and not great cuts of meat. I would equate the quality of Caprottis to Subway.

REVIEW #51:  1 stars  (933 chars)
Absolutely ridiculous. I ordered 40$ worth of food from this location to have delivered. It comes almost 2 hours later. The lady comes in drops it on my desk and walks out. I ordered a medium cheese steak and a small, plus some other side items. I opened my sandwiches and they gave me 2 veggie sandwiches . I call the store that delivered and I was told that they weren't the store that delivered . It must have been the one on Frank Lloyd Wright and the 101. That's ridiculous. I am less then a mile away from the Old Town location. The Old Town Capriottis manager was rude and no help at all. I called the other Capriottis and they apologized and said that they didn't take that order. But they will send out the food for us anyways. But guess what? They never showed up. I will not bring returning as a customer. This is unacceptable and the customer service is terrible . This place probably won't exist in 5 years at this rate.

REVIEW #52:  1 stars  (748 chars)
I placed an online order to be delivered to our office for a lunch meeting. First they arrived over an hour late. When we called to follow up on the food the person answering the phones was not apologetic and bordering on rude.  When the food finally arrived the order was wrong. They brought a chef salad instead of garden and the person who ordered it is a vegetation so she had to go without lunch. They also brought an extra meatball sub, not sure who that was supposed to be for but I guess that means they had at least two angry customers that day. I honestly feel filling food orders is the easiest job in the world, just double check the bag before it leaves, there's no excuse for this type of mistake. I won't be ordering from them again.

REVIEW #53:  1 stars  (334 chars)
The sandwiches are pretty good but the morons that run this place make it the process of getting a sandwich unbearable.  I called to place a pickup order at 8:40 and the lazy kid on the phone said no more orders cause they were closing. This place needs a manager to come in and clean out the current staff. I'LL NEVER GO THERE AGAIN!

Best sandwiches in Vegas period. Stay away if your trying to eat healthy but when I cheat which is once in a while this is one of the places I go to. The Bobbi is famous for a reason. Probably one of the best sandwiches I ever had. Been to Philly so I know what a good authentic cheese steak taste like. When I first moved out here I tried a lot of places but none came close. Capriottis is the closest that I've found. Very good and they give you a lot of meat.

REVIEW #2:  5 stars  (643 chars)
Capriotti's is the best place around for delicious sandwiches!  I just had the capastrami and it was incredible.  The pastrami was nice and lean (well, as lean as pastrami gets) and they piled it high on a great roll with lots of crunchy slaw and a tasty russian dressing.  But the kicker is to ask for some of the hot pepper relish on the side.  Try it on the sandwich and you'll never look back.  Amazing! ...  ... The Bobbie is also really good and so is the plain old turkey sandwich (I got it on the kaiser roll). ...  ... I like this location because it's never too too crowded and the service is always fast and friendly.  Check it out!

Hands down the best sandwich shop in town. Their signature sandwiches such as the Bobbie and Capastrami are second to none. If your ever in the mood for a sandwich, skip Subway and Quizno's and head to your local Capriotti's Sandwich shop! ...  ... **NOTE** ...  ... -Make sure to tip these guys out as they are all very appreciative for the beer money. :)

REVIEW #6:  5 stars  (1276 chars)
If there is one thing I know to be true, it's that the Pizza and sandwiches are simply a thousand times better on the East coast. This is why Cap's deserves the 5 star rating. They bring the good stuff West.  ... Living in Delaware, we were spoiled by many great sandwich shops, and Cap's is an all time Delaware classic. Great sandwiches need great bread, and Cap's delivers. They don't skimp on the meat and veggies, either. Everyone needs to try the Capostrami at least once. The bobby, (thanksgiving on a roll) isn't my thing, but it may well be yours. It's very popular at home, and here in Vegas.  ...  ... Cap's in Vegas takes the exact same approach as back home. It's a no frills, bare bones sandwich shop, East coast style. the menu isn't extensive, but everything is delicious. The best cheese steak in town.  ...  ... My personal favorite is the turkey sub. Cap's turkey is almost like pulled or shredded turkey, not sheets of deli turkey. It's juicy and delicious, and I highly reccomend the red pepper spread with it.  ...  ... Let's face it. While Vegas has lots of amazing food, when it comes to Pizza and sandwiches, the duds are a dime a dozen. Cap's is a diamond in the rough, serving up tried and true sandwiches for a great price. East coast approved. ; )

REVIEW #7:  5 stars  (587 chars)
If you've never heard of the bobbie, which I might consider capriotti's signature sandwich, it's basically thanksgiving between two pieces of bread...with lots of mayo. ...  ... In the mayo slathered bun we have real turkey (not the lunch meat BS), cranberry sauce, and stuffing. It tastes as good as it sounds and you can't tell if the turkey is dry or not because of all that mayo. She is a hearty and carby sandwich so it might be best to bobbie it up in moderation but you would be remiss to skip out on the tastes of a holiday, whenever, wherever, and in ergonomic cylindrical form.

REVIEW #8:  5 stars  (133 chars)
Just had the Capistrami with no Russian Dressing and it was delicious. If you like spicy, add the hot pepper relish for extra flavor!

REVIEW #9:  5 stars  (2870 chars)
Once in a while we have a hankering for a good Sub; there's nothing like biting into a fluffy, soft, chewy roll upon which your mouth hits payload with a good, thick, hearty deli meat mixed with the crunch of vegetables....it's a mush of satisfying flavors swirling around that's instantly gratifying....(of which we're devout followers...) ...  ... Capriotti's is a bit of that East Coast shop, reminiscent of your favorite local neighborhood deli.  A sense of nostalgia sweeps over you upon entering the doors; the black and white checker tiled floors, kids in white aprons running between chaos and order; from the front counter where you order to the back counter with the flat top griddle where all the magic happens, it's a quintessential universal memory.....an American Classic. ...  ... Capriotti's has been on several, 'Best Sub Sandwich' lists, with 'The Bobbie' being it's most popular, (it's even made it into Urban Dictionary)....It's definitely earned it's recognition and is worth trying out for yourselves!!! ...  ... And can I say, there's something about getting that sandwich over the counter, wrapped in it's white butcher paper, thick and weighty like handling a mighty sword; a sense of power  rushes over you as you toss your meaty sandwich up in the air like a baton.....it's like.....Deli Power!!!!! ...  ... We have two favorite sandwiches that we always get, (by now if you've read our post, you know that once we like something, that's pretty much all we're gonna get..).  Adventurous? Nope. Consistent? Yes.. ...  ... The Capastrami: hot Pastrami sandwich with Swiss, Russian Salad Dressing and the Cole Slaw is fantastic; it's that blend of piping hot pastrami, with the creamy, crunch of tangy Cole Slaw and Russian Dressing that is just indescribably delicious!!!!  ...  ... I love the entire process of eating a Capriotti's Sub; unwrapping the white butcher paper and rolling the sandwich out, with big, aromatic wafts filling your senses, it make you ravenous for all that is between the hoagie roll! ... This sandwich does not last long on the plate, you find yourself devouring it within seconds!  It is hands down, one of the Best Subs Sandwiches I have ever had... ...  ... The other sandwich, of course, is The Bobbie: Home made roasted Turkey with Cranberry Sauce, Stuffing, Provolone and Mayo.  It's exactly the sandwich that all you guys make the day after Thanksgiving!!! ...  ... Now we like the Bobbie hot, (I know I know, it's supposed to be cold- but we like the stuffing and turkey warm for some reason).  Cold stuffing isn't appealing...... ...  ... But it's truly a comfort food dish, and the Turkey is excellent, especially since it's home made!! You must try this place, it will satisfy your Sub craving!! ...  ... Rating (Out of Five Stars) ...  ... Food:            4.75 ... Ambience:    3.5 ... Service:        4.5

REVIEW #10:  5 stars  (1155 chars)
Pre-text: My husband and I had never been up this far in Henderson. The only reason we were up here was because we had been hiking at Sloan Canyon and we were both very hungry after our hike. Yay for Cap's! ...  ... This Cap's is located in a shopping mall in a very Western part of Henderson, nestled among golf courses, country clubs, and from what I could tell, rather expensive housing. It's a nice area. The Cap's is nice too, clean, with a long wooden counter and a bar to eat at.  ...  ... The gentlemen working were very nice, clever individuals who continually yelled, "Hey, we got beer money!" whenever anyone tipped them. So, of course, I tipped them too. Good tactic. ...  ... As for the food, I ordered a medium Capastrami, which I looooove. The meat is so tender, absolutely amazing flavor. This is the way it is at all the Cap's in town. But this one may have been a tad better because I had just been on a hike. My husband got his go-to The Bobbie.  ...  ... We got some drinks and a bag of chips and ate outside on one of their two tables and then we both ate the rest of our sandwiches at home for dinner! Ha! Thanks for two meals Cap's!

REVIEW #11:  5 stars  (588 chars)
Talk about GREAT sandwiches!!! The Capastrami is the BEST!!! This place is always voted Best Of Vegas every year for a good reason!! The food RULES!! The bread and meats are always fresh and delicious! Over 10 years of enjoying sandwiches at Capriottis and I have never been disappointed!! The staff is always friendly and efficient. I now live in California, but Capriottis is the first place I hit when I pull into town. I always pick it up BEFORE I get to my destination!  ...  ... FYI - They have a Elvis impersonator who makes the experience extra enjoyable (especially for Laura!!!)

Great sandwich shop.  Get the Bobbi.  They actually roast entire turkey's overnight and carve it for the sandwich.  Add the sweet cranberry sauce with stuffing and it's an amazing turkey sandwich.  It's Thanksgiving in a sandwich everyday.

REVIEW #16:  4 stars  (1479 chars)
I decided to have a treat day and since it's been a while I've had Capriotti's, it was the obvious choice (oh, and it's right next to my dry cleaners). I ordered the Grilled Italian for myself and the Capistrami for the fianc (his favorite). The service was fabulous (I got a good laugh out of them cheering about "beer money" when I tipped) and of course, it smelled delicious in there. Oh, and they carry treats from Nothing Bundt Cakes in their fridge (next to the bottled beverages)! Ahh, I almost gave in too. ...  ... I wish I could have eaten the sandwich fresh that afternoon, but I had to drive them all the way home (30 minutes) and the bread was a tad soggy from the moisture and the sandwich contents. That did not take away from the tantalizing smell I had to endure for the whole trip and the deliciousness when I finally got to dig in (yeah, it didn't even make it to the table). OMGOODNESS, soo good! Party in my mouth. I hardly order hot sandwiches and I was a little skeptical about the Grilled Italian, but it was amazing. Next time I'll opt for the hot peppers along with the sweet peppers because I think it needs that spice. I also tried a few bites of the Capistrami (I've had it before) and oh, DROOL. Their meat is great. ...  ... I can't wait for my next trip here to try another sandwich. Oh, and obviously, the Bobbie is one of the greatest sandwiches that ever lived. Eat it. Even if you don't like cranberry sauce or Thanksgiving dinners. That good.

REVIEW #17:  4 stars  (665 chars)
I'd heard about Capriotti's and wanted to try it, so I went to grab some sandwiches for myself and my family the other day. I was really impressed from the moment I walked in. The staff were all really friendly and helpful. I ordered two 12" subs - the capistrami and a turkey sub. Both were great, but what really impressed me was that the turkey was roasted fresh in the store. I could see the kitchen from the counter area and there was a whole roasted turkey in a roasting pan waiting to be cut up for their sandwiches. You don't see that at many sub shops! All the toppings tasted really fresh and the bread was great, too. I'd definitely go back another time!

REVIEW #18:  4 stars  (460 chars)
Really tasty subs: as first timers, we stuck with the capastrami and the bobbie, the 2 most yelped about.  ...  ... 2 Mediums (at 12" each) ended up to be about 7" too long for the 4 of us lightweights!  (Then again, we were kind of pacing ourselves for our impending M-fest later in the day.) ...  ... The capastrami was everyone's fave but I thought the bobbie was right up there. the turkey was really moist and delicious. a perfect one handed thanksgiving.

REVIEW #19:  4 stars  (318 chars)
Sandwiches are pretty good for the prices. They are freshly made and you can always call ahead if you're in the hurry. Most of the cooks are young guys and they are fun to talk to. I like their cole turkey sandwich and cheese steaks. The food is delicious and you can get your sandwich made which ever way you want to.

The Bobbie is the most delicious sandwich in the world.   The staff is usually pretty friendly but at times they can be a bit slow.  During the summer this shop can get uncomfortably warm.

This place is a chain? How did I not eat here all this time? Excellent sandwich shop that needs to expand like everywhere! The sandwiches here are the complete opposite of Subway, unhealthy and delicious. We ordered 3 sandwiches for my attending physician and his employees and I offered to carry them out. He insisted that I don't but I did anway. And boy those babies were heavy! I actually had to contract my muscles to keep the sandwiches from hitting the ground. Anyway, great spot for lunch but share (or just eat a little for lunch and then for dinner and then again for dinner snack).

REVIEW #23:  2 stars  (621 chars)
Do not try to order for delivery.  Very unprofessional children working at this location.  We asked if they had a driver today because they sometimes don't despite the fact that they say "WE DELIVER" painted on the front window.  They said yes, it would be delivered within 45 minutes.  An hour went by, and we called to hear "We haven't made your sandwiches yet.  I don't know where the driver is."  Thanks for the call!  Nice to know you appreciate your customers.  Well, your driver just cost you a customer.  NO MORE "BEER MONEY" for you!  Done.  BTW, the cheese steak is ok, but not an authentic Philly cheese steak.

REVIEW #24:  2 stars  (482 chars)
Hate to do this to this place but as I write this review, I am very frustrated with this particular location!  This is the second time in a row that I ordered a sandwich to go and got home to find out the order was wrong!  I specifically asked for "no tomatoes and all the extras with peppers, etc" .  Both times I got home to find a sandwich with tomatoes and none of the extras!  So frustrating!  Food is good but check your orders as they have been really messing up here lately!

REVIEW #25:  2 stars  (834 chars)
I tried this sandwich restaurant just bcuz some of my coworkers kept ranting about how Capriotti's has the best subs. I tried the sub that has turkey, cranberry sauce & stuffing thinking that it was going to be delicious due to my coworkers recommendations. Well, I was wrong, that sub combo was gross. It was too many flavors that over powered each other & too much cranberry sauce. Over all gross.! Then today my husband & I we decided to try Capriotti's again, I decided to try the 6 inch tuna sub. As it turns out it was average, nothing to it, nothing special. I make better tuna sandwiches @ home than this place does. I will never come here again & I will make sure that none of my friends go to this place or waste their $$$ when they go to Vegas. Disappointed, this place is average, Subway wins this one. This place is BLAH!

I've always been a fan of capriottis but noticed that at this location my sandwiches are often wet and soggy once I get them home. I live three minutes away. Recently though I got sick from a cheesesteak sandwich. I'm hoping it was just a one time thing but I don't have the stomach to try another one yet. It might take a while to get over that

REVIEW #27:  2 stars  (1556 chars)
The only problem I have with this Capriotti's is their delivery. My friend wanted a sub & we were exhausted after a long day so we decided to have it delivered. Well NEVER again! We were told 30 minutes for delivery (I only live about 10 minutes away) well once about 40 minutes went by we called & was told "the driver should be there any minute now" after another 20 minutes I called again & was told again that the driver was on their way. I asked to speak to a manager who told me that the driver was going to be at the store in 20 minutes not to my house. Informed him that is not what we were told. All I got was a "sorry." So finally the driver arrived & come to find out it wasn't even the driver. The manager sent this employee over to deliver our subs to us because the driver never showed up at the store. This person informed us that they were waiting for the driver to come & after some time went by (over an hour) they finally decided to get someone else to deliver the subs. I understand things can happen but I don't appreciate being lied to & after more then one phone call & over an hour  wait for 2 subs (after being told 30 minutes) all the manager could say was  "sorry." I will never have delivery service from this store again & may not even give them my business again. It's just not O.K. in my book to lie more then once to a customer. I'd be more understanding if you were honest with me in the first place instead of lying to me & having me think my subs were going to show up any minute when your driver wasn't even @ the store.

Their sandwiches just miss. ...  ... The pastrami, steak and turkey are plentiful, but flavorless. ...  ... I have had better at other Capriotti's and certainly at other sandwich shops.

REVIEW #29:  1 stars  (456 chars)
I happen to like he foo but at this particular location they are so rude! The customer service is non existent. I walked in to an empty place for lunch 20 minutes ago and waited by the register for 10 minutes for someone to help me. 4 employees behind the counter watching one employees show off his spatula skills in the air. No one came over to me to ask "may I help you"? Until I started to walk out. Needless to say, I kept walking. They really failed!

I ordered the food for the first time here and decided to order delivery the lady I called asked me to hold and put the phone down I listened to her take about 15 orders while I waited 10 minutes for her to return to the call. I decided to call back and it has now been 1 hour and 15 minutes later I still had not received my food. I called to see what was wrong and told them it had been going on two hours I've been trying to eat and they need to do something. He had no sympathy for me and told me they got the address wrong ect. Horrible customer service and I'm still paying for this. Bad service wouldn't recommend delivery for anyone. Very poorly run.

This review is based on the cleanliness, not the food quality. I will say this, this location is a CESSPOOL, filthy as hell. I believe the owner of this location owns the one on E. Sunset & Stephanie St. at least that is what a few of  the employees told me, because I commented on how dirty the place was. I asked who the owner was, they wouldn't tell me their name, but mentioned the other locations. Shame on you, I don't mind paying 9 dollars for a great sandwhich, but clean the damn shit hole place up!!!!!!!!!!!

We should not expect much from part time help and Capriottis does not disappoint.  Could not get. Anyone to answer the phone after three attempts. They have lost their way from the heady days when they imported bakers from the east coast. We will not try again..

This my "Ish". I love the Bobbie and skaw-b-jo. The guys at the counter are cool(most ) days. They've come through w/hook ups and good service.

REVIEW #2:  5 stars  (347 chars)
This place is spectacular! Yes they use fresh food to make these huge sandwiches and the place is super clean. But for me its all about the cookies that they make each day. The cookies are hot and good I love them with milk. And I've never been more excited to tip. When you tip everyone in the place yells BEER MONEY!  The service is always fast.

REVIEW #4:  4 stars  (357 chars)
Finally, a Capriotti's that doesn't suck. After having horrible experiences with the Capriotti's on Horizon Ridge, I ended up driving to Sunset at I-515 and getting my sandwiches here. For the drive I got sandwiches made properly, and that actually tasted good. I did NOT get surly service or excuses like I received at the other location.  ...  ... 4 Stars

REVIEW #5:  4 stars  (593 chars)
I love Cap's.  I've stated that in previous reviews.  I would eat a Bobbie sandwich everyday if I could (but I can't, because I don't live anywhere near one!).   Their food is seriously awesome, and you need to take my word for it and go see for yourself. ...  ... This location is pretty small, and doesn't have much seating.  It's definitely a grab-and-go kind of situation.  Last time I was there, they didn't have Yelp check-in offer, where other locations did.  Bummer!   ...  ... The location itself gets 3 stars, but Cap's can't just be A-OK,, simply because the Bobbie is so wonderful!

REVIEW #6:  4 stars  (482 chars)
I love the Bobbie! How can you not? The people that work here are not the friendliest in town but I'm here for the sandwhich not to make friends.  Last time I came here my bf and I split the Medium but wished we had split the Large b/c it was sooooo good. We order it w/ light mayo b/c it needs the mayo but trying not to have too many calories.  ... I wish I could say I've had other sandwhiches here but I cant. why would you when theres the bobbie? If it aint broke, dont fix it.

REVIEW #7:  4 stars  (1246 chars)
I was a bit wary eating the Bobbie, but O.M.G. this was an AMAZING SANDWICH!  I was staying in Henderson at the time when my friend came and picked me up.  She asked me what I wanted to eat and I said I didn't care as long as it was good.   ...  ... The first thing she said was ok, we are going to get this sandwich that I have been craving for over a month and a half.  If anyone craves for something for over a month, then that sandwich MUST be delicious!  Or at least that's my rule. ;-)   ...  ... We go into the restaurant, I look around and notice there really isn't much seating inside.  We were lucky to grab three stools and sit at the "bar" inside.  My friend told me I had to try to eat the Bobbie and so I did.  Be careful, these sandwiches are HUGE!  I could not even finish a small.... ...  ... Bobbie:  Fresh roasted turkey topped with cranberry sauce and stuffing.  Yes cranberry sauce.  I was a bit skeptical when I heard that but I was open-minded enough to try.  My first bite, AMAZING!  All of the three really go together making the sandwich whole.  This is one sandwich everyone has to try!  Unless you're allergic to one of the ingredients. =P   ...  ... Also on a side note, the sandwich is cold.  Sharing is always good!

REVIEW #8:  4 stars  (315 chars)
It's your basic Capriottis but the closet to where I live. I need my sandwich fix once in a while and they are reliable. The staff is friendly and get your order out quickly.  A big let down is that they don't carry Tastycakes anymore..Thumbs Down to that but I can get them at another place if I really wanted one.

REVIEW #9:  4 stars  (906 chars)
My boyfriend and I were looking for new things to try and just happened to find Capriotti's and we weren't disappointed! The sandwhiches were pretty good. I got the Bobbie sandwhich which basically tasted like a Thanksgiving dinner in sandwhich form... it was unique and I actually REALLY like it. It sounds too weird when you read the description, but if you like Thanksgiving dinner, you have to try this sandwhich!!  ...  ... My boyfriend had the Italian sub which was just packed full of italian deli meat. They definitely don't skimp out on the meat! The sandwhich was a little greasy, but my boyfriend seemed to enjoy it. I'm looking forward to trying the philly cheesesteak next time :) ...  ... My one complaint is that the shop is a little small. There are only a few stools and a small counter to sit at to eat. So probably a good place for take out, and I'm pretty sure they deliver too! A plus.

REVIEW #10:  4 stars  (912 chars)
Not impressed at all with the Bobbie. Maybe it was poorly prepared when I tried it from this location, but it didn't have much flavor and ended up far worse than the seasonal holiday turkey sandwich at Earl of Sandwich on the Strip. ...  ... I tried the Slaw Be Jo last night. It came cold for some reason and didn't appeal to me as much as the Capastrami, Still, it's really good. Might be as little as the issue of preferring pastrami a little bit over roast beef, although the meat did seem a little dry. ...  ... Capastrami was still incredibly awesome the last time I had it. ...  ... For this particular location, place your order by phone and they'll have your sandwich ready within minutes, possibly even faster than if you place your order in person. It's worked well for me twice now. Order a large Capastrami (for the best value per inch) and share with a friend, or else fridge what you can't finish!

REVIEW #11:  4 stars  (1233 chars)
Obviously I'm not from around here, but I like to try places that I can't easily find back home. On my last trip to Vegas, I discovered Earl of Sandwich (at Planet Hollywood), a sandwich shop that I really enjoy. While prepping for this trip, I saw the Yelp profile of the Capriotti's near the Strip, so I decided to put this on my to-do list. Sure enough, when we were stopping by Costco, I saw this location at the corner and decided we had to try it. ...  ... We got a couple medium Capastrami subs and one medium Eggplant Parmesan. The latter was pretty much the same thing you'd find in any decent Italian restaurant or freezer aisle, but the Capastrami was awesome! It has a pretty sweet flavor profile with the dressing and slaw, in contrast to the Earl's salty skew, and every bite was really enjoyable for me. ...  ... However, it felt like it took a long time for them to complete our order for whatever reason, and people who ordered after us actually got their sandwiches first. On top of this place being way slower than Earl of Sandwich, I really didn't like seeing people being bumped ahead of us because we were in a hurry. Nevertheless, I'm definitely going to visit this chain again since I've gotta try the Bobbie.

REVIEW #12:  4 stars  (1217 chars)
The sandwiches are standard Capriotti's - I usually get a Bobbie, cheese steak, or  regular tuna sandwich, plus a cookie (they write an expiration time on the back so you know how long they've been out!). Consistent and good. I always order my sandwich, pop over to take care of my dry cleaning, and come back. I never have to wait long.  ...  ... Docked a star for a couple of reasons: ...  ... 1. Not really their fault, but this place is like the hotel california - you can check out any time you like, but you can never leave! It's a Henderson thing. You can't turn left anywhere! If you exit on Marks you have to turn right, but then the first opening is too narrow to reasonably make a u-turn, so you end up having to make a series of lefts instead. If you exit on Sunset, you have to cross like 4 lanes of people getting off the freeway to even get to Marks, which isn't always easy (and I am a crazy driver from LA!) ...  ... 2. The vents are really loud and the counter is really high, so I can never hear what they are asking me. Also, since they can't see my mouth while I'm ordering it makes it harder for them to understand me, which means that both of us have to repeat ourselves a lot, which isn't fun.

REVIEW #13:  4 stars  (219 chars)
This shop was as good as most Capriotti's around town. The service was fast. The food was good. I got The Bobbie, one of my favorites. The store was clean. I got my sandwich to go so I could eat like a slob in private:)

REVIEW #14:  3 stars  (1459 chars)
After seeing all the Capriotti's throughout the Valley I decided to finally try it.   ...  ... It was an adventure getting there.  The BF turned to fast out of the Best Buy parking lot and I didn't get a chance to tell him he could just go through the Home Depot parking lot.  Oh well.  We had to do a series of turns since in Vegas that's your punishment for not knowing exactly where to go.   ...  ... Once we got there business seemed pretty slow.  It was around 8pm when we got there and you have to wonder why it was so slow.  The employees were nice though.  They took our order and we waited about 5-10 minutes for the food.  I don't know what's up with the $1.50 water though.  I think that's also a Vegas thing.   ...  ... I ended up not getting the water because I prefer my Brita'd tap water.  I got the Capastrami (small 7.50) which I enjoyed.  It has pastrami and cole slaw on it.  I liked that the bread was neither too hard nor too soft.  I'm not a fan of cole slaw but I have to say that it added a nice touch going along with the pastrami. ...  ... BF got the Cheese Steak sandwich (Md 8.25).  He said it was "okay."  He prefers a whole bunch of cheese and bigger peices of meat (that's what she said).  I myself would have prefered more cheese on his sandwich as well.   ...  ... I will be coming back since the sandwiches are ok.  I think I would have to be in a mood for them though considering how much they cost.  I'm such a cheap skate.

REVIEW #15:  3 stars  (672 chars)
The food here is so delicious but the customer service wasn't the greatest. When I ordered my sandwich i was asked if I wanted a drink and I said I wanted a water from the fridge that they have behind the counter. He said they would give it to me when I paid. When my food was finally ready a different employee took my money but was talking to a man that looked homeless the entire time. I asked for my water but he was so busy with his conversation that he didn't hear me. It's not a big deal because its only water but I thought it was rude for him to have a personal conversation while I was trying to ask him for something and pay so I just gave him my money and left

REVIEW #16:  3 stars  (302 chars)
was good enough bread.  As a vegetarian i can't say anything about the meat.  Produce was standard enough.  The staff is friendly enough.  A little better quality food than subway type sandwiches so worth a little more as reflected in price.  Still feel like its fair for the food.  Worth checking out!

REVIEW #17:  2 stars  (1119 chars)
Boyfriend and I stopped here on the way home from Costco. Being frequent customers at other locations, we knew just what we wanted. Me: Grilled Italian, no cheese, with hot peppers. Him: CaoleTurkey, no cheese. Bit of a wait, but no worries. Then our name is called and Boyfriend headed up to the register. He paid, then we had to wait another 5+ minutes for our sandwiches. I thought this was odd, being that all the previous customers had their names called, paid, got their food and walked out the door within a minute.  ...  ... We got home and opened those white paper wrappers with much gastronomic anticipation. Him: gleeful! Me: not so much. My Grilled Italian could not have been in contact with the grill for more than 30 seconds, total. There were no delicious, crispy edges. No radioactive orange grilled meat grease. The sandwich was just warm all the way through, like it had been left sitting in the sun for a while. Also, there were no hot peppers to be seen.  ...  ... Bottom line: your sandwich at this location may not be the same as your sandwich at all the other locations. Disappointing, big time.

Havnt had a chance to eat my sandwich yet but the one girl in the sunset store was so rude i know im not going back again after she charged me extra for sandwiches i didnt order and had to fix my order a few times i asked if they gave any military discounts to combat veterans she responded "why do they deserve a discount" my receipt name said javon but she was the only girl working there at the tine lost my buisness and anyone i can tell to people die everyday for your freedom dont ever forget that

My boyfriend and I were very upset with this place! We had never been there before and so we took a chance, never again. The employee who helped us was very rude, and didn't make our sandwiches right, and of course we didn't find out until we got home. All around we will never return, due to the terrible service and quality of the food.

On our first stay in Henderson, we just discovered Capriottis, and are so pleased we did.  Carlos, the manager was extremely helpful.  The food was delicious.  Carlos made the sandwich for us.  They are known for their philly cheesesteaks, but we opted for a fresh turkey sandwich.  It was great.  We highly reccomend this location, and will be back during our stay..

REVIEW #3:  4 stars  (616 chars)
There's not much to say about the Vegas sandwich titan that is Capriotti's.  This is a solid location on the corner of Lake Mead and Boulder Highway (Albertson's shopping center), formerly occupied by Boardhouse Subs.  Since it's very close to our house, I've already been a few times since it opened.  The service was a bit slow in the beginning, but they are learning and improving very quickly.  The last time I went in you would never know that this place hasn't been open long.  There are several places to sit, it's a good sized location with plenty of parking.  Glad to have this addition to the neighborhood.

REVIEW #4:  2 stars  (228 chars)
It's a sad day when they can't even make a bobby right after standing and directing them on how it should be made from over the counter. Maybe when they can listen to a order and make it correctly I will try this location again.

REVIEW #5:  2 stars  (228 chars)

REVIEW #6:  1 stars  (1388 chars)
Best sandwiches!!! I am very sad however that I  will be driving to another location from now on. They were very rude and acted like we were asking them to walk 10 miles because we asked them to put our orders on separate tickets. The assistant manager rolled her eyes and acted like she wanted to slap us. Then, when I asked to add chips and a drink to my order the girl told me to hold on, gave me my coin change and kept my 11 dollars and set it in front of her. She added my chips, rang me up then tried to hand me back a few quarters. I then asked her about my drink and she informed me that I didn't order a drink. I told her never mind. When I asked her for the rest of my change she told me she gave it to me. I told her, "no you didn't" and she got an attitude and told me, "I know for a fact I gave you your change." I emptied my pockets and showed her all I had was the coin change she gave me. Then the Assistant manager  Donna again acting like we were bothering her told her just to give it to me and she would count it later. Well then when I tried to call the manager Carlos, he was in a meeting and then left. I guess the business of our office and corporate office meeting once a month are not important enough for him to call me back.  ... VERY BAD SERVICE, IF I WAS THE OWNER, I WOULD FIRE THESE RUDE PEOPLE AND START OVER WITH PEOPLE WHO CARE ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS!!!

REVIEW #7:  1 stars  (1351 chars)
We were so excited when Capriottis came to our neighborhood! We get them any time we are nearby one, so how perfect that they are 2 minutes away now. But too bad they CANNOT make a sandwich the way it was ordered. Four times, FOUR, we have gone and each time they have totally screwed up. We take them to go and when we get home and open it up, it's the biggest disappointment. We only order the spicy Italian with peppers and mayo. That's it! Nothing too crazy or complicated. Yet every time it isn't right. Twice we have come home with just a regular Italian sandwich, once we came home with a spicy Italian without the peppers or mayo, and the last time we came home with a Philly! A freakin philly! I called them and told them about it and they said to come back they had it waiting for us. So my husband brought the philly with him just to show we weren't lying and they gave him the Italian and wanted the philly back! Mind you, this Philly has already come home with us, opened it up and everything. I really hope they didn't give it to the person who really ordered it. But they should have let my husband keep it for our trouble. Anyway, so he brings home the spicy Italian sandwich and guess what? It was a plain Italian with not even oil on it. That was the last straw. We will not be wasting our money there anymore. Such a disappointment!

Comparing Capriotti's to Subway is like comparing some place like Red Robin to McDonald's. Subway is good fast food, but Capriotti's sandwiches are works of art.  The Bobby of course stands out, but the Capastrami and Slaw B Joe are real treats.  Want something more traditional? Have their Italian.  Their bread is wonderful.  Be sure to call ahead, so they have your order ready when you get there.

This is my favorite sandwich shop.  I love all their specialty sandwiches but especially their Bobbi which always helps when I am craving a bit of Thanksgiving since its made of homemade turkey, cranberry sauce and stuffing.  This place is so yummy!

REVIEW #4:  5 stars  (95 chars)
This sandwich shop rocks. They are a chain but consistently good no matter which one you go to.

REVIEW #5:  5 stars  (1033 chars)
When I get a craving for a Bobbie, watch out. Nothing else will do. A Bobbie, for the Capriotti Virgins out there, is like Thanksgiving on a sandwich. Turkey (not that thin sliced stuff, but turkey like you'd have the day after Thanksgiving!), cranberry sauce and stuffing with some mayo.  ...  ... I will admit, I was skeptical at first. It doesn't quite sound as tasty as it is. But man, it is SO good.  ...  ... The Bobbie is the only thing I order at Capriottis. However my husband gets different sandwiches and I steal a taste from time to time, so I can confidently say that the Grilled Italian is also quite tasty...  ...  ... Capriottis is fairly quick (I almost always call my order in so I rarely wait), has friendly employees (love how happily they cheer for their 'beer money' when I throw a dollar in the tip jar) and the portions are VERY generous for the price. Sometimes people get sticker shock when they see a menu, $8 for a sandwich seems a little high. But when you see the sandwich, you realize it's a good deal.

REVIEW #6:  4 stars  (445 chars)
Delicious sandwiches! The turkey is shredded and takes similar to home cooked crockpot meat - yum. The Bobbie is a great sandwich, Thanksgiving all year around! I usually get mine without cranberry as I don't want all the sugar, but the stuffing is delicious. The cole turkey is also a tasty sandwich with coleslaw and Russian dressing but can be a little messy so beware.  ...  ...  ... Staff never seems particularly happy to be there, though.

REVIEW #7:  4 stars  (822 chars)
OK, finally made my first trip into a Capriotti's, and I have to say, I'm impressed.  I'm from NJ originally so my standards for Cheesesteak sandwiches are pretty high and that is the only reason it gets a 4, instead of a 5.  The shop was clean, well staffed and though there was a line I was on my way out the door with lunch in hand in less than 10 mins. How I went 6 years (4 of them right down the street from this location) and never stopped in is beyond me, but I'm glad I did.  Looking forward to trying the Chicken Philly next time around.   ...  ... Oh yeah....be careful...12" is a medium...the large is a staggering 20".  That is was justifies the higher than normal prices (bigger than normal sandwiches...step down a size from what you get elsewhere and it will cost the same, be as filling and taste better).

REVIEW #8:  3 stars  (984 chars)
I still love Capriotti's, but the employees at this location has been slacking lately.  ...  ... In the past, as soon as I walked through the door I was greeted, usually by multiple employees. On the last few visits, there have been multiple employees behind the counter, but the majority seem to be socializing with each other rather than actually working.  ...  ... I recently called in an order, picked it up and realized when I got home that I had been given (and charged  the higher price for) the wrong sandwich. ...  ... Annoyed, I went back to get the correct sandwich. The guy that helped me was apologetic... but I expected more for the trouble then being offered a free bag of chips, particularly when I had been overcharged.  ...  ... It sucks that the employees here aren't trained to provide better customer service, because I really like the food. I go to another Capriotti's location near my work for lunch from time to time, and never have problems with the employees

REVIEW #9:  3 stars  (1237 chars)
This place has been opening a plethora of shops around the Vegas Valley. They are a welcome addition to the sandwich shops of the valley, but they aren't going to be taking the throne away from Subway anytime soon. ...  ... For the positives, Capriotti's has excellent service. The employees in here are always friendly, with a good sense of humor, and are willing to help you out and answer questions. They have a decent selection of items, including the Bobbie, their trademark sandwich that pretty much crams all things Thanksgiving into one small space. They also have a cooler with many drinks to choose from, including stuff not many other places have, such as Sobe and Cherry Pepst.  ...  ... Unfortunately, the place doesn't quite stack up against places like Subway. Their selection of items/toppings/sauces/inc. pales in comparison. And the prices are outrageous. For 4 of us to eat there last night (with only ONE of us getting a drink!), it was over $30. For that price, you might as well just go to a dine-in restaurant! ...  ... Capriotti's has quality food, I just wish they had a better selection of items and lower prices. If you're in the neighborhood, they are worth checking out - but keep your expectations in check.

REVIEW #10:  3 stars  (842 chars)
Well again I must warn I have high standards for subs . These are clean & fresh and not bad, much better than subway which literally smells like swill to me. So if I could rate 2 1/2 stars I would. ...  The counter people are ok, not bad, not good.. they do their job.  ...  Steak and cheese is kind of bland... extras are expensive (mushrooms etc). Also did he order wrong or do they not have pickles?! Isn't the point of ordering out NOT to have to do any cooking or adding of your own pickles from your fridge?! The meatballs are ok. ...  Lots of bread, I wouldn't go so far as to say they are skimpy because they aren't but there is something missing to me... maybe it's veggies.. or sauce,... Dunno... I hated their idea of roast beef... we have been here a few times over the years, never a bad experience just never a great one either.

REVIEW #11:  3 stars  (1122 chars)
Well, despite saying I would not go back my wife is like the Steak and Cheese is the bomb. So for once instead of me dragging her into some new place she's dragging me into a place. So I'm like since I'm here I might as well try something.  ...  ... The Italian with spicy and sweet peppers had just the kick I was needing.  ...  ... Ok, so I like the Italian. But the Bobbie thing....still kinda freaks me out. I'll end up likely holding my nose and trying Kimchi somewhere off of Spring Mountain before I'll try the Bobbie again.  ...  ... Oh and one last thing. My 2 year old likes meatball sandwiches. Capriotti's doesn't have diddly for kids. Ownership fail is what I attribute that to. Like at least offer an off menu choice and don't tell me I have to get a 9 inch for him. And just because you close in 15 min...don't even say anything about it. I read the tip jar, it says Beer Money on it...and I'm sure it was going to be spent at the liquor store next door but don't be pissed off at me because I delayed your clean up to get the heck out the door.  ...  ... 3 Stars. It beats the 1 star I gave them last time.

REVIEW #12:  2 stars  (403 chars)
This is a fast food place that has slow service and bad food. The sandwiches are also very expensive and not at all worth the price; they charged me $8 for a sandwich that should not cost more than $4.My question is why go to this place when you can order a take out from any of the surrounding restaurants. The food will be way tastier, will cost almost the same and the wait time will be much smaller?

REVIEW #13:  2 stars  (249 chars)
This was my first time here and I was not impressed. This location in Henderson was dirty. The tables were all dirty. Trash on the floor. The sandwich was way too big and expensive. Also no fountain soda. I don't get the hype. I won't be going back.

The wait is ridiculous! And compared to the others in town this one STINKS. And would NOT honor the VIP Free sandwich card. NO-ONE in the place looked happy.

These guys are always on point with their sandwiches. My husband and I come here on a regular basis. The ingredients are fresh and tasty. Today's visit however left somewhat a 'bad taste' in my mouth. Not because of the food mind you but because of our cashier- Jennifer.. My husband and I are heavily tattooed, with that being said people will ask us about tattoo's and even try to get quotes on tattoo's. We don't mind this what we do mind is when people like Jennifer show us tattoo work on them from scratchers/ kitchen magicians- these are people who tattoo illegally out of their homes!! Not only is this illegal bit it's not safe! So it really gets me worked up when they think the work they got done is good and when they think my husband charges too much money. He works for a very well know established tattoo shop. Typically when people tattoo out if their home there's a reason for this. They suck! ... I just thought this was very unprofessional and honestly she may have hepatitis from getting tattooed in someone's kitchen so we will not be returning to this location! Good luck Jennifer with your shitty tattoo's & scratcher artist.

Hey Yelp, I wish we could give out NEGATIVE STARS.... ...  ... ******************************************** ...  ... Unfreakinbelievable.

So I go online with the laptop, place my order, get in the car to head out and get a call: Sorry, we're out of bread and we closed the store an hour ago! ...  ... ARE YOU FREAKIN KIDDING ME? ...  ... I have never, EVER had anyone cancel an online order on me, and when a sandwich shop can't even keep their most basic item, bread, in stock, then they've got a damn problem.  ...  ... Venting my frustration even more.... I finally got a whole group of people to figure out what they wanted to eat and jump through a byzantine crappy website only to get told sorry...we can't get our head out of our rear end enough to order enough damn bread.... ...  ... Oh and they want me to come by the store to process the debit card refund sometime tomorrow...I have a damn job, I don't have time to come back and deal with stupidity. Refund? How about I pick up the phone and yell CHARGEBACK to my credit card company tonight instead!  ...  ... Placement on my Jackassery! list is about as guaranteed as it gets.  ...  ... I don't do stupid and clueless, and especially not when social media lets me light you up over it. And this experience was an example of both.

We have been to this place on two separate occasions. First was due to the ratings on here so we thought we would try it out. ...  ... But when we got there the people were rude sloppy and in a hurry, yet there was only myself and another customer. ...  ... I was thinking we just hit it on the wrong day, so we went back again for another try. ...  ... The second time was even worse. The kid behind the counter wasn't even interested in taking our order so we ended up leaving and going somewhere else. ...  ... I'm not thinking we will try again or recommend this place to anyone. ...  ... The staff just seems to be to irresponsible and just interested in their paycheck not their customer service.

Well....tried this place again....hoping it wouldn't be as bad as the last time!  And it actually was even worse!  The kids that work here are always yelling "Beer Money"!  And they aren't even old enought to drink!!!  The place was so filthy...that I should of just walked back out!  The tables are absolutely disgusting!  Every single one of them were covered in a sticky dirty bacteria infested grime!!!  And the floor!!! OMG!!!  I wouldn't even let my dog walk on it if I had to!  It looked like it hadn't been cleaned in  months!!!  And lets not forget about the 20" Bobbie I ordered to go!  These kids in here are so unprofessional...and act like they don't have a clue as to why they are standing there!!!  I told the kid....Extra mayo, cranberries and easy on the stuffing....as I would like to taste the turkey...not just a stuffing sandwich!  Well...thats exactly what I ended up with!  The 20" roll was so dry and hard...that you seriously couldn't even eat it!  There was about a tablespoon of cranberries on it....so little mayo that I couldn't even see it!  And Filled with stuffing and barely any turkey!!!  This is the second time I went to this location....which is why I was very clear and specific how I wanted my $14 sandwich!  It was absolutely pathetic!  I've been to other Capriotti's...and they were nothing like this one!  These kids are completely clueless.  And management are obviously a bunch of idiots!!!  If the health department came in this place....they would shut them down!!!!  This place is horrible!!!  They don't even deserve 1 star!!!!

REVIEW #20:  1 stars  (820 chars)
What in the world do Vegas locals see in this place? I just don't get it. The Bobbie, the famous Thanksgiving dinner in a sandwich gets rave reviews. Take turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce, and mayo and stick it all on a bun and sell it to the masses.  ...  ... It is one of the most vile concoctions I have ever put in my mouth. Bleech is being too kind. I am not one to waste food but this sandwich got tossed in the trash can. After being seriously underwhelmed I decided to try something else..I ended up with the Capistrami: Hot Pastrami, Melted Swiss Cheese, Russian Dressing, and Cole Slaw. Great concept, failed when it comes to taste. It too ended up in the trash.  ...  ... This is one place that I can say I won't be back to and it's pretty much guaranteed. The 1 star since I have to give one is for service.

A lot of places claim to have cheesesteaks that taste just like the ones in Philadelphia.  This is almost always false.  I've lived in Philly, and most don't come close.  Capriotti's is not quite the same, but still really, really good.

Can't go wrong with Capastrami, or The Bobbie! But my fave is a Homemade Turkey on Wheat, Grilled Onions and the whole sandwich grilled -- so everything melts together! Yummmmm!

REVIEW #6:  5 stars  (215 chars)
Capriottis is famous for "The Bobbie" which is basically thanksgiving in a sandwich. However, their cheese steak is a better choice. I Ordered it with jalapenos and mushrooms, my mouth is watering thinking about it.

One word BOBBIE !!! It's the best sandwich ever created! ...  ... These guys and gals make the best sandwich on the planet. Every other sub shop just can't come close to the magical thanksgiving day celebration that takes place in your belly after consuming one of these masterpieces!

REVIEW #10:  5 stars  (350 chars)
Well what can be said that hasn't already been said about caps ... Nothing I guess.The Bobbie is the best sandwich in Vegas  ...  ... All the sandwiches are top notch  ... The best hot sandwich is the ...  Cheese steak with hot and sweet peppers  ...  ... Call the order in to go  ... They take 500 years to make one sandwich  ... It's still worth it

REVIEW #11:  4 stars  (220 chars)
Always love coming to Capriotti's. They have a fantastic meatball sub and of course the Bobby. I will continue to try the different subs off of their menu but of course always have a go to when I am not sure what to get.

REVIEW #12:  4 stars  (424 chars)
DELICIOUS sandwiches and pretty lively customer service. Personally, I think the Cheesesteak is the best...and I don't even usually like cheesesteak! ...  ... There are only 2 reasons I'm not giving this a 5/5.  ...  ... 1. This location has little seating compared to other Capriottis.  ...  ... 2. The service -is- a little slow at times, so make sure you have about 10 or 15 minutes to wait, especially during busy hours.

REVIEW #13:  4 stars  (1228 chars)
Like ABC Stores in Honolulu, HI, there is a Capriotti's in almost every strip mall in Vegas and it's surrounding suburbs.  I chose this one to review because I frequent it the most. ...  ... I would love to give Capriotti's five stars but cannot.  On sandwiches, I am 2 for 3 here.  I will go from worst to best. ...  ... The Bobbie.  I know that this is what Capriotti's is known for, but it is not a good interpretation of Thanksgiving on a bun.  When I had it, the texture is off-putting.  There is just too much mush.  The sandwich is okay, but when you have mushy stuffing, wet cranberry sauce, extra mayo, and mushy bread (because of wet cranberry sauce), all you get is mush.  Sorry Bobbie, but you are not the one for me. ...  ... The Italian.  This is salty goodness.  Delicious Italian cold cuts, pepper relish, slaw, and great bread.  Enough said. ...  ... The champ at Capriotti's: THE CAPISTRAMI !  Make sure to get it with the PEPPER RELISH (so damn good) and the Russian Dressing on the side so that you can dunk the sandwich in it.  No offense to the Bobbie, but if you try one sandwich at Capriotti's, make love to yourself and get the Capastrami. ...  ... Make sure you get off the strip and enjoy Capriotti's!

REVIEW #14:  4 stars  (1212 chars)
Probably everyone says this, but their The Bobbie sandwich is like a Thanksgiving meal in a sandwich, minus the pumpkin pie of course. It's amazing! They shove in a generous helping of shredded turkey, cranberry sauce, and stuffing. I'm not a fan of stuffing, but when it's in this sandwich, I can't help but eat it all. The only thing that I'm not fond of is the mayo. You can request them to lessen the amount of mayo, which is what I do, but if you forget, they really pile that stuff on. So remember if you don't like mayo, you better say something. Their sandwiches comes in different sizes, I forget the actual lengths, but the medium is enough to feed 2 people with a little space for dessert, always a plus. ...  ... Also, the service here is pretty great. They are super friendly and they work together like a well oiled machine. I've never had a problem with waiting long for a sandwich, but the times I've been here, it wasn't very busy. This store recently changed locations to just a few doors down, but now it's like an actual restaurant with tables and such! When you're reminiscing about a delicious Thanksgiving feast, this sandwich will curb your cravings until Thanksgiving comes around again.

REVIEW #15:  4 stars  (720 chars)
This one is in a little strip mall... off of Paseo and Stephanie... (there are others around Las Vegas..) ...  ... Really like this sandwich place... quality sandwiches with quality ingredients. I go here when I'm jonesing for a good sammy.  This beats Subway all to heck. ...  ... I like the Bobbie, the pastrami and the Grilled Italian.  Pretty much all their sandwiches are really tasty... highly recommend the Hot or Grilled ones. ...  ... Their "medium" is 12" and big enough for 2 people. ... Their "large" is 20" and it's huge... so if you're super hungry... or have 4 kids that can share a sandwich... this is a good way to go. ...  ... They don't do sides... but they have an assortment of chips to choose from.

REVIEW #16:  4 stars  (284 chars)
Visited this place last time I was in Vegas. The sandwiches are quality and the menu is quite creative. Next time you are in Henderson, please look this place up - it is worth the search. ...  ... A pastrami sandwich, filled with cheese and cole slaw. Yum. ...  ... Bring cash - No CC

REVIEW #17:  4 stars  (460 chars)
Where's the beef? ...  ... I've been eating Capriottis for years, when the only store was on Sahara.  My two faves are the mushroom cheesesteak and the meatball with provolone.   ...  ... On my last two visits, I was disappointed to find far less meat than I had been accustomed to.  Cost cutting?  Bad economy?  Oversight?  I'm knocking a star off for that.  Whatever the reason, the sandwiches were still tasty as ever.  Hopefully they won't skimp next time.

REVIEW #18:  4 stars  (534 chars)
You really gotta love Capriotti's sandwiches!  Between the Bobby and the cheesesteaks, this is one of my and my husband's favorite sandwich shops.  The service is ridiculously good and the people are so friendly.  I sometimes think it's a little bit expensive for what it is but whenever I'm craving a sandwich from here it always hits the spot.  I like the Green Valley location better because they have fries (their fries are SO delish.  Don't judge me...) but this is a great walkable lunch spot for us so it's high on my rotation!

REVIEW #19:  3 stars  (19 chars)
Nice sandwich shop.

REVIEW #20:  2 stars  (825 chars)
"Get the Bobbie if you love America" ... "Get the Bobbie if you love Thanksgiving" ... "Best sandwich spot in Vegas" ...  ... So, I got the Bobbie. It sounded like a great sandwich with turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce, and mayo (I got mustard). Major disappointment. Didn't know it was a cold sub or I would have ordered something else. It's basically your Thanksgiving dinner leftovers tossed between a french roll. The bread wasn't toasted, the cranberry sauce was too sweet, there wasn't enough stuffing, and the veggies I ordered on the side had the freshness of your local Subway.  ...  ... Paid $8 and some change for a 12 foot, which isn't bad. But next time I want a sub I'll make my way over to Safeway and make my own.  ...  ... Make the Bobbie hot!!! Two stars because the staff was extremely nice and welcoming.

I ate here on dec 12 2013 and got FOOD POISONING . I was sick for 2 days . Friendly service and good sandwiches do not make up for serving bad product to guests.

REVIEW #22:  1 stars  (418 chars)
I'm a vegetarian so there are not too many places I go to eat. I went to this place and tried their veggie turkey sandwich. It took about two hours for the nausea and stomach pains to start. I don't know, maybe food poisoning? I bet there are not a lot of veggies eating there so maybe the soy turkey was old and bad? It's the next morning and my esophagus and stomach are on fire. I can't eat or drink anything. Ouch.

REVIEW #23:  1 stars  (788 chars)
Placed a large order for a party last night. All sandwiches were great except the Cheesesteaks (1 20 inch and 2 12 inches), which were overcooked and dry with very little meat, cheese or flavor.  When I called the restaurant to complain, I was told to bring the sandwiches back in, but since I had a party going on at my house, this was not feasible.  I was then told to bring the sandwiches in the following day for 1/2 credit. When I requested a refund or a full credit toward the same sandwiches, I was told no. I feel they should back their quality better than that.  We were very long time customers who always order this particular sandwich, so we know what the quality should be.  We will no longer patronize this location as they were very rude and do not guarantee their quality.

REVIEW #24:  1 stars  (995 chars)
Ripped off today.  I ordered a couple of sandwiches, including a steak and cheese, my favorite.  So after 16 mins I realize something's wrong, especially after everyone but one person who ordered after me has left the place or are eating their meal.  My wife who is facing the counter says, the counter girl just asked about a steak and cheese.  So I get up and they magically are wrapping up my sandwich.    ...  ... I sit down and there is so little meat it's not right.  Given that they were just wrapping and the bread was cold (i.e. no heat dissipation), leads me to believe my order was lost/forgotten.  They just scrapped some steak from another order and quickly wrapped it up.   The counter person knew I was annoyed at waiting so it's not that they didn't have an opportunity to correct. ...  ... Needless to say a very bad survey and this Yelp.  Employees need to know or be taught how to handle errors and address them, not how to hide it and piss off a customer with a Yelp account.

REVIEW #25:  1 stars  (746 chars)
What happened to this place? I was craving a Capistrami so stopped at this Capriottis, what a disappointment. When I walked in there was a couple waiting to order. There were 4 employees in the back and no one up front. ...  ... As the lady was coming up to take their order the phone rang and she answered it, taking a large to go order while we stood there waiting. After taking our orders there was still no one making the sandwiches, they were all in the back still. ...  ... After I finally got my order I unwrapped the sandwich. It was mostly bread (which didn't seem very fresh) and not much pastrami or toppings. Definitely not the Capriottis I remember. Maybe it was just this location but the food and service were really disappointing.

REVIEW #26:  1 stars  (426 chars)
When I moved to Henderson a month ago I stopped for lunch and had a delicious Italian sub... Since then I've tried this place twice more: a roast beef sandwich that was so dry I had to stop chewing it and a turkey sandwich that smelled so bad I thought it was accidentally tuna. No idea what's going on here but the meats are really not edible. With so many other places you can eat in Henderson, I'd not try this place again.

Fantastic sandwiches that have that wow factor while staying simple. Love the russian slaw sandwiches but the crown jewel is the Bobbie...It's like heaven in a roll. Wish there were more locations in California.

REVIEW #3:  5 stars  (972 chars)
I've never had a better mushroom cheesesteak than at capriotti's, and I've been to philly. The bread is always fresh, the steak is always hot and peppered perfectly, the onions and mushrooms are cooked to perfection and the cheese is gooey and delish!! ...  ... Went to capriotti's Saturday night for two sandwiches, apparently they were really busy all day, but they had just enough bread for two. It was 745 pm and they were down to the last two buns, perfect! The lady had a bobbie, with extra cranberries and I had the regular mushroom cheesesteak with onions, which is my standard order. The sandwiches did not disappoint, never do. ...  ... This shop is voted "best in vegas" every year for a reason, I'm so glad they opened this location about a year and a half ago because its right around the corner from where I live and the next closest was at silv ranch and lv blvd which is about 10 mins away. I can walk to this one!  ... 5 star experience, just like always.

While Capriotti's does offer the standard sub selections, it's the more creative (and more tasty!) options that set Capriotti's heads above others.

Cheesesteak had great reviews so I tried it. Actually it was a bit dry. Surprised but I really enjoy the classic bobby so I'll look elsewhere for the next cheesesteak.

I LA LA LA LOVE this Capriotti's. The staff is hilarious (obviously from the east coast) and they always make me smile (prime example was the time I was seriously illin' so I dragged my butt to Capriotti's to pick up dinner for my family. I walk in looking like crap but I managed to put on my nifty AC/DC tshirt....the guy looks at me and says "Any chick who likes AC/DC should be able to handle a little cold." Needless to say it made me giggle). I ordered the Bobbie (AMAZING...its like Thanksgiving dinner on a tasty roll) and a Philly cheesesteak with mushrooms and onions....throw in some salt and vinegar chips, a couple of rootbeers and we had dinner (albeit not very nutritious but hey, I felt like I was knocking on death's doorstep). ...  ... All in all Capriotti's is my favorite sandwich place. The only reason its not getting 5 stars is because they close too dang early.

REVIEW #12:  4 stars  (297 chars)
Their best sandwich is the Bobbie,  the Capistrami is a close second.  I am not a cheese steak fan,  but they do an alright cheese steak.  Best part is you can get a large with some Wise chips and feed the whole family under $15.00 and $18 with drinks.  Great deal in a town of little to no deals.

REVIEW #13:  4 stars  (1082 chars)
This location is the best in Vegas. You can actually sit down and eat lunch on tables and chairs and not leave smelling like meat. I like Capriotti's but wish the other locations had better seating like this one.  ... This location was very clean and doesn't make me feel like a dirty trucker eating at the counter. This is also a convenient meeting spot when I'm meeting clients in Southern Highlands. ... I first loved the Bobbi, Thanksgiving in a sandwich sans the "moist maker" aka gravy (for you Friends fans), then went to their meatball... S. Highlands has the BEST meatball...tender, and just really fresh tasting, then I tried the Capistrami...not a fan at first because there was just too much going on, but then I learned how to order it right...hot peppers in the pastrami, extra swiss cheese, and hold the Russian dressing because the coleslaw is enough. Delish! ... I know they have good cheese steaks but I like making my own at home. ... Depending on the other locations, you better be prepared for errors and omissions on your orders...especially if you call it in.

REVIEW #14:  3 stars  (973 chars)
Overhyped. Capriotti's has some good sandwiches and some that just don't connect. ...  ... My favorite sandwich here is the Capastrami, greasy pastrami grilled with melted Swiss, generously topped with creamy cole slaw and Russian dressing. Reubenesque and held together well by the bread. ...  ... Unfortunately, that same bread is the reason why Capriotti's cheesesteaks and Italian subs don't work. The rolls on which its subs are served are hard and dense, which means they don't absorb the favors and moisture of the rest of the sandwich. ...  ... The cheesesteaks also suffer from meat that's grisly, dry and flavorless. Bland would be a word for it. ...  ... The Bobbie isn't my thing - I think mayo is gross, and without it the Bobbie sandwich gets unbearably dry. That being said, the store roasted turkey goes great on cold subs with provolone and hot peppers. ...  ... Jersey Mike's is better for cold subs and Pop's is the place to go in Vegas for cheesesteaks.

REVIEW #15:  2 stars  (223 chars)
Bland bland bland. I've tried several sandwiches in several locations. Not impressed. They sound great: coleslaw on turkey, a thanksgiving meal on a bun? Hell yeah. But then, not so much on the actual taste. They are large.

REVIEW #16:  2 stars  (601 chars)
family ordered the philly cheesesteak and the italian to share. it was ordered to go so we could eat at home. we ordered mushrooms on the philly and they forgot them. the philly cheesesteak was really bland and the meat tasted dry. no cheesewiz was used here. we got peppers in a side cup to put on ourselves and that didn't help with flavoring. the italian was the more flavorful of the two, but not my favorite. i have experienced better from capriottes. hopefully last night was just an off night from them from watching the game. please step your game back up capriottes because i use to love you.

REVIEW #17:  2 stars  (767 chars)
Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. I don't like to knock a business until I've had a bad experience more than once. This Capriotti's is the closest to me house so I've been here several times, and the last few experiences have been horrible. ...  ... I love the Bobbie and the Capastrami. The last time I ordered, my stomach was churning after eating the Capastrami. It tasted a little off but I ate it anyway. Boy did I regret it. ...  ... Whet really bugs me is their bad customer service. One time I walked in, and the girl just looked at me without a "Hi" or "How may I help you?" And they are just as rude over the phone. The staff really seem like they hate their job. ...  ... I still like Capriotti's but I won't go back to this location.

REVIEW #18:  2 stars  (2523 chars)
I was getting ready to install a new stereo in our car and wanted to grab something quick for dinner that was still delicious and easy to eat so what better than snatching up some Capriottis right? Well, I was very very let down this time. We called into the store to make the order and everything seemed great at that point since they took down the order and read it back perfectly. Soon after that the things to come should have been a fair warning. ...  ... Upon walking into this location all of the tables were occupied by very gloomy looking folks almost pissed off looking and not a single one of them had a sandwich on the table. There was a gentlemen in line before me picking up a to go order and as I stood there waiting I watched as the guy cooking everything was literally running full sprints around the back trying to get sandwiches made, and the upset patrons seemed to get even more in the dumps by seeing someone get in line.  ...  ... Before I tell you what went down with my grub let me give you our order, 1 med capastrami with extra Russian dressing, 1 med capastrami with hot peppers and mushrooms, 1 med Bobbi. All seems simple right, considering it is basically a order of all things Capriottis the basic we are known for this type sandwiches. My order was ready pretty quick so we grabbed them and went on to the house to get our grub on and upon unwrapping what should have been a delicious monstrosity of a sandwich in turn was a dry overcooked lump of letdown... The bread was so crazy dry it was like eating dry oats and to top that off the pastrami was cooked so long it was truly like chewing leaves... Not that I have chewed on leaves before. The final straw for me was that I order Capriottis at work quite a bit and when you order it with hot peppers and mushrooms they are cooked into the meat just the way I like it and for some reason the cook put my sandwich together and then threw raw hot pepper on top of the slaw and then raw mushrooms... ummmm, that is not how its done. ...  ... In my opinion a sandwich is one of those things that you look forward to eating for some reason, that is great when your sandwich is awesome but when you get a bad sandwich it is almost as bad as if someone kicked your dog or something. I wish this review was to say how amazing the sandwiches were and that I am sporting a new Capriottis shirt and hat because that sandwich was so good I want to be a poster boy, unfortunately that is not the case. I don't know that I will return to this location.

REVIEW #20:  1 stars  (1376 chars)
Capriottis is good...don't get me wrong but what gets me going back to a place is the staff and the service they give.   ... Once in a while I crave the SLAW BEJO and the BOBBIE.  This particular place is nearby my home and makes it convenient to order here and take my goody home to enjoy in front of the telly. ... When it first opened, I remember the guy that helped me.....tall, goatee...and I don't know if he has teeth cuz he never smiles.  (lol jk). ... I remember now that he was not friendly and I didn't want to go there again.   ... Well.....it's been a while and I guess I forgot how sucky the customer service is there.   ... Went there again and for the last time.  The same guy was still working there and still no smile...trying to rush me when I was trying to decide what to order.  When he was finished....rang up my stuff...NOT A THANK YOU....I was signing the receipt and he practically yanked it from me cuz I was trying to figure out which receipt to keep and which to give.  I should have said right there and then I wanted my $$$ back.  I should have gotten his name also.  But I will not forget his face that's for sure.  --and I will remember to NOT PATRONIZE this one sandwich shop.  I will take the time to drive somewhere farther for GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE and a smile.   ... For those who do not care.....this is the place to go for SUCKY SERVICE.

REVIEW #21:  1 stars  (204 chars)
Crappy service. Came in to order one sandwich. Told me 30 min wait because they are in middle of a big order.  Employees goofing off while making sandwiches. Should have one person working counter orders.

REVIEW #22:  1 stars  (1220 chars)
I have to start out by saying that I am a HUGE Capriottis fan.  I really do love their sandwiches, so it pains me to give this location such a bad review, but they truly deserve it. ...  ... I have been going to this location for many years & it always has been a sub-par location compared to the others.  I will actually travel out of my way and go to the Silverado & Vegas Blvd location rather then go to the Southern Highlands location if I can.  ...  ... I can't tell what is worse the customer service on the phone or in the store? There is no etiquette for taking orders over the phone. I order the same sandwich every time and each time they ask different questions on the phone, different ingredient options. I often get the feeling that they're not even sure what comes on their sandwiches. When I pick up the sandwich,  I never know what to expect.   ...  ... I have to agree with some of the other reviewers,  it appears the owner only recruits out of the skate park? Complementary "F" bombs and foul language at no extra charge.  On a positive side they always have sports on TV that he can watch while you're waiting for your food :)  ...  ... Do yourself a favor and skip this location. Sorry Capriottis :(

REVIEW #23:  1 stars  (235 chars)
I've been coming here for years just because I live across the street. The service here is horrible and the employees are definitely high! I wish there was a location closer cause I do like the food. My rating is based only on service.

Not very impressed.  I had the homemade Turkey Sub and the turkey was really dry and shredded.  Imagine the worse Thanksgiving Day Dinner you ever had and throw it on a bun with two tomatoes, iceberg lettuce, provolone cheese and spices.  I expected more from the sandwich.  I asked why they called it homemade turkey and was told they roast there turkeys every night...seems like someone overcooked this bird.   ...  ... They have an award winning sandwich called the Bobbie but it kind of seemed gross...imagine someone taking your leftovers from Thanksgiving and throwing it on a bun...shredded turkey, stuffing, mayo and cranberries...you lost me at the cranberries.  I did not have this sandwich but the description seemed gross.  Someone must like it because someone gave it an award!!!

The worst experience I have ever had... My boyfriend took me here a while back when we came to Vegas from Los Angeles to visit his parents (They live in Southern Highlands)... He kept saying how wonderful this place was so I was forced to try. We show up and immediately I felt tension in the air. Everything I asked about on the menu apparently wasn't available because: "The stove is turned off"... "We ran out of that bread"... "There isn't anymore meat"... I mean, I kid you not, he literally left us with nothing left to order except maybe 3 or 4 items which weren't at all appealing to either of us. Mind you, as we were asking them questions, both the manager and some kid kept smiling at each other like this was some joke. I told my boyfriend lets just go somewhere else, this isn't looking good anymore, he agreed. As we walked out, the manager called out to us "FAG**TS" and started laughing with his employee. This was by far the most disgusting place I have ever been. The employees were extremely inappropriate homophobes and the establishment itself was appalling. I pray someone shuts this place down.

REVIEW #27:  1 stars  (289 chars)
This location is full of arrogant little pricks that seam high most of the time. I leave this rating after many visits , being underwhelmed by their attitude. They act like you should be honored to be able to give them money for a sandwich. Well they'll never get a dime of my money again.

REVIEW #28:  1 stars  (502 chars)
This place has great food, however, this review is based solely on the customer service I received. I got to this location at 730, 30 minutes before they actually closed. The door was locked and when an employee came to the door he informed me they were close because they ran out of bread...it was obvious they were trying to avoid taking any orders right before they closed, And if they were out of bread that's ridiculous.  It is Very disappointing that this establishment would turn down customers.

REVIEW #7:  5 stars  (1647 chars)
I am a true Capriotti's fan. I have eaten at almost all the locations in town. I eat at this location every week and sometimes twice a week. When I walk in they know me by name and are always friendly.  ...  ... This location on Town Center is attached to a gas station.  ... it has plenty of room inside unlike the other locations to sit and enjoy one of their tasty options.The one thing I have noticed is that not each location is consistent with how the food comes out. This location is.  ...  ... I do know they hand make each meatball everyday for the meatball subs. I have only tried the meatball once and personally wasn't a fan.  ...  ... If you have never had a "Bobbie" then please try it at least once. If you love a Thanksgiving meal then you will really love this one. When people complain about it not being hot or not having gravy I wonder why they came here and ordered a bobbie?! There are lots of places that have a similar sandwich but Capriotti's invented the one and only bobbie and it doesn't come hot or with gravy! ...  ... The Capastrami (my fav) is perfect. When I order it I know it will be to perfection and each bite heaven. I have eaten two this week! ...  ... I never ever have an issue with the Italian sub. It is just a winner every time and perfect if you are heading up to Red Rock for some hiking as a picnic lunch.  ...  ... The Wise chips are a very excellent addition to your sandwich. The "Honey BBQ" is what I like to get when they aren't sold out. ...  ... You can call ahead your order for pick up. That is what I usually do because lines can be very long especially during lunch.   ...  ... They cater.

REVIEW #8:  5 stars  (281 chars)
I love that Capriotti's is next to 7 eleven,  because it was a hit day to get a slurpee.  But most of all, the Cole turkey was delicious even the 2nd time around.  I love Capriotti's and would go to bat for them anytime.  Lol.  I can't wait to try their other signature sandwiches.

REVIEW #9:  5 stars  (765 chars)
I'm not a huge sandwich fanatic but my hubby's work is right across the street from this place so he is a frequent customer here.  Last night he brought home his leftovers.  Half of a homemade turkey sub.  Wow.  I was surprised by how good it was.  The bread is perfectly soft and chewy.  And the turkey is real turkey.  Not deli meat.  In fact I was so enamored that I asked him to bring me my own sandwich on his way home from work today.  So today we tried The Bobby.  O-M-G.  Homemade turkey, stuffing, and cranberry.  SO GOOD!  I think I could eat it everyday.  Seriously.  What a great lunch/dinner option.  I'm so excited by the discovery of this place.  I can't wait to try their warm sandwiches.  I don't think I can ever go back to Subway or Port of Subs.

REVIEW #10:  5 stars  (16 chars)
Mmmmmmmm Bobbie.

REVIEW #11:  5 stars  (398 chars)
Oh, I really wish I wouldn't have discovered this place. Tried different locations around town with the same great results. Love their sandwiches. i dream about em I swear.   Love the Capastrami and the Bobby is very good too. Their sandwiches remind me of the grinders at this little joint that we ate at while we were in college.(So many years ago that my memory may be fading) Oooey gooey yummy!

REVIEW #12:  5 stars  (315 chars)
Stopped by this place for the first time got the small which is 9 inches the sand which I got was called the Bobbie it was like thanksgiving came early it was incredible. So much flavor the small is anything but small you could eat one half for lunch and the other half for dinner definitely a new favorite of mine!

REVIEW #13:  5 stars  (385 chars)
Such a tasty sandwich- other sandwich shops do not compare! I usually get the grilled italian and order olives, tomatos and pickles to it! So good and the veggies give it an extra crunch. My fiance usually orders the capistrami and it is so good that I might get it next time! ...  ... Not very healthy if that is what you are looking for though! But definitely high on taste! yum yum!

REVIEW #14:  5 stars  (315 chars)
The finest steak and cheese in or out of Philadelphia, there I said it! Now the only reason to go to Philly is to visit Benjamin Franklin's grave. Also the "Capastrami" is unreal. Great staff. The only other thing I can add is that this place is painfully good. Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!

REVIEW #15:  5 stars  (277 chars)
The guy behind the counter was funny and chatted with us, and gave us a discount for being NY sports fans ;) The sandwiches were large and stuffed well, and quick to be made. The service was great and I would eat there again to get away from the expensive places in the resort.

REVIEW #18:  4 stars  (480 chars)
First impressions are the most important. ...  ... I am so glad I stopped by this location. The lady that runs the front counter is so freaking funny. ...  ... I didn't know what to order when I got there. I saw Italian sausage and I just went for it.  ... It comes with marinara sauce, onions, and bell peppers.  ...  ... The subs are above average they definitely have a better taste and the onions were so freaking good.  ...  ... The location is very clean attached to a 7-11.

REVIEW #19:  4 stars  (705 chars)
I don't know why I love sandwiches so much. Maybe it's the bread. Or maybe its the whole eating with your hands thing. I used to go to Subway but Subway needs to step it up because Port of Subs has eclipsed them, and I also have enjoyed Capriotti's.  I used to come here on my way home from work and order a salad or a sandwich. I've also ordered delivery from them. The Bobbie is Thanksgiving on bread and fun to eat. They don't have a whole lot of variety, though. I'm never able to order anything hot at this location.   ...  ... So, this place is like a diner - no, it's one of those holes-in-the-wall places. But it's bright and clean, and the staff have always been very friendly. It's a nice place.

REVIEW #20:  4 stars  (632 chars)
I'm happily impressed with the friendliness of the staff at this location.  The last time I ordered a takeaway sandwich, I used a survey receipt coupon (fill out a survey, get a few dollars off your next sandwich) and the lady behind the counter seemed genuinely pleased that I did that.  She also gave me a free brownie.  :)  I'm a sucker for bribes, especially when they consist of baked goods.   ...  ... Still not too taken with the less-than-immaculate floors, but the sandwiches are on point and I haven't incurred any illnesses from eating them!  I'll continue to order my Bobbie until my body rebels in some form or another.

REVIEW #21:  4 stars  (1189 chars)
If I could rate with half stars then this would be 3.5 stars from me. My wife is addicted to Capriotti's but I don't share the same joy. Being from Southern California you can't call the pastrami here a true pastrami sandwich. First off all the Capastrami comes with coleslaw and Russian dressing on it... YUK! The cheesesteak here I eat during the colder months but it as well can't be called a true cheesesteak. The cheesesteak here is more like crumbled beef and you wont find any whiz here to add to it either.  ... What I do like here is the Italian sandwich and the Italian Sausage. Sandwiches come in 3 sizes from small, medium and large. The large is 20 inches so you will need a appetite or someone to share with. ...  ... Italian Sandwich..... Has  genoa salami, capacolla and prosciutini. You can have all the standard stuff added to it like pickles, onions, lettuce etc. I like the sweet crushed peppers on this sandwich they have a pickled flavor but a nice kick too.  ...  ... Italian Sausage Sandwich..... Has grilled sausage and marinara sauce and provolone. This is a really good sandwich. ...  ... Catering is offered here and delivery if you order at least 2 sandwiches.

REVIEW #22:  4 stars  (1128 chars)
Let me just start off with, I'm not typically a fan of pastrami sandwiches - I always thought they were boring, dry and salty. That being said, the Capastrami hot sandwich was a great one. ...  ... It's a soft hot sandwich stuffed with moist pastrami, melted Swiss cheese, Russian dressing, and cole slaw. ... Sm: $7.79 ... Med: $8.99 ... Lg: $13.79 ...  ... My boyfriend and I shared the medium and it was more than enough. We would probably stick with sharing a small next time.  ...  ... It was a soft, warm and moist sandwich, but the cole slaw gave it a great cold crisp texture and the Russian dressing which tastes like a homemade sweeter thousand island dressing, added a nice sweetness to the sandwich.  ...  ... I'm a saucy girl, so I asked them for an extra side of the Russian dressing to spread on my sandwich. I also asked for a side of sweet peppers and piled them into my sandwich and it turned it from good to amazing. So much better with sweet peppers in every bite! I loved it.  ...  ... A side tip to save a few, grab your sandwich and then hop next door to buy your drink. The big gulp from 711 is 99 cents!

REVIEW #23:  4 stars  (271 chars)
My friend had raved about these sandwiches being amazing. They did not disappoint. The service was quick and friendly. The bread was perfect! They even offer tasty cakes as a dessert. The only thing that I would have liked is if they would have offered a 5" or 6" option.

REVIEW #24:  4 stars  (268 chars)
This is a chain and a good one at that. I had Philly Cheesesteak and it was very good. It's amazing how many places can get such a simple sandwich wrong, but Capriotti's does it right. My buddy says all their sandwiches are good and I believe him. It's worth the stop.

REVIEW #25:  4 stars  (556 chars)
Travelling to Vegas you always get hit up on places where you should eat!  If you want some good fast food sandwiches for a quick lunch, this is a good spot if you ask me!  ... Like everyone said, tried the Bobbie and it was awesome!  Expect a tryptophan nap right after though, cuz it's Thanksgiving dinner in between buns.  And those buns can range from 6 inches to 20! (that's what she said).  The Capastrami was also good.   ... The market seems pretty saturated when comes to sandwich chains, but these unique sandwiches will make me go back.  Eat up!

REVIEW #26:  4 stars  (395 chars)
Was back in town recently visiting the old neighborhood and decided to drop in here for a bite to eat.  I miss Capriotti's, so it was nice to be able to taste my fav....the Capastrami....yum! ...  ... I like this location because it's usually not too busy, so I can find a place to sit down and grub. ...  ... The Capastrami was as good as I remembered it....heaven! ...  ... Return Factor - 80%

REVIEW #27:  3 stars  (987 chars)
after my day started at 0 dark thirty, by 12:30 i was faminous, stopped by this place next to the gas station to order a quick lunch.  One absolutely beautiful, kind, ingenue took my order to eat in. i originally wanted their "bobbie" altered to include turkey, cran sauce but no stuffing but instead ordered their cheese steak served hot (it's actually cold in vegas today). i ordered a small plus a drink. $9.00 and 10 minutes later, i got a huge sandwich (i could only eat half).  Had to change the order to go becoz of how long it took (waah!) but the bread was really soft, and what was stuffed between it was really fresh meat, grilled onions and american cheese plus veggies ordered at my request. IMHO, a little expensive for a lunch sandwich, but the small is really large for what you get. p.s. on my order chips were extra, and there's no "name-brand" kinds, they only order Wise brand chips (the kind out of the vending machine you get at rest-stops along highway routes) LOL

REVIEW #28:  3 stars  (679 chars)
Capistrami great as always.  ...  ... The service end... No friendly greeting, basically ignored for 5 minutes until they even ask if I needed to order. And no, it wasn't busy at all. The older man named James, who seemed to be in charge, rang me up while refusing to take my $3 off survey code cause it was from another store. Doesn't say anywhere on there it has to be used at the same store, and I've been allowed to do it at other stores. Guess I'll be avoiding this location.  ...  ... Also, the employees usually say thanks out loud when tipped... Either they didn't get tipped the entire time while I ate my sandwich there or they're just not appreciative of our business.

REVIEW #29:  3 stars  (408 chars)
Everyone needs a sandwich. ...  ... Infused into the gas station this business has a nice little thing going. I've had quite a few sandwich from here after filling up on gas. Each time the staff have been pleasant and respectful. ...  ... I will say that few times I've called ahead for sandwiches they have been dry or cold. But on the whole the Philly steak sandwiches are great. I'll always be repeat here

REVIEW #30:  3 stars  (1191 chars)
I have two words for you; The Bobby.  ...  ... Warning! Do not operate heavy machinery after eating this sandwich. You will be in the itis within 20 minutes.  ...  ... Fresh baked french bread, succulent daily roasted turkey, stuffing, cranberries, and mayo give you a creamy and hearty sandwich.  ...  ... The small, which is more than enough for me for two meals, rarely lasts until meal 2 as it's so freakin' delicious. I'll wrap up half of it and find myself picking at it.  ...  ... I order extra mayo/extra cran (no additional charge) because otherwise, it's too dry for me. When people try mine with the extras, I've been told that it's too wet, so it's mostly my personal preference.  ...  ... This location also sells TastyKake and Nothing Bundt Cake which are nice, light dessert options after such a heavy meal.  ...  ... I haven't fallen in love with any of their other sandwiches. Whenever I got outside my comfort zone to try a new one, I always feel like I made the wrong decision and should have kept to my tried and true.  ...  ... I love that they use plain butcher paper to wrap the subs. This way, you won't have ink smears on your hand if the sandwich goos out the side.

REVIEW #32:  3 stars  (719 chars)
This location is right beside a gas station (?) and unfortunately, the floor reflected that.  I tried the Cheyenne Capriotti's a while ago and noticed that the floor was on the dirty side....came here because it was convenient and alas, another dirty floor.  Black bootmarks and everything.   ...  ... My sandwich itself was very good (got a veggie cole turkey), but I'm a bit of a clean freak snob.  I believe that eateries should be as clean as possible, at least in the visible areas!  Who knows how sanitary the kitchen is?  First impressions count! ...  ... I'll have to try another Capriotti's location to see if the floors there are any better.  The sandwiches are quite yummy, which is the most important thing!

REVIEW #33:  2 stars  (328 chars)
Was meaning to try this place for a while. Finally tried it. Was not worth the wait. I don't know what meats they used for their Italian sub, but one looked like roast beef. Roast beef should not be on a traditional Italian sub. Bun and lettuce were soggy and fried onions had no flavor. Sub was just blah. Service was friendly.

REVIEW #34:  1 stars  (140 chars)
How do you mess up a sandwich?  Make the customer wait 20 minutes for it.  Since when should it take 3 people 20 minutes to make a sandwich!

REVIEW #2:  2 stars  (408 chars)
I love Capriotti's, we order it at work for extended staff meetings because they deliver.  ...  ... However, this location delivers when it wants to. The reason for the inconsistency they claim is based on whether or not they are busy. I will never understand why you'd miss out on sales. ...  ... We were excited when this location opened, but we're missing our old location that was always able to deliver.

Random fact of the week: There is a Capriotti's in the Regional Justice Center. Yes, you will hear the phrase "beer money!" spoken in the same building where the Nevada Supreme Court makes decisions.   ...  ... Disclaimer: I am not a Capriotti's fan but I applaud Capriotti's on their business sense.  Desperately hungry people like me, trapped in the RJC for hours on end, will do crazy things to get fed.  My desperation led me to eat at this Capriotti's, a chain I truly despise. ...  ... Capriotti's, to me, is universally gross and this new location did not disappoint.    I ordered the Cole Turkey featuring dry, overcooked turkey, sweaty provolone cheese, dry coleslaw, and one slice of tomato.  Eating this sandwich was like chewing an entire bag of cotton.  That's the Capriotti's experience!  This place was packed though, so apparently it's popular. ...  ... Needless to say, once my biological need for food was met, I threw away the rest of my sandwich.  Sadly, I'll probably be back, whether I like it or not.

A friend told me to come here and try there sandwiches.  Went there to give it a taste test to see what the rave was about. Didn't know there were a chain of this store in Vegas until we got there.   ...  ... I asked the guy what's the best sandwich there and he suggested the Bobbie.  At first I was reluctant to order that over the Capristami but ended up with the Bobbie since he suggested it.   ...  ... Who knew that thanksgiving left overs would taste so good in a roll the next day?  ...  ... The Bobbie is filled with turkey, mayo, stuffing, and cranberry sauce.  It's a cold sandwich and it tasted really delightful.  I really enjoye this sandwich so we came back the next day before leaving to get a sandwich for the road. ...  ... We got the cheesesteak with mushroom.  It was slighty spicy because of the chillis but it was really good as well.  Tried two sandwiches from this place and enjoyed both.  Will be back to try the capristrami.

After a 5 mile hike at Red Rock Canyon, my friends and I were starving. After mulling over a few choices for lunch--we ultimately decided that we didn't want anything that would wreck out appetites for our dinner at the Wynn that night.   ...  ... Thankfully, our friend recommended Capriotti's.  To be honest--I was definitely looking for some fries and ketchup--but I was open to a lunch that wouldn't undo all the calories I had burned on our 3.5 hour hike.   ...  ... Now--I'm not sure if I really did that--because my boyfriend and I ended up splitting The Bobbie.  The Bobbie seemed to be THE sandwich--the money maker--and I didn't have much energy to give my lunch that much thought.   ...  ... And thank goodness we ended up with this sub of pure goodness. It's absolutely delicious!  Seriously--It's fantastic! ...  ... Pulled turkey stuffed topped with stuffing and cranberry sauce--shoved into a huge mess in an awesome sub.  Money, I tell you! I couldn't be happier--it was simply a Thanksgiving implosion in my mouth.   ...  ... What a combination!  Capriotti's is my favorite sandwich spot hands down--and I can't tell you how excited I am to know there's one in LA.   ...  ... The Bobbie will definitely make it's way back into my belly again.

After taking a few days of vacation in this area,  I yelped around for good food, this place popped up.  After the all the hype reviews of the Capastrami sandwich,  I had to try it.  I ordered a medium sized sandwich which is 12" which came out $9.35 tax included . The sandwich comes with a generous amount of pastrami with coleslaw and some type of dressing.  First couple bites,  I was like wow, this shit is great!!  Now everytime I visit Vegas I will be hitting this place for sure and call ahead,  because sandwich is made to order!

And the Bobbie was created.  And God saw that it was good.  And God blessed the Bobbie.   ...  ... For those of us too isolated from family, too tired to attempt a full turkey, and too poor to afford all that meat, a higher power reached down from the heavens and created Capriottis' "the Bobbie". The Bobbie is a massive sub composed of freshly carved turkey, stuffing, mayo, and cranberry sauce.  Those in a spiritual crisis might just find the answer to all questions of religion and higher beings in the simple fact that the Bobbie exists.  To paraphrase Ben Franklin, "[the Bobbie] is proof that God loves us".  ...  ... Since discovering the restaurant last month, I've had three.

Being from the south and now living in Florida you rarely find a great sandwich. ... Well, look no further. The cheesesteak at Capriotti's is to die for. The melted cheese over the steak with the sweet peppers with onions and mushrooms....oh yeah you can't go wrong with the cheesesteak! ...  ... The Bobbie is also another sandwich that you must try. A turkey sandwich with cranberry sauce, mayo, cole slaw and Russian dressing. ...  ... Capriotti's come to Florida, you will have a new following of loyal customers! ...  ... 5 Stars a must try. ...  ... There are numerous locations around Vegas so find the closest one to you.

REVIEW #13:  5 stars  (729 chars)
Best Deli in Vegas.  The Veggie Turkey is outstanding.  They have made the veggie turkey out of soy and created a masterpiece of a sub.  Their most popular and best tasting sandwich is The Bobbie.  This is "Thanksgiving in a bun" as many others have stated.  Reminds me of eating at home the day after Thanksgiving.   ...  ... You will have to wait a bit longer than typical for the average deli.  Not only do they have a lot of customers during lunch but it takes the workers an extended amount of time to make one sandwich.  The combination of the two means that you will probably wait about 10 minutes for your sub.  Is it worth the wait?  Absolutely! ...  ... The small sandwich is 8", the medium is 12" and the large is 20".

best sandwich in the nation!  capastrami is a must try!  although, i heard the bobbie is a favorite but it wasn't for me...maybe cause it was cold?  and i'm a warm/hot sandwich kind of person...bonus, throw some chips in and make it all better.

Best sandwiches EVER to enter my stomach! 'the bobbie' and 'capistrami' are the two best things I had. So damn good.  ...  ... The Bobbie is like thanksgiving between bread and the capistrami is so flavorful and delicious.  ...  ... A 20in sandwich only runs you $12 which is a super generous price. A 20in in both the Bobbie and capistrami would be good enough for breakfast lunch and dinner.  ...  ... I wish they would stay open later but it's okay.  They definitely need one in San Diego!

REVIEW #18:  5 stars  (505 chars)
Best sub shop in Vegas, hands down. Not up! DOWN! The Bobby sub is Thanksgiving in your mouth, but without the family drama. It really doesn't get better than that sub. I wish I stayed longer to enjoy more sandwiches. I visited the shop three times while in Vegas and ordered the twenty-inch Bobby three times. I asked them to cut it in thirds which was no trouble at all for them. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner all in one stop. I will always visit them again. They do take orders online or over the phone.

Best vegetarian "meat" sandwiches I've had out. Got a veg cheesesteak (morning star chicken shreds) and a turkey and slaw (sliced smoked soy based turkey of some sort). Fan. Tas. Tic. Good bread, good portions, great veg meat, polite staff...I wish there was one of these near my home town. I would eat here every night. $13 for a 20" sub just can't be beat.

Call me crazy but i think capriottis(las Vegas) has better Philly cheesteaks than most places in Philly!! Their capastrami and philly subs are mouth watering! They will not let you down.its slightly on the pricier side for subs, but the taste will make up for it..

REVIEW #21:  5 stars  (492 chars)
Came back and tried the beef steak sandwich and chicken steak sandwich which were also delicious.   ...  ... Best of all they have a really good red velvet bundt cake.  You would think that bundt cakes are usually dry, but this was the best I've ever had.  It was perfectly moist and the flavor of red velvet was just the right sweetness with a few pieces of hidden chocolate chips on the inside that melts in your mouth goodness.  Such a sin to eat the whole cake yourself but it's worth it.

Came back here again during my recent trip to Vegas and this time, I bought a 20 inch cheese steak to bring back home with me to the bay. It was freakin' huge and full of meaty goodness. I'm only 5 feet tall (60 inches) so the 20 inch sandwich is like a third of my height!!!! ...  ... The sandwich was the only reason I checked my bag in and paid $15 for it. So worth it.

REVIEW #23:  5 stars  (417 chars)
Came here a couple months ago for the first time for my birthday & I finally got to write a review. If I'm writing a review couple months later about a sandwich that's still on my mind, that definitely means something. BEST PHILLY CHEESESTEAK SANDWICH IV'E EVER HAD. Bread was warm and soft. Meat was very flavorful. I will always have to come back here everytime I'm in Vegas. Or look for a Capriottis in California.

REVIEW #24:  5 stars  (158 chars)
Capistrami and the Bobbie....quite possibly the best sandwhiches I have had in my life....outside of Little Saigon of course ...  ...  ... no need to say more

REVIEW #25:  5 stars  (1328 chars)
capri-whatt?!?!? o is this pastrami heaven?  ...  ... Found you lil bugger!  Known for its hot pastrami sandwich, we came in on a lil humble cloudy day and decided to be a lil bad (for my diet). ...  ... Their sandwiches come in different size...the largest...20"...o my =O! ...  ... Stick to what it is and even though im not a big fan of coleslaw...i have to admit, its really good with the sandwich. ...  ... The hot pastrami sandwich consists of pastrami (duh), coleslaw with russian dressing, which i believe its like thousand island and something....the creaminess of the dressing cuts down the TANG of the coleslaw and the cole slaw gives the sandwich the crunch and cuts down the pastrami taste and teh saltiness of it.  Everything works well...it's definitely a recommendation from me (a picky ass eater)...the bread is a lil soft, not crunchy so its doesnt hurt you when you bite into it, esp for them drunkards.... ...  ... even though theres not a lot of ingredients, its a very filling meal and i even took my share home for later.   ...  ... i only wish it wasnt off the strip but i think its best that way!   ... ITS A MUST GO! GO GO GO.... ...  ... p.s. if you dont love sandwiches, i believe they have other stuff and they have chips and soda and its pretty decent in price....its like a local joint to chill =)

CHEESESTEAK WITH EVERYTHING ON IT!  ...  ... Now that I got your attention, Capriotti's has got some of the best sandwiches around. Every time I see one, I immediately look at the time hoping that it is lunch time or at least close to it. I have tried all their sandwiches (which are all good), but it seems like every time I go I end up getting either the cheesesteak or the capastrami. With it I always get the grilled onions, mushrooms, sweet and hot peppers.  ...  ... Of course I can't go on until I give their signature sandwich its props. The Bobbie. This sandwich is what made Capriotti's famous. Turkey, cranberry sauce, stuffing, and bit of mayo. With this sandwich, you don't have to wait til November to have it. You can have it year round!  ...  ... They only have one kind of bread which in some people's eyes are one dimensional, but in this case, their bread is so good and fresh, that I think that's all they need! Oh, did I mention they bake it from scratch every day? So you know it's gonna be fresh every time. ...  ... For more info, visit their website: www.capriottis.com

REVIEW #28:  5 stars  (115 chars)
Every time I stop into vegas (which is quite often) I have to have a Capastrami....it's that GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD!!!!!

REVIEW #29:  5 stars  (543 chars)
Everytime I make a trip out to Vegas from Los Angeles, I must stop by Capriotti's to get a Capastrami! One of the best pastrami sandwiches I've had, a mix of pastrami, swiss cheese, cole slaw and russian dressing. I also like the Bobbie, which is somewhat like thanksgiving in a sandwich! Turkey, stuffing, mayo and cranberry sauce makes this sandwich unique.  ... These sandwiches are so good, on more than one occasion I've shown up in the middle of the afternoon, and they were out of bread! I really wish they'd open one up in Los Angeles!

REVIEW #30:  5 stars  (63 chars)
Fantastic and shareable! We had the pastrami and slaw. So good!

REVIEW #31:  5 stars  (265 chars)
First time having their sandwiches was at an office function... OMG! Hands down the best I have had! LOVE the Thanksgiving leftover sub. Mouth is watering just thinking about it right now... ...  ... I only with there were more locations. But it is worth the drive.

REVIEW #32:  5 stars  (469 chars)
great cheesesteaks, i love it with white american cheese,onions,mushrooms,large , looks like a baseball bat!!! that suckers huge. they are located in a strip mall across the street from circus circus. best hogies, sausage sand, the bobbie sandwich is the bomb. turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce, thanksgiving dinner on a roll, these people are for real!!!  from delaware, jersey,philly. the real mccoy of sandwiches. if you are down in vegas hit them up. love you guys.

REVIEW #33:  5 stars  (154 chars)
Great food!! The staff was very friendly and helpful.  I ordered the Bobbie which was amazing!! I would definitely eat here again when we travel to Vegas.

REVIEW #34:  5 stars  (1039 chars)
Great great great!!  Amazing sandwiches and service!  Small but sufficient shared parking lot, close to the strip (2 blocks-ish) without the craziness of the strip, and the service is fun and busy -- large staff to fully support the orders (not 1-2 people, but 8 or more!). ...  ... First, you have to know, the secret to a good sandwich is the bread.  Here, at Capriotti's, they know HOW TO DO IT RIGHT! ...  ... Randy's Top 4 Capriotti Sandwiches: ...  ... #1 "The Bobbie" - (to die for) - moist and tender shredded turkey, cranberry sauce, and STUFFING  ...  ... #2 Meatball - (thats'a Italian to you) - great and meaty balls, super good, great sauce ...  ... #3 Roast Beef - (so dang good!) - cooked right there in the shop, super moist and tender, and shredded ...  ... #4 Chicken cheesesteak - (The Pope would say "holy moly") - tender chicken cuts, get the works with cheese, mushrooms, peppers, and onions! ...  ... Capriotti's is my favorite sandwich shop!!  There are many locations, find one nearest you (or move closer to one!)

REVIEW #35:  5 stars  (122 chars)
Great little place. I'm from Philly and against my better judgement I order a cheesesteak......it made the cut. Delicious!

REVIEW #36:  5 stars  (94 chars)
Great portions and excellent food when you have lots of driving to do.  no issue with parking.

REVIEW #37:  5 stars  (661 chars)
Great sammiches a short drive from the Strip. Get away from the ding-ding-ding whirr whirr whoop whoop and just have a dang sandwich. I guess this place is part of a chain but it kicks butt over Subway or Quizno's while being in the same milieu.  ...  ... Be warned that the large sandwich is incredibly large. My 19 year old son and I split a SlawBeJo which was piled with outstanding roast beef and slathered in thick, tasty cole slaw. As soon as it arrived, we just laughed. We were not possibly going to be able to eat the thing. Leftovers, baby. ...  ... Our friend had a vegetarian thing and liked it. Great, friendly service. Lots of locals. No Keno. Go!

REVIEW #38:  5 stars  (222 chars)
Holy crap on a cracker... The Bobbie sandwich is a little bit of heaven on a plate.  Perfect stuffing, the pulled turkey a fantastic touch, just the right amount of mayo and cranberry... ...  ... Highly, highly recommended

REVIEW #39:  5 stars  (516 chars)
Holy Shit. Ive never had a sandwich this good! ...  ... Had the small (9") cold Italian sandwich. ...  ... As described on their site: ... "A flavorful combination of italian deli meats. Made with Genoa Salami, Capacolla, Prosciutini". ...  ... Its served on a freshly-baked soft white roll (secret recipe) + all the fixins + provolone cheese. ...  ... The location is sketchy at best. Down the street from the Sahara Casino in a small mini-mall area patronized by some of Las Vegas' finest walkin the streets folks.

REVIEW #40:  5 stars  (343 chars)
I absolutely love LOVE Capriottis!!! Fast and delicious. They have an amazing vegetarian menu, which is hard to find at sandwich shops. The "Veggie Cheesesteak" is my favorite for all you vegetarians! It's vegan if you ask for no cheese :) Definitely get the sandwich with hot peppers for extra flavor. The Capistrami is out of this world too!

REVIEW #41:  5 stars  (1535 chars)
I consider myself a sandwich connoisseur.  So much so, it's to the point that the missus shakes her head at how much I love the things.  But it's the sheer amount of variety that makes them appealing. ...  ... So after reading the reviews, I had to go and check this place out. ...  ... I decided to be different and try the regular turkey sub, and it was really good.  Not the usual deli slabs of meat, but chunks, and it was moist and flavorful.  Perhaps a little too much lettuce, but I could adjust that, so who cares, really.  The missus got the meatball sub, and that was no slouch. ...  ... As I ate, I read through the reviews on here, and each one was a variant of the same message: ...  ... "Try the Bobbie!" ... "Try the Capistrami!" ... "Bobbie!" ... "Capristrami!" ... "Bobbie!" ... "Capristrami!" ... "Bobbie!" ... "Capristrami!" ...  ... "Alright, dammit, I'll try one of the sandwiches", I nearly cried out, but I figured that would only get me more unusual looks than I normally get, so I went up to the counter and ordered the Bobbie for dinner later tonight. ...  ... Holy crap, I am a convert now.  It was like magical wood nymphs placed happiness upon my tongue. ...  ... So let me join my voice to the chorus extolling the virtues of the Bobbie, and now I feel compelled to see what the Capristrami is all about. ...  ... These are FINE sandwiches.  Well worth the trip off-Strip to sample one of these.  And prices are pretty fair, all things considered. ...  ... I think I have a new haunt to get my sammich on.

REVIEW #42:  5 stars  (586 chars)
I don't think i can go to Vegas again and be satisfied without stopping by this great sandwhich shop (and Sonics) . I'd never used to go somewhere just for their pastrami- i was never a huge fan of the Hat, Top etc, even though it's good. but now good is not enough, since i know out there, there's a whole better sandwhich. The thanksgiving dinner in a bun (their turkey sandwhich) is awesome as well.  ...  ... too bad there aren't any in California. - drives me crazy! Just like how there's only ONE Sonic's within an hour and a half drive and they bombard us with those commercials.

REVIEW #43:  5 stars  (529 chars)
I had Capriotti's a couple years ago in San Diego, so I was in Vegas for the weekend and decided to stop here for lunch. This place is so awesome. Their menu is simple and their sandwiches are great. ...  ... The turkey, it's not like that thin slimy deli crap. They roast turkeys and carve them fresh every day. So it's like Thanksgiving turkey quality, shredded. So it's good stuff for sure. ...  ... Man, the 'Cole Turkey', not their signature sandwich, but soooo good. Turkey, cole slaw, provolone, special sauce on a hoagie.

REVIEW #44:  5 stars  (283 chars)
I have a friend that raves about Capriotti's.  After trying it back on the East coast, I had to have it again.  I like the grilled Italian.  It is just a really good sandwich.  My fiance got the Bobbie, the best sandwich in america, and we were not disappointed with that one either.

REVIEW #45:  5 stars  (1485 chars)
I like good food.  But if the food is so good I still remember it, then it earns its five stars. ...  ... So what do newlyweds do when they're on a road trip from the San Francisco area to the Grand Canyon, North Rim, and they're hungry?  Well, you can hit a buffet on Fremont Street or the Strip.  (We did that on the return trip.)  Or you can go to Capriotti's.  Okay, Las Vegas has other choices too.  But Capriotti's worked great for us. ...  ... Sandwiches are hard on my hunny.  She has Crohn's Disease, so her intestines cannot process most of the things that make sandwiches taste great.  She explained that to them, and they were very accommodating to her.  We ended up getting a large sandwich, half for me and half for her, and they didn't give us grief about it.  We didn't eat there;  we took it with us as we drove to Arizona, and it lasted us for two meals.  I'm a big eater, so that's saying a lot. ...  ... And guess what?  After that buffet on the return trip, we stopped by here again on the way back to California for another big sandwich. ...  ... Locals and transplants probably already know about this place, so for all you weekenders that clog I-15 on Friday nights and Sunday afternoons - you know who you are - you MUST eat here.  It's easy to miss, it's hidden away in a shopping center between I-15 and the strip.  But you'll certainly get more for your money than at the casinos.  Hey, it may end up being the most memorable part of your trip to Las Vegas.

REVIEW #46:  5 stars  (452 chars)
I love a good sandwich place, and this one is definitely worth a visit! I went here on the high recommendations of Yelp and I'm glad I did. ...  ... Freshest ingredients, excellent flavor and not just your ordinary sub/sandwhich place. I had their home made roast beef and was very impressed! By the way, if you need to feed a small camp of refugees, get the large... It's a monster! ...  ... I highly recommend it to anyone that likes a good sandwich.

REVIEW #47:  5 stars  (627 chars)
I love Capriotti's.  This is by far my favorite place to eat in Law Vegas.  Yes, this $7-8 sandwich tops the much more expensive food you can get at the buffets or other fancy joints in town.  The turkey sandwiches are made with real turkey, as in thanksgiving turkey not lunch meat slices.  The "bobby" is their most popular sandwich, which is like a thanksgiving leftovers orgy with turkey, stuffing, and cranberry sauce.  Personally, my favorite is the "plain" turkey sandwich with sweet peppers, hot peppers, and pickles. ...  ... My only complaint about Capriotti's is that they serve Pepsi, but I guess no one is perfect.

REVIEW #48:  5 stars  (303 chars)
I stopped in at the strip mall just off the strip. I tried the capastrami, pastrami with swiss cheese,  cole slaw and russian dressing. It was great, all the ingredients tasted great and the bread was so fresh and tasty.  My Dad kept talking about his sandwhich (same thing) for the next couple of days.

REVIEW #49:  5 stars  (406 chars)
I was never a huge fan of pastrami, but my friend heard good things about the Capastrami at Capriotti's so we gave it a try. The cole slaw paired with hot pastrami is definitely what makes it different- in a good way, of course. I love this sandwich, and I've had it each time I've gone back to Vegas since I first had it. I've also tried the Bobbie, which is also tasty, but gets boring after a few bites.

REVIEW #50:  5 stars  (350 chars)
I work a lot of trade shows and always ask the I&D for the best delivery option. All the labor and booth staff loves this place for a delivered lunch. The Bobbie is just like my favorite day after thanksgiving sandwich, people also liked roast beef and the capistrami. Call at least 1-2 hours ahead for delivery or well before 10am for noon delivery.

REVIEW #51:  5 stars  (1243 chars)
If you want a great sandwich this is the place! For first timers I would recommend staying away from the turkey sandwich's because a lot of people seem to think they are "dry". If I ever hear complaints about this place its because its not standard as far as sandwich shops go. What I mean by this is that they don't serve your standard BLT/Turkey club like a subway or a port of sub. If your craving taste like that its best to get what hits the spot. On the other hand if you want a new taste that will blow your mind then stop by Cap's. As a constant return customer my only complaint is that they don't stay open long enough. Most locations seem to close at 7pm and they have no 24hr locations which is a bummer. I have recently discovered that the locations inside of casinos are open till 11pm which is awesome! My all time favorite sandwich here is the Capastrami. If the kinda sandwich that makes me smile every time I bite into it :) I also constantly enjoy the cheese steak and grilled Italian. I would recommend this sandwich shop to anyone who love sandwich's. I usually leave paying between $10-18 depending on what location I visit. Some locations do not offer the monster 22in sandwich's so I have to get a medium which is less.

REVIEW #52:  5 stars  (484 chars)
If you're looking for a cheap, filling lunch, you don't have to travel far - these no-frills sandwich shops are all over town. Best known for their beef and turkey, roasted right on the premises, they serve overstuffed sandwiches (a large will feed two easily) that put Subway to shame . . . and would turn Jared into a mini-Blimpie. They also feature Italian cold cuts, cheese steaks, meatball subs, and a few veggie varieties. Five stars for a sandwich shop? Yes, they're that good.

REVIEW #53:  5 stars  (1373 chars)
It deeply disturbs me that Subway has become the go-to sub shop around the states. Apparently when the oil shortage started there was also a cold cuts bandit that held Subway hostage and now you're only allowed 3 slices of meat on your mediocre roll and if you'd like the blandness toasted, they can do that now too, oh joy.  ...  ... I would vote for Capriotti's to take over all Subways but I'd most likely gain 20 pounds from eating a sub everyday for the rest of my life. A foot long a day would make any girl happy. ...  ... Capriotti's prides itself on freshness, slow cooking and hand pulling their turkey and roast beef at the shop. The three sammys I suggest and love are the grilled italian, the cheese steak, and the signature bobbie. The first 2 are pretty self explanatory, loaded with tons of meat, cheese and veggies and beyond scrumptious. The bobbie however is specific to them and is made of  homemade turkey, cranberry sauce, stuffing and mayo. Your first bobbie will have your taste buds dancing and when you stare that sub down like Joey on Friends you'll never be the same. Every Subway you pass from that moment on will look like the talentless redheaded stepchild of the sub world. ...  ... Just in case you still don't believe me, check out the awards for these hand held wonders:  ... http://www.capriottis.com/awards.html ...  ... Ya. They. Rock.

REVIEW #54:  5 stars  (491 chars)
It's so nice when a menu has a vegetarian section.  This place had four veggie selections that used veggie protein, 'faux meat'.  I didn't have to have the usual boring cheese sandwich!  I chose the veggie cheesesteak sandwich.  It was delicious!  The 'meat' was seasoned and cooked perfectly.  My sandwich was about 10 inches long and filled with 'meat', cheese and veggies.  It ended up being enough for two meals, well worth the price!  I will definitely return on my next visit to Vegas!

REVIEW #55:  5 stars  (1432 chars)
Just sayin'......... if you're rating "sandwiches in Vegas"....... and for both taste and value..... this is my current 5-star winner. ...  ... You only have to look at the 170+ reviews, with an average 4-1/2 star rating, to feel comfortable in anticipating a decent sandwich. What put this over the top for my business associate and me was both sandwiches and service. ...  ... We were both wasted after another trade show day, standing on our feet, "gratefully" (I should qualify), talking to clients from around the US and World that visited our booth. By 5pm, we both agreed on "something simple" that we could take back to our off-strip condo's. Ironically, I'd never tried any Capriotti's location ever!? My loss.  ...  ... We order two hot sandwiches and two cold. Their "small" is 9", which is really a large in the typcial fresh-off-the-grill sandwich world. And this is a "sandwich kitchen" with a "hot-top grill", plenty of fresh onions, sweet bell peppers, mushrooms and plenty of Provalone... ready to join your grilled meats in a super "comfort food sandwich experience!" (I'd recommend you ask for "extra Provalone"... just because you can!) ...  ... My personal thanks for the three person crew that cooked and served us that early evening! It was a pleasure stopping by, and the positive food and customer service experience will now make this particular location a "Must Add" to my "Vegas Black Book of Fooderies."

REVIEW #56:  5 stars  (525 chars)
Look I won't be long winded, because with a good take out joint you don't have to be. Forget about service, atmosphere, decor and all of the other crap that consumes us when we go to have a meal out on the town. This place is just good, no great!  ...  ... Get the Bobbie now! The large will feed you for two meals. The prices are sens able and the quantities are large. Call ahead, go pick it up and prepare to pig out. You can't not like this place, and if you do I will meet you in the parking lot to fight for it's honor.

REVIEW #57:  5 stars  (601 chars)
Love Capriotti's!!! Everytime we go to Vegas, we have to come here! All of the hot sandwiches are delicious, but my favorite is the Capastrami, soooo good. Make sure to get a side the pickled sweet peppers too, they're delicious. This last time we went we also got the cinnamon mini bunt cake. I wasn't expecting it to be anything special but it was soooo good. It tasted like a cinnabon but wonderfully fluffy and light like cake, and it melted in your mouth! We also tried the chocolate one which really wasn't anything special. Captriotti's is definitely a must stop if you're going to be in Vegas!

Love the sandwiches! We came here because of that cheap Shell gas station before heading back to Socal. We saw the sandwich place and hey, they have good reviews! So we tried it out, and it was delicious. The cheese steak and italian sandwich, really good! Next time I'll try the pastrami.

Love this hole in wall place! =)  ...  ... Veggie Cheese Steak: 5 stars ... Toasty & delicious, so tasty  =) The veggie chicken they had inside tasted so close to chicken that I couldn't believe it & the melted provolone cheese just gave it a delicious finish to it.  ...  ...

LOVE THIS PLACE!  I am not a fan of the "bobbie", i am not sure if i got a bad sandwich the one time i ordered this but i just didnt like it.  i DO, however, LOVE LOVE LOVE the "cole turkey" - tons of turkey, cheese, coleslaw and thousand island dressing.  i could eat one everyday.  the "capistrami" is also great, basically the same thing as above but with pastrami.  this place is hard to beat :)

REVIEW #62:  5 stars  (433 chars)
Move over Subway, Togo's..etc. There's a new boy in town! CAPRIOTTI'S!! This is THEE go to sub place for everyone! It has your colds, hots, and vegs. The Bobby is hands down the BEST sandwich! Give me a minute (as my eyes roll back) it's filling, thick, oozes with stuffing and turkey. I've tried their other sandwiches, but this one is the best. For under $13 you can get a 20" sandwich, I mean seriously, what more can you ask for?

My favorite lunch!

REVIEW #64:  5 stars  (313 chars)
My friends told me about a sandwich called "The Bobbie". I got to Capriotti's and ordered one. ...  ... First bite, fresh chewy roll, some mayo, little turkey. ...  ... Seconde bite, all the above and now I'm getting the cranberry sauce and stuffing. It's a Thanksgiving explosion in your mouth! ...  ... Get it~!

REVIEW #65:  5 stars  (490 chars)
not to be missed in LV - especially if you're looking to save a couple of bucks on at least one meal. phenomenal value (20 inch sub for about $13), and GREAT food. since i clearly can't finish a 20 inch sub, i actually saved some of it to eat the next day and it was still good! ...  ... got the philly, sister got the hot pastrami - both were tasty but i'm partial to the philly. ...  ... note - it is a little bit far away from the strip so you'll need a car to get here. worth it though!

REVIEW #66:  5 stars  (496 chars)
now that i know about this place every time i go to vegas this is a sandwich shop for me. I wasn't expecting much but the sandwiches was much better then i expected. Due to the location being off the strip the price is cheaper and worth the side track. I recommend the Capastrami. I don't think of coleslaw being a good sandwich topping but this hot sandwich is in my opinion an awesome combination. Try it out, the place is kind of small and the location is a little out there but it's worth it.

REVIEW #67:  5 stars  (1343 chars)
Oh Capriotti's....you & I have a secret love affair and no one knows how much I truly see you!! ...  ... When I'm at work, this is my Caps location that I visit the most. It's close, convenient and even better, when I'm too busy (or lazy) to drive to pick up my sammy, they'll deliver it to me for $3.00. Perfecto! Just remember if you want your sub delivered by noon, call in no later than 10am. They are in high demand y'all. The crew here is sweet but they know how to get down to business.  ...  ... Caps has hot sandwiches, cold sandwiches, salads, kids meals and more. My favorite is their good 'ol homemade turkey with mayo and provolone. Their bread is always fresh & soft and their turkey is actually fresh turkey....hand pulled. Say whaaaaaat? Yea, it not processed crap or little circles of pressed meat. This is real, straight up turkey. Beats Subway and Port of Subs ANY day of the week. Their hot, Philly cheese steak is delectable with all that yummy melty cheese and peppers slathered about. MMM! Is your mouth watering yet? ...  ... Oh and the Bobbie? This is like a full Thanksgiving dinner explosion in your mouth - complete with turkey, cheese, mayo, stuffing and fresh cranberry sauce. Just like the sammies Mama made you with leftovers in the golden days. ...  ... Don't take my word, go try it for yourself. Like now....

REVIEW #68:  5 stars  (719 chars)
Oh the memories. My first Capriotti's experience and it didn't disappoint. Of course I got the Bobbie and of course it was excellent. I'm usually not a fan of cranberry on my  food but it really works well with this sandwich. The bread is soft and the turkey is well-seasoned,  roasted  and pulled. I also tried the cheesesteak and I gotta say, it's one of the best I've had. Get it with onions and hot+sweet peppers.  ...  ... I've tried the Capriotti's that recently opened near me. I don't know what it is, it just isn't as good as the ones in Vegas. The one in Beverly Hills is pretty good but I'm not a fan of that pretentious area. ...  ... If you're in Vegas, stop by and power up with some delicious sandwiches.

REVIEW #69:  5 stars  (404 chars)
Oh... My... GAWD! The Bobbie is AH-MAZING. Yeah- that's valley girl speak for fuckin' awesome. Fresh roasted turkey, mixed with a generous helping of mayo, topped with cranberry sauce and homemade stuffing on a deliciously soft french roll?!??!? Are you freakin' kiddin' me?  ...  ... The house made roast beef was pretty good too... a tad dry for my taste, but quite flavorful. The wise chips are legit.

REVIEW #70:  5 stars  (1146 chars)
OK so I knew I was going to be taking a a trip to Vegas so I decided to yelp some great places to eat and I found this sandwich shop, I had yelped places before and went to them not having such great experiences but I kept an open mind on my way to this shop.  ...  ... I had known I was going to try the "Bobbie" due to all the great reviews it had gotten. I'm such a sucker for Italian sandwiches though and the smell as I walked into this place smelled of Italian sub heaven!! I resisted and told myself ....no Felicia stick with the "Bobbie" you have to try new things not the same ole same ole, I'm so stoked I did the "Bobbie" was Thanksgiving deliciousness in May and it was great!!  ...  ... I've been on a diet eating so healthy and knew I was going to be taking in many many calories when I decided to bite into this stuffing goodness but it was sooooo worth it..........haha  ...  ... The place was easy to find and it was very clean inside. The guys working were nice and I enjoyed eating there. I just wanted to keep eating and eating it smelled so good. Next time ill try my Italian type sub or maybe the "Capastrami"?? We will see.

OMg.  The Capastrami.  Just typing it makes my mouth water. ...  ... The Capastrami IS SO GOOD!  My friends were TOTALLY RAVING about it, and usually when my friends overhype things it will ruin the experience for me.  But no.  This is ONE OF THE FEW times that I could not even begin to understand how awesome it would be.   ...  ... Coleslaw in a pastrami sandwich?? I know, I know, it sounds strange.  But it truly is one of the best sandwiches I've ever had.  The coleslaw is most delicious sandwich surprise EVER.   ...  ... I don't know what else to say, except that I really think that everyone should try it.  It's THAT good.

REVIEW #72:  5 stars  (1225 chars)
OMG. ...  ... Not only is everyone SUPER nice, but the sandwich is THE BEST I've EVER had in my life. And trust me when i say this, I've eaten A LOT of sandwiches!!  ...  ... I had the chicken/mushroom cheese steak with all toppings (hot pepper, sweet pepper, lettuce, tomato, pickles) It came out steaming hot and the flavor is UN-describably AWESOME. Oh my and that bread.  ...  ... My husband had the hot pastrami and that too was simply melt in your mouth amazing.  ...  ... I am so happy that my husband found this place in the Vegas book that he got, other wise, I wouldn't even know it existed. I have to say though, that I am a little upset now because ever since I had this sandwich, ive been craving it NON STOP. ...  ... Capriotti's why not open a few in San Francisco Bay Area? You can even hire me and I will be your #1 representative. Please? Maybe? Will you think about it?  ...  ... Well, there's one in LA that we can go too, but now i have to wait salivating for a few months until we go to LA!! ...  ... Wow, thank you!! Please go. You will not, and i mean WILL NOT be disappointed. And if you are, contact me, and I will seriously give you a back handed slap across the face. ...  ... Great prices too!!!!

REVIEW #73:  5 stars  (254 chars)
One of the best sandwiches I've ever had in my entire life and depending on the size it can be HUGE... ...  ... I ordered a regular cheese and chicken sandwich but a friend ordered the huge massive long sandwiches and take my word, it  really is HUGE....

REVIEW #74:  5 stars  (825 chars)
One of the best sandwiches that I have ever got! How can you not like a sandwich from here. So good, so cheap, so delicious.  ...  ... My favorites are:  ... -The Bobbie. A lot of people seemed to rave about this one. Who doesn't want Thanksgiving Dinner in a Sandwich. So good. The stuffing, the cranberry, the turkey all in one bite! Can't say no to that! You won't get disappointed. ... -Capastrami. So good! I always order this too. Hot Pastrami and cheese and cole slaw. The sandwich is a bit messy, but most foods that are messy are delicious! ...  ... Give these two sandwiches a try and you won't be disappointed. One of the places you just have to h it up during Vegas! They're all over Vegas too. Well more in the local casinos. If it wasn't for my boyfriend, I would have never found out about this place! SO GOOD.

REVIEW #75:  5 stars  (313 chars)
One of the few great things about Vegas is the fact that we have several Capriotti's in town. This place is awesome! My favorite sandwich is the Capastrami, (Hot Pastrami, Melted Swiss Cheese, Russian Dressing, and Cole Slaw). I get it with the hot peppers for a boost of flavors. Carriotti's is sandwich nirvana.

REVIEW #76:  5 stars  (316 chars)
Passing through Vegas, and a friend recommended Capriotti's for the Bobbie sandwich. The one with turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce, etc. That is one very serious sandwich, and while it is indeed a dazzling eat, the cheesesteak sandwich was even better in my opinion. So much to like here. http://oinkety.com/?p=2448

REVIEW #77:  5 stars  (230 chars)
Probably the Best Cheesesteak Sandwich around! Order the large 20" sandwich for $12 it feeds 2 people or in my case just 1!! The Capistrami is unbelievably tasty! If you like sandwiches this about the best they get here in Vegas!!

REVIEW #78:  5 stars  (635 chars)
Probably the only fault of them is they don't have LATE LATE night hours and they're not RIGHT on the strip. ...  ... My recommendation is the Capistrami.  Get the large (20"), cut it in half (two 10" sandwiches) and share with somebody.  Nice bread... SUPER tasty pastrami... but the coleslaw on it is where it's at.  Good cold crunch that keeps you coming back for the next bite quicker than you thought you would. ...  ... Never really busy... a lot of locals order to go, so they just come in, pay, leave.  So plenty of seating for us out of towners. ...  ... It's in a VERY tiny strip mall near the corner of Sahara and The Strip.

REVIEW #79:  5 stars  (130 chars)
Sandwiches much better than subway! Great value and good options for vegetarians. Throughly enjoyed the veg cheese steak sandwich!

REVIEW #80:  5 stars  (84 chars)
Schneller, freundlicher Service. Preis/Leistung ist optimal. Guter Tipp fr sub-fans.

REVIEW #81:  5 stars  (259 chars)
SHIP THE BOBBIE all day long.  a place a lil far from everything but worth the drive.  love the portion size and the taste is amazing as well.  summer is coming along where i take my annual 2 month vegas trip and will be here soon!!! see ya soon capriottis!!!

REVIEW #82:  5 stars  (207 chars)
Should you find yourself on a vacation to Las vegas you must try Capriottis sandwich shop. It is a locals staple. They are located all over Vegas, and you must add it to your list of "to-do's" while there. I

REVIEW #83:  5 stars  (427 chars)
SO DELICIOUS!   ...  ... The Capistrami sandwich was excellent.  The Russian dressing was a delicious compliment to the sandwich, and the pastrami was super tasty (drool). ...  ... Our friend ordered the Bobbie (a "Thanksgiving" sandwich with turkey, cranberry sauce, and stuffing) which we each took a bite of - it tastes like Thanksgiving in one bite. ...  ... This will definitely be a place we frequent when we're in Vegas!

REVIEW #84:  5 stars  (235 chars)
Sometimes Im not feeling the whole faux meat thing... my standard order is the veggie cheese-steak (sans the fake meat). Its a delicious juicy hot sub with all the peppers (sweet and hot, mushrooms, cheese, and lettuce/tomato. ... Yum!

REVIEW #85:  5 stars  (815 chars)
Subway? Quiznos? F* them!!! ...  ... Capriotti's is easily the BEST sandwich shop I have ever been too.  My favorite is definitely the Capstrami - a delish blend of thin cut lean pastrami, with cole slaw and russian dressing on a hoagie roll.  HOLY CRAP.   ...  ... I have yet to try the turkey with stuffing and cranberry sauce (its called the BOBBIE), but I hear that its sooooooo good.  I'm sure that I will have to try it on a weekend when the triptophan won't put me to sleep during work hours. ...  ... Word of advice - the 9" sandwhich is their smallest, and for a girl like me (I love to eat) its more than I can eat.  The large is enough for two people. ...  ... The only thing that I don't like about this place is their hours.  They close at 5pm?!?!?!?  What?!?  No sammies in the evening?!  That's CRAP!

REVIEW #86:  5 stars  (195 chars)
Super awesome staff, the manager there's a great guy. Kathryn's extremely nice and the whole crew hooked up some delicious sandwiches. Overall the way experience I've ever had at any Capriotti's.

REVIEW #87:  5 stars  (474 chars)
Take a break from the strip and get over here for lunch! Order the capastrami, it the Bobbie and enjoy some good eats.  ...  ... The Capastrami is lovely with it's warm pastrami, delicious Russian dressing, and crunchy cole slaw. The Bobbie is like thanksgiving in a sandwich and its awesome. I love the inclusion of stuffing because that's always my favorite part of Thanksgiving. The sandwiches run big with a medium being both my lunch and dinner. This place is on point.

REVIEW #88:  5 stars  (139 chars)
The best cheesesteaks I've had to date.  Steak is lean, juicy and peppery. Roll is perfect - nice crust with soft center. Highly recommend.

REVIEW #89:  5 stars  (107 chars)
THE BEST. A must stop when in the area. Quality ingredients and service! Wish they had shops where we live!

REVIEW #90:  5 stars  (477 chars)
The Bobbie is delicious!!!!! My boyfriend and I went there absolutely starving on our way out of town. Went based on the high reviews on Yelp. Together we polished off the 20 inch! It was HUGE, but so good we savored every bite. Service was great & gave us the mayo on the side & even extra cranberry sauce as well (cus I like it saucy!) So tasty! Awesome portions & quality. Pinks in Miami has a similar sandwich called "The Thanksgiving" which also has gravy. Both very good.

REVIEW #91:  5 stars  (90 chars)
The Bobbie. 'nuff said. (Although they SHOULD turn down the a/c for folks eating there...)

REVIEW #92:  5 stars  (376 chars)
The Capistrami sandwich here is absolutely delicious and worthy of a 5 star review.  Pastrami, coleslaw, Russian dressing, provolone cheese, and you can request grilled peppers to add a little kick.  For you LA folk, think the Oinkster pastrami multiplied times 10.  Great little spot and worthy of multiple repeat performances.  Thanks for the recommendation Dean and Sherri!

REVIEW #93:  5 stars  (643 chars)
The reason I went to this place is because of its five star rating on yelp,  and I was definitely not disappointed. I went for the medium chicken cheese steak and it was actually quite big. The chicken was really tasty, the peppers, onions and mushrooms were perfect, and the cheese just made everything that much better.  ...  ... The service was good, there was no line when I walked in for lunch, and I waited about 10 minutes for the sandwich to be prepared. There is parking on site so its easy to get to and eat there.  ...  ... I don't know how to express how good my sandwich is but I'd really like another one right now if that helps.

REVIEW #94:  5 stars  (203 chars)
The soft drink cup says "Voted best sandwich in America." ... While eating the absolutely amazing home cooked turkey sandwich with every bite I took, I pondered about that statement. It probably is true.

REVIEW #95:  5 stars  (996 chars)
This is Las Vegas's best local sub shop chain hands down. In fact I will go as far as saying that they are like the In n Out Burger of Sub shops and that my friends is a judgement i only bestow on the very best. They are all over the place but this location is special to me because I used to live nearby when I first moved to this city and I would visit them for subs around 4x a week. Also they happen to have an old signed photo from Joe Biden hanging in the shop and its nice to know the Vice President loves Capriottis just as much as his constituents! Everything served here is great and quite unique, go nuts and try something new and different you wont be disappointed. Beware though the Large sized Sub is something like 24" and every time I take an out of towner there they instinctively order large like they always do anywhere else and to their surprise they get this monstrosity of a sub. Go here often or be ridiculed by those who don't understand your lack of subsational cravings!

REVIEW #96:  5 stars  (549 chars)
This is our one must stop food place in Vegas every time we come out. ...  ... We always get the Capastrami sandwich, which is by far, the most delicious pastrami sandwich you'll have!  ...  ... My other favorite, which actually I may like more than the pastrami even, is the Bobbie. It's like Thanksgiving Heaven in a sandwich!!  ...  ... The sandwiches are made to order, and always fresh and tasty. The prices are pretty good too. ...  ... I'd like to try other stuff on the menu, but we can never seem to not order the Capastrami and the Bobbie!

REVIEW #97:  5 stars  (1938 chars)
This is the best sub shop's (in Las Vegas, from back east) now-chain, but this is where it all started. When I first heard about this Bobbie sandwich- turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce, and mayo on a sub roll- I couldn't really imagine it tasting good, but my co-worker assured me that it was delicious. Ok, I took a chance and it was so good! I was hooked. It's like Thanksgiving in a sandwich. (This is funny because they say that imitation is the best form of flattery. We now make sandwiches like the Bobbie, with our Thanksgiving leftovers.) ...  ... Through the years, I've tried the cheese steak (yum), the grilled italian (hot sub- one of my husband's favorites), the cran slam club (least favorite) and the capastrami (pastrami, swiss cheese, russian dressing, & cole slaw- trust me- ok, a warning here, it's messy)- now my absolute favorite sub sandwich here.  ...  ... The counter is super high (for me anyway) so you can't really see, but once, when my sandwich was being prepared, I noticed that the turkey was weighed on a scale. The bread is really good, the meat is really good too, and the rest of the ingredients are high-quality. The sandwiches are broken down to the following categories: cap's specials, sandwiches, vegetarian, cold subs, & hot subs. Some of the chips selections are from back east (wise).  ...  ... Also, the sizes are: Small- 9", Medium- 12", & Large- 20". Prices range from $6.50 - $12.50 for most of the subs (Do not even compare this place to Subway's $5 footlong- it's in a totally different class of its own). I usually eat half, save half. Tip: If you get the large one, you can have three meals. The nice change (recently) about this restaurant are the weekend hours: Sat- 10-8, Sun-11-7. Also, there are so many locations due to the popularity that chances are there's one in your neighborhood, if you're local. If you're not, this is one of the places you need to try, when you're in town.

REVIEW #98:  5 stars  (216 chars)
This isn't my usual Capriotti's location but I was driving by and decided to stop.  I ordered my usual turkey sandwich with extra pickles.  The guys working here were very friendly.  I recommend this place to anyone.

REVIEW #99:  5 stars  (434 chars)
This place has awesome sandwiches!  I have tried the Capastrami, the Bobbie, the Slaw BeJo and the Cole Turkey.  My favorite so far is the CAPASTRAMI which is what I recommend you try first.  They're always friendly and greet everyone when they walk in and you can even get $3 off your order when you complete the online survey, which only takes a few minutes.  Overall...this place rocks and I'm goin to get some more Capastami soon!

REVIEW #100:  5 stars  (840 chars)
this place has been voted by lv review journal readers as the best sandwich year after year. ...  ... i've eaten at nearly every location in las vegas and would say without a doubt they are the best.  ...  ... My wife loves this place so much one time she bit into a hair-tie in the middle of a sandwich-spit it out and kept on chowing down. ...  ... The Capistrami & Bobbie are my favorites. ...  ... The capistrami is hot pastrami with their special cole slaw & russian dressing on a fresh roll 12 or 20 inch ... .  ... The bobbie is a thanksgiving delight. everything on a roll. turkey,stuffing and cranberry sauce with or without mayo!! ...  ... the service is always fast & friendly. the atmosphere is that of a small-town deli/sandwich shoppe and the food is always consistent & great. a little more $$ than others but always worth it

REVIEW #101:  5 stars  (531 chars)
This place is absolutely awesome. That it is a chain makes it all the more remarkable. ...  ... The Cran-Slam Club is like a little -- no, pretty good size -- piece of Thanksgiving year-round. ...  ... This particular location looks sketchy from the outside as mentioned by others, but it is just fine on the inside. ...  ... If you're in town at the north end of the Strip and you can get away for a lunch, do it. This is far better than they are hiding in the casinos and you can get a size-able sandwich and drink for under $10.

REVIEW #102:  5 stars  (587 chars)
This place is excellent!  I ordered the 9" Bobbie.  It was amazing.....like Thanksgiving in a sandwich.  The sandwich came wrapped in butcher paper and it was huge.  It is about $6.50 but I literally got 2 meals out of it.   ...  ... The wait was kind of long but that was only because so many people were there.....always a good sign.  It is definitely worth the wait!   ...  ... I walked from the LV Hilton which did take a while and the walk is kind of boring since it is a couple of blocks off the strip but it was a beautiful day out, so why not?   ...  ... This place is fantastic!

REVIEW #103:  5 stars  (595 chars)
This place served me one of the best sandwiches I have had in my entire life, and that is not an exaggeration. Everything about it was great. The ingredients were top notch and the taste was sooooo good! My mom and I ordered the Capastrami sandwich, which was delicious, but my dad had the Italian and my brother had the Cheese Steak and they loved those as well. ...  ... I highly recommend coming here if you are in Vegas! This particular location is a short drive down the strip, and there is a free parking lot. I can't wait to visit one of their Los Angeles locations (that's where I live).

REVIEW #104:  5 stars  (557 chars)
This sandwich shop deserves a 5! Didn't know about this place until a friend of mine brought back some sandwiches to our hotel. Drunk and hungry...I decided to take half of the Bobbie sub. WOW.....it was Thanksgiving in my mouth! So delicious! Homemade turkey, cranberry sauce, and stuffing all blended in so well. I had the Capistrami sandwich which was also delicious!  ...  ... Capriotti's is a must when we head out to Vegas. Highly recomended! Blow your mind by having the Bobbie or Capistrami before you try other sandwiches. You wont be dissapointed.

REVIEW #105:  5 stars  (249 chars)
This was possibly the best Italian sub that I have ever had. We found this place using Yelp on the iPhone while we were in Vegas and were not disappointed. I highly recommend that you grab a sandwich here if you are up on the north end of the Strip.

REVIEW #106:  5 stars  (1010 chars)
Um... best sandwich ever? ...  ... Capriotti's in Vegas is located on Sahara Ave.  I never would've thought about coming here unless I stayed near this part of the strip.  What to get here?  I loved the Capastrami, which is pastrami, coleslaw, and Russian dressing.  Amazing Russian dressing, one of the best ever.   ...  ... I tried a bit of my friend's Homemade Turkey with crushed pepper.  That crushed pepper totally made the sandwich and I actually requested some on the side for my own sandwich.  Add that crushed pepper to any sandwich, and it'll bring it to a whole different level.  Addicting! ...  ... Roast beef is incredibly flavorful.  We went back the next day and I got the Cheesesteak.  It's legit as well with thin sliced beef and great provolone.  As for hot peppers and request the crush peppers on the side to add on.  Guarantee the last bite is as good as the first. ...  ... I'm so obsessed with this place, I made up my mind to visit the location back in LA cause it's just so damn good!

REVIEW #107:  5 stars  (289 chars)
Unbelievable sandwiches! Tried their world famous Bobbie & Capistrami subs and both were outstanding! Heard a rumor that they're opening a location in San Diego in the very near future... Give this place a try if you're not yet familiar with the Capriotti sandwich shops, they're the BEST!

REVIEW #108:  5 stars  (1062 chars)
Vegas standard for sandwiches. Really. ...  ... It's tough to beat the Bobbie and the grilled Italian. The Bobbie is pretty much the go-to for most people. The Thanksgiving-in-a-sandwich experience. It's so good! Carb-filled heaven. Fresh turkey, cranberry sauce, and stuffing. Yes, meat, bread, sugar, and bread. And the grilled Italian. All the bad sliced meats from Italy in one sandwich, made crispy over the grill. Spicy on command. ...  ... And their bread - it's that certain chewy but not too much volume thing they have going on. It just works. And every time you go, you always want to order a bigger size for no reason at all other than just to do it. You'll even try to justify it. "What if I get hungry in a couple hours? What about dinner? Sudden meteor threats could make me stress eat and I could use the 20-incher." ...  ... They even have some vegetarian meat options. This is pretty cool and unexpected, especially for a Vegas spot. This isn't exactly a vegan/vegetarian city so it's nice to see a popular place take the initiative. I'm a fan.

REVIEW #109:  5 stars  (164 chars)
Veggie cheese steak is soooo delicious!!! They just opened one in Concord, not too far from my current location.  Looking forward to trying their veggie sandwiches.

REVIEW #110:  5 stars  (42 chars)
Veggie turkey sandwich... Best thing ever!

REVIEW #111:  5 stars  (557 chars)
Very very good. Me and my group of 3 got two 20 inch subs. One was sausage and the other was the Italian. I preferred the sausage but both were very good.  I picked them up and then walked back to my hotel, so they werent piping hot, but that is hardly their fault. The staff was friendly my group got there right before they closed and they still made our food and didnt make you feel bad about it. I would have liked to tried the meatball sub, but they were out of meatballs. There are a few other things i would have liked to try but i live out of state.

REVIEW #112:  5 stars  (239 chars)
We are never disappointed when we come here.  We just shared the Capastrami...amazing!!! I'm working up the nerve to order the Bobby, I've heArd it's amazing, I'm just not a huge fan of cranberry. Capriotti's is a MUST when we visit Vegas.

REVIEW #113:  5 stars  (361 chars)
Well, just add me to the list of fans of a wonderful "unique" sandwich shop. When I went to the Sahara location (on a Monday when it opened), I had no problem with parking and there were very few customers inside. The staff was extremely helpful and the shop was very clean. I new I was In a good place when one of the customers odered 18 sandwiches!!!...lol...

REVIEW #114:  5 stars  (548 chars)
what can I say that hasn't been said already about Capriotti's? Don't think I've had a bad sandwich yet. My favorites are the Bobbie and the grilled italian. ...  ... If I had to criticize anything it would be that the roast beef. While it has great flavor it is always so dry.  ...  ... Staff is always very friendly at this location. Love that we can order online from work and have it ready to pick up. Saves time and easy to do.  ...  ... Suggestions for Capriotti's: different sub rolls (or at least wheat) and some more sandwich combinations.

REVIEW #115:  5 stars  (418 chars)
YUM YUM YUM YUM YUM!!!!! ... I'm not even from Vegas and I heard about Capriotti's since it's famous amoung the locals. Now I can see (and taste) why! I loved LOVED my mushroom cheesesteak with grilled onions and peppers! Soooo freakin' good!  ... I just wish they had one here in the Bay Area, specifically somewhere across the street from my job.... ... Damn I'm craving Capriotti's right now as I write this review!

REVIEW #116:  4 stars  (1041 chars)
4.5 for me. the bobbie and capastrami are freakin awesome! my friend and i split two 12 inchers, no pun intended, and we decided on those sammiches, mmmmmmmmmmmm!!! ...  ... i tried the capastrami second, but i'm saving the best for last: this was delish! serious party in my mouth. the hot pastrami, swiss cheese, cole slaw and russian dressing, omgosh! really great flavors, your taste buds won't hate you for this one. i just wish that maybe they toasted their bread a bit?! i dunno, i like it the way it is, but i think a hot bun would make it even better. ...  ... now onto the bobbie: hot damn! whoever thought of putting thanksgiving  dinner in a sammich?!?! so delish! who gives a fcuk if you're on a diet or one of those low carb shits, this sammich will make you change your mind about going low card ever again. ...  ... warning: it is vegas, you might end up putting all this in the toilet, the way it came in. at least it's got the cranberry so it has pretty colors for you to stare at and regret how much you've had to drink!!!

REVIEW #117:  4 stars  (867 chars)
[this is re-post--another review lost to the Yelp algorithm, I suppose] ...  ... On the recommendation of Yelper Michelle T, I trekked from my South Las Vegas Blvd. hotel to get a sub at Capriotti's.  Imagine my surprise when I learned that the chain originated close to my hometown, just minutes from where my father worked for years! ...  ... I took Michelle's recommendations, got a Bobbie and a Capistrami and met my SO for lunch at the location of his conference.  Both sandwiches were great (though nothing will ever surpass the pastrami at Langer's in LA).  The Bobbie was especially fun and different, with all the elements of a good Thanksgiving meal in portable sandwich form. ...  ... I might have to check out the original back in Delaware next time I visit family. Alas, we have no Capriotti's in Colorado, so I have to travel for that sandwich goodness.

REVIEW #118:  4 stars  (119 chars)
About $8 a sandwich.  A little out of the way.  The philly cheese steak was good.  As always, I threw in peppers.  Yum.

REVIEW #119:  4 stars  (1099 chars)
After walking around in the Premium Outlet in the morning, my family and I decided to eat something for lunch.  Sick and tired of all the buffets, we decided to eat something different.  Since we are staying in Springhill Suite close to convention center, we found this place which has a very high rating.  My wife ordered the capastrami, and I order the Be Jo and Bobbie.  Be Jo I think is okay.  the roast beef was a bit dry when you eat it.   ...  ... My wife love the capastrami.  she think the combination of the pasrami along with cole slaw and dressing is just great.  She is not a great fan of turkey stuffing and cranberry, so she is not too found of the Bobbie.  On the other hand, I do enjoy that sweet taste in Bobbie.  I have to say this is a true original concept.  haven't had similar sandwich in other places.  The strange part (not sure if is on purpose) the filling is cold ..... that just simply add more flavor to the sandwich for me.   ...    ... this is definitely a place I would try next time again when I need to get away from buffet.  and I DO NEED to get away from Buffet.

REVIEW #120:  4 stars  (255 chars)
Always VERY good never great. I would still go 4.2 stars:) The highlights being the phlliy cheesteak as far as the sandwiches are concerned. But the devil is in the details, i.e. the WISE brand chips they carry, specifically the sea salt and vinegar ones!

REVIEW #121:  4 stars  (246 chars)
By far, the best sandwiches I've ever had. I find myself craving these sandwiches about once a week, but I don't live in Vegas so I plan Vegas trips just to go and eat here. just kidding.  ...  ... One word.... "Capristrami"  ...  ... Go get one!

REVIEW #122:  4 stars  (609 chars)
CAPASTRAMI! DO IT, DO IT! this sandwich was all i hoped for after reading the rave reviews from the yelpers. Tasty loads of pastrami nestled in a perfect bun by itself would be just fine for me. BUT, they through a heaping helping of coleslaw on top and it becomes decadence in your hand. I loved it. Unfortunately my wife got the cole turkey and hated it. I tasted it and it just tasted like tuna salad to me, not my fav.  ... CAPASTRAMI is the way to go for sure, i'll be back next time i roll through Vegas for sure.  ...  ... PS..I do hate when restaurants don't have fountain drinks, it's cheap and lame.

REVIEW #123:  4 stars  (166 chars)
Capastrami....very, very good, comes with homemade slaw and Russian dressing. Small is plenty for one...almost 8 bucks. They don't have fountain drinks, only bottled.

REVIEW #124:  4 stars  (844 chars)
Capriotti's is a very good sandwich place. It is located just off the strip, one block west on Sahara. They have very good sandwiches for a decent price. My friends and I decided to pick several sandwiches up and eat in the room since we wanted ample time to get ready for a big night clubbing. I even bought an extra one for a post drinking meal. I ordered: ...  ... Capastrami: A pastrami sandiwch served with cole slaw, swiss cheese, and Russian dressing. It was very good. The pastrami was lean and not too salty. It was very good. ...  ... The Bobbie: A turkey sandwich served with cranberry sauce and stuffing. It was delicious.  ...  ... The sandwiches here are great! It's a good place for a quick cheap meal in Las Vegas. You can easy take it back to your room. They serve comparable sandwiches to Earl of Sandwich in Planet Hollywood.

REVIEW #125:  4 stars  (106 chars)
Cran-slam club, very different! Turkey is delish... the bread was really soft and I enjoyed it. tRY IT! =)

REVIEW #126:  4 stars  (697 chars)
Duuuude this place rocked my sandwich world! I ordered the capastrami - hot pastrami, coleslaw, melted swiss cheese, russian dressing. The hubby got the bobbie - homemade turkey, cranberry, stuffing and mayo. My capastrami was so tasty...who knew that coleslaw in your sandwich made everything that much better? The bobbie really did remind me of thanksgiving dinner...good and very comforting. The bread also deserves to be mentioned...soft...mmmmm. I went to the location in Red Rock Casino and after a day of swimming in the pool this dinner gave me strength for the long night ahead. ...  ... fyi...so many awards - they are zagat rated, best in LV 2008, best inexpensive meal by Frommers etc.

REVIEW #127:  4 stars  (1277 chars)
Enourmous hot and cold sub sammies with a few original creations. Subway and blimpie beware, the Capriottis chain puts you to shame. Their signature sub, the Bobbie is basically Thanksgiving on a hero, freshly in house roasted slabs of carved turkey slathered with homemade stuffing, jellied cranberry sauce and mayo. Both a mess of a dish and one of lifes great guilty pleasures. The Capistrami is loaded with lean hot pastrami, sweet coleslaw, melted cheese and slathered in a robust 1,000 dressing and nicknamed the "shirt killer" as this monstrous hero has ruined many shirts, I'm sure. A lesser known hero and my personal favorite is thr hot italian, a plethora of salamis, hams and other pork products grilled hot the regrilled on the roll, with melted swiss or provolone and roasted sweet and hot peppers. The high grade ham crisps up on the edges and the heat of the meats releases just the right amount of greasy juices that mingle with the sweet and spicty tang of the roasted peppers and the bite of pepper and seasoning in one of te cured salamis makes a heavenly combination.... Alas, there are no Capriotti's near me anymore, though in reality that alone will probably save a year or two of my life. Definitely not for the calorically challenged people out there.

REVIEW #130:  4 stars  (93 chars)
Great place to get a sandwich. I love Capastrami here. It's an amazing balance with the slaw.

REVIEW #131:  4 stars  (60 chars)
Great subs. That have great flavor from the very first bite.

REVIEW #132:  4 stars  (609 chars)
I found this place while perusing Yelp for a place to eat that was within walking distance of the hotel. After reading the overwhelmingly positive reviews, I had to try it... and I was not disappointed. ...  ... I ordered "The Bobbie" which is essentially Thanksgiving leftovers on a sub -- Turkey, Cranberry Sauce, Stuffing, and Mayo. It immediately brought me back to the day after Thanksgiving. A sandwich that is classic, but absolutely delicious. ...  ... Service can be a little slow if there's an influx of customers, but not a deal-breaker. A great sandwich shop that I look forward to visiting again.

REVIEW #133:  4 stars  (224 chars)
I live in Hawaii and whenever I go to the mainland I have to hit up Capriotti's for a Capastrami.  Service was great.  The Capastrami was great.  This is not the usual location I go to in Las Vegas, but it worked out for me.

REVIEW #134:  4 stars  (777 chars)
i long to go back to vegas just for the pastrami !! this place is delcious! ...  ... The Bobbie: it is delicious and taste like a fresh sandwich should! very good and worth every penny ... The capastrami: the best pastrami sandwhich i have ever had, the meat is not too salty ,and its flavored just right to be deliciously delicious! cant go wrogn with this thng!! ...  ... the restaurant: its alright, i dont like eating here too much, its just too much hassle for me, i like it even though its clean and all, but it gets busy really quick. ...  ... the service: ... nice people, but i will say that they take a good while on your sandwich whether its busy or not, come hungry but dont expect to eat for a good 15 minutes when you walk in here.  ...  ... a must have in vegas!

REVIEW #135:  4 stars  (262 chars)
I love this place. I tried it after reading all the posting on YELP!. I was looking for a place I can eat at off the Vegas strip. Their sandwiches are amazing. If you are in the area, you should really check them out. It was worth the 2 mile walk in the HOT sun!

REVIEW #136:  4 stars  (701 chars)
I stopped into Capriotti's yesterday after reading dozens of enthusiastic reviews. I decided to get a 9" Bobbie with hot mustard and a 9" meatball with American cheese and fried onions to go. Ten minutes later, I was back out on the street with two handsomely wrapped sandwiches and an orange crush.  ...  ... Needless to say, they did not disappoint! I personally preferred the Bobbie over the meatball--the turkey is extraordinarily well-prepared. The meatball was a contender, but I like a bit more garlic and zest in the sauce. Nonetheless, I'll order it again, especially considering its convenient location off the Strip. On a happy side note, Capriotti's stocks Herr's ketchup chips by the bag!

REVIEW #137:  4 stars  (247 chars)
I was in Las Vegas for 5 days on business and had a hard time finding good restaurants, reasonably priced around town.  The sandwiches are fresh, tasty and plenty of vegetarian options.  Service was friendly and helpful.  Would definitely go back.

REVIEW #138:  4 stars  (807 chars)
I'm a fan because of the sheer size of their sandwiches!  One can easily feed 2 people for lunch.  And the associate or manager let us keep the sandwich that the other worker messed up on and apologized.   ...  ... What I had: the Italian sausage, SlawBeJo, and the Italian ... *Italian sausage- with bell peppers and melted cheese and side of marinara. Yum. ... *SlawBeJo- not as great..plenty of coleslaw, hint of meat..not satisfying to my palate.  A lot of sauce from the coleslaw. ... *Italian- and I must say, I'd definitely order the Italian again!  The fixings and blend of onion and seasonings that went on ALL sandwiches went incredibly well with the meats of the Italian.  Sooo good. ...  ... BTW, sandwiches especially ones with coleslaw, probably aren't good next day. No one likes soggy bread.

REVIEW #139:  4 stars  (853 chars)
I've been wanting to try the Bobbie ever since I saw it on TV. So I was in Vegas and looking for something to eat that was not on the strip. I like Earl's but I've been there. They have more than one Capriotti location and it was my chance! ...  ... The Bobbie is Thanksgiving in a sandwich. You know the day after Thanksgiving when you stuff the turkey, cranberry sauce and stuffing all into a sandwich and it so so good. Well, the Bobbie is like that all year long. I liked the sandwich but I am not a fan of a huge amount of bread. If there was a bit less bun it would have been PERFECT. The stuffing was delicious. If you don't like sweet in your sandwich it would have been perfect.  ...  ... My husband had the grilled Italian. It was spicy, meaty and delicious. ...  ... The staff was friendly and they really need a Southern California location.

REVIEW #140:  4 stars  (679 chars)
If I were only reviewing my sandwich, it would be five stars.  If it were only about my husband's sandwich, it would be three stars. ...  ... I got the capastrami, and it was WONDERFUL! A warm sandwich with a perfect combination of pastrami, swiss cheese, coleslaw, and Russian dressing.  Every taste came out, the warmth was perfect, the bread soft.  I really enjoyed this sandwich. ...  ... My husband ordered the Bobbie, which is very highly rated, but it was a bit flat.  Not a lot of flavor.  And it was cold.  And a little dry.  Perhaps if it was warmed up it would have been a little better. ...  ... So...if you're in the mood for a pastrami sandwich, this is the place!!

REVIEW #141:  4 stars  (754 chars)
If you're in Vegas and you're strapped for cash, this is the place to go. ...  ... For about $10 bucks, you can get a hearty meal just as delicious as anywhere to satisfy your grumbling stomach.  Never a line when I come to this awesome place. ...  ... I'm not a huge fan of their famous Bobbie, but it's still a solid sub that tastes just like they describe it. ...  ... But the way to go is Capastrami all the way.   ... Their mountain of delicious hot pastrami and coleslaw speaks to the soul.  No other Capriotti's I've been to give as generous portions like this one.  This is the best Capriotti's I've been to. ...  ... Waiting time (for making the food): 5min @ 2:00 pm Saturday ... Service: 10/10 ... Cost with tax (no tip): About $10 per person.

REVIEW #142:  4 stars  (467 chars)
Ive had the most popular bobby, I didnt like it. It has all the components I liked, excited, but it didnt taste good. I ate my boyfriends cheese steak instead with the added onion,  mushroom, and jalepano. It was tasty. They have three different sizes. They can come pretty large so perfect to share. We have over our many visit also tried the meatball sub but the best is still the philly. The staff is really nice, service was quick, will definitely be coming back.

REVIEW #143:  4 stars  (253 chars)
Locally owned and operated chain of Vegas sub shops. Great value amazing menu. Good assortement of Vegan Vegetarian and Carivore type sandwiches. The Bobbie is their signature sandwich and is a must try. Next time I am in town I will be back many times.

REVIEW #144:  4 stars  (523 chars)
Located just west of Las Vegas Blvd on Sahara near the Red Label Lounge, this Capriotti's location is easily accessible from the strip. The shopping plaza that it sits inside of might make you raise an eyebrow, but it's actually a pretty nice nice place inside and the staff is all all very friendly. ...  ...  They have vegetarian offerings on the menu that don't feel like a meat sandwich minus the meat (the vegetarian cheese steak is my favorite) so it's quickly become my favorite place to grab a quick bite for lunch.

REVIEW #145:  4 stars  (534 chars)
Mmmm, this sandwich place was the business, especially post-hangover, and my last meal before hitting the road.   I got their roast beef sandwich with all the fixings, and I must say that usually I'm not a coleslaw fan but it definitely was super good in this sandwich. ...  ... Service was also super polite and the lady at the counter was polite enough to give us some suggestions since it was our first time there.  Too bad they don't have any locations in N.Cal, I'll have to wait again to have another of these tasty concoctions!

REVIEW #146:  4 stars  (185 chars)
Must order their Capastrami.  Very good price for the size of a 20" pastrami mixed with coleslaw sandwiches. I also tried their turkey sandwiches, but pastrami is still my favorite!!!!!

REVIEW #147:  4 stars  (298 chars)
NOMNOMNOM!!!! WOW what a great sandwich! Loved the turkey with cranberry sauce. yummy! These places are a chain and they are all over town, but the food and concept are holding up. The sandwiches are big and there are a few chairs sometimes in these places. Not fancy at all but really really good!

REVIEW #148:  4 stars  (492 chars)
Oh yes I am a fan!!! ... Great to grab on your way to the airport for a snack on the plane! ... Service was solid and fast.  ... I had the Bobbie and my mom ordered the Capastrami. Check out the menu online! ... Both were delish and the bread...oh sweet baby jesus it was crusty chewy and hearty enough to handle all the fixin inside! ... We dont have a Capriotti's in our neck of the woods so I look forward to going back. ...  ... winnah winnah chicken dinnah (shaking my shakka in the air)

REVIEW #149:  4 stars  (149 chars)
Pretty good sandwiches. Large sandwiches.  ... Would say earl of sandwiches is better.  ... Cheese steak tastes similar to philly. Capastrami is good

REVIEW #150:  4 stars  (799 chars)
Sitting here back at my desk in LA, makes me a bit sad with no easy access to Capriottis.  ...  ... We were searching thru yelp to where to go for lunch, and this came up. A Vegas resident said this place was the shit... and hey it was right by the hotel so why not!  ...  ... After my visit to Capriottis, all I can say is that I want more! Very yum to the Capistrami, like usual, I got a bit greedy and got the medium. I was full after the first half but didn't want it to go to waste cause it tasted so good! It was a perfect blend of warm pastrami and the cold Cole slaw inside of a fresh tasting roll.  ...  ... My friend got the Bobbie, said it was good but she'd def like it more if they warmed up the sandwich.  ...  ... This place is definitely one to add to my go to list while in Vegas :P

REVIEW #151:  4 stars  (1082 chars)
Small, medium, and large are definitely American-sized portions (9", 12", and 20", respectively). I had a small over the course of two meals. The large looked intimidating as the guys behind the counter were wrapping one up for a delivery order. ...  ... We visited Capriotti's twice during our four-day stint in Vegas and tried the grilled Italian, Philly cheese steak, and the Bobbie. I'm a big fan of both hot sandwiches and melted cheese, so the Philly cheese steak was my favorite out of the three. It's also one of the better Philly cheese steaks I've had. ...  ... Each sandwich was between $6-8 (small and medium sizes). This was a welcome respite from shelling out two to three times more per person for a meal in this town. And the sandwiches were delicious and satisfying! Even the Bobbie, a cold sub, was a delight to munch on since it's basically a lot of Thanksgiving crammed between two halves of a baguette. ...  ... The verdict: If you want to give your wallet a break, but your taste buds crave more, head over to the closest Capriotti's and pig out for under $10.

REVIEW #152:  4 stars  (2180 chars)
So good we got an extra sandwich to go. ...  ... My fianc could live on sandwiches for the rest of his life and be a happy well fed fella. He's always on the look out for a new place and today he suggested Capriotti's with a certain eagerness in his eye. ...  ... Located next to the Golden Steer just off the strip (yet in a non-run down area) with plenty of parking. Capriotti's is a smallish restaurant with about 10  - 12 tables (depending on the arrangement). Since you can eat a sandwich fairly quickly or take it home, it's not really an issue. Plenty of seats were to be found when we were there. ...  ... I ordered the Italian Meatball and he ordered the Turkey sandwich. Like most couples we took a bit of each other's sandwich. While not a big turkey fan, I have to say it was really put together well. REAL turkey with chucks of meat and not the pressed deli meat you'll find in a sandwich vending machine. With plenty of condiments mixed with a nice mixture of spices made for great turkey sandwich. ...  ... I ordered the Meatball and consider it one of the best I've ever eaten. The  bread was soft enough to allow the cheese and tomato sauce to mix together so you get that delicious tomato, meat, cheese, bread paste in your mouth.  ...  ... Many places will serve it to you with a hard shell of a sandwich leaving you with a soggy inside and a impenetrable crust capable of chipping a tooth. Luckily you won't find such a monstrosity here. ...  ... The staff was very friendly and didn't blink an eye when we asked for condiments. They even suggested some options they thought would go create with the sandwich. ...  ... At the end, we enjoyed our individual sandwiches so much we ordered the famous "Bobbi" to go for dinner that night. Despite being 6 hours old and sitting in a car for a while, it was still very tasty. I only imagine how much better it tastes fresh or after taking it home. ...  ... If dollar value matters, rest assured the prices are fair and the smallest sandwich is 9 inches long which should satisfy anyone.  ...  ... So if you love sandwiches, go to Capriotti's for a great deal and probably the best sandwich you've had in a long time.

REVIEW #153:  4 stars  (592 chars)
The Capastrami was amazing. Probably the best submarine I had ever eaten in my life. Seriously. I came back the next day & got the Boobie. Not impressed with that one. Too much dry stuffing. They should use mashed potatoes & gravy instead of stuffing.  ...   Lil side story. The chick taking the order starts flirting from the second I walk in. She tells me shes getting off in 5min & she'll b at the bar next door. I tell her I got a show to go to but got her #. She wanted to "hang", but had to find a baby sitter. She was way older than me & looked like an alchy. Lol "They're all whores"!

REVIEW #154:  4 stars  (249 chars)
The sandwiches here are delicious. Anything with turkey is going to be amazing. Of course if you want an amazing gluttonous experience, try the Bobbie sandwich. Turkey, Stuffing, Cranberry sauce on a roll. It sounds really gross, but it's delicious!

REVIEW #155:  4 stars  (350 chars)
The service here was great and the workers were very friendly and helpful. I split the medium Bobbie and medium capastrami with my friend, Pamela S. whose review is right below. They were very yummy and satisfying, needless to say it was a lot of food and I practically had a footlong leftover. The leftovers were great when I needed a drunken snack.

REVIEW #156:  4 stars  (165 chars)
The vegetarian options are really impressive.  There is a fake turkey and a veggie cheese steak which is pretty exciting! It's very tasty stuff but pretty salty too.

REVIEW #157:  4 stars  (320 chars)
This Capriotti's (on Sahara, near the strip) has been remodeled and now has longer hours, including being open on Sunday. ...  ... Finally!  ... Maybe they read my previous review.  ... Wait a minute....scratch that....they still don't make their own bread.  ... So they are still an angel's breath away from perfection.

REVIEW #158:  4 stars  (226 chars)
This is a great place to go especially on a lazy Sunday to grab food for a picnic! I can enjoy Thanksgiving dinner any time of the year thanks to the Bobbie! Even when I dine in I forget that the location is not the best. lol!

REVIEW #159:  4 stars  (682 chars)
This place is on-poooooooooint.  Our first stop in Vegas before the Gold & Silver, was for food.  Even at 10:30 a.m., Cap-o's was husslin' and busslin'.  I had never been before, so it felt good to know that they had enough business to employ like 14 cooks at such an early hour.  They do a huge catering/to go business, but they also have a dine in area.  The restaurant is clean and comfortable.  This was the perfect start to our Vegas vacation. ...  ... The Capastrami is dope: Hot pastrami, Swiss cheese, Russian dressing and cold slaw.  Christina had the homemade turkey sandwich, I had a bite - delicious.  ...  ... You can't go wrong with this place.   ...  ... Out - Sixton

REVIEW #160:  4 stars  (526 chars)
This sandwich is what made this place famous and it's worth it to check it out. My Mom and brother all recommded this place when I moved back to LV 6 years ago. This Thanksgiving tasty sandwich filled with turkey that is cooked daily and then shredded down meets it's adverstised demand. I recommend to add lettuce and tomato and extra tomato as there is bread (the roll) on bread (the stuffing) action going on! The Capistrami is my second favorite very tasty with the Russian dressing gives a pastrami sandwich a nice twist.

REVIEW #161:  4 stars  (513 chars)
Walked there from signature suites at mgm. I love the sandwiches.. So far I have had the bobby, cheesesteak, and capristrami. Small is like a medium and medium like a large. The capistrami is delist but the coleslaw got a littlest ... Ty at the end. I would order it on the side next time. The Bobby seemed like it needed more mayo.otherwise tasted great.i love how all the sauce, meat stayed in the bun bc of the cool rolls.. cheesteak was tasty. Finished the medium there, wished the steak was a little thinner.

REVIEW #162:  4 stars  (277 chars)
We had about 3 different sandwiches... from what i remember they were all pretty good! Pretty cheap and a sandwich can feed like 5! I think my favorite was the Bobbie, it had like cranberry sauce of some sort. The Capastrami sandwich, and cole turkey was also pretty delicious.

REVIEW #163:  4 stars  (2407 chars)
We were hungry and lazy to leave the office. It was a Thursday, the longest day of the week, and we wanted good food--fast. A coworker of mine suggested a sandwich place literally around the corner from Industrial Road called Capriotti's. Apparently the food there is divine and I had to try it. Falling for another suggestion of great food, and seeing on the internet it was also listed as The Best of Las Vegas a couple years in a row (like all the other restaurants here), I gave it a chance. ...  ... My supervisor suggested "The Bobbie", a trademarked sammie from this shop. I took the suggestion, and about fifteen minutes later the cold sub came to my desk. It was nicely wrapped in traditional butcher paper, and a fast handwritten "Bobbie No Mayo" skewed the front. I ripped the tape, unrolled the culinary package and saw a great sandwich. Nay--a beauty. I am a person in love with Thanksgiving all year round, and this sandwich combined a Thanksgiving dinner in a roll. A large roll to be exact. The turkey was shredded and a great portion was given for meat. I could see the purplish-red cranberry sauce with whole cranberries along the entire thing, and a great topping--stuffing--crammed on top. ...  ... The first bite was heavenly, a beautiful flip of my hungry tastebuds and mind. I must say that this sandwich is--without exxargerating--a beautiful symphony of comfort food with the addition of bread to hold it all. The stuffing was fantastic, although clearly boxed, nicely done. The turkey, although somewhat dry in some parts, was juiced up by a great hint of cranberry sauce inbetween. ...  ... The twelve inches did not survive, and I almost fell asleep an hour later. ...  ... Most sandwiches require a side dish of chips or potato salad of some sort, yet this particular sammy from Capriotti's needed nothing but itself. That evening, I had to share the discovery with my spouse, who happily agreed after a twelve inch that this place is worth waiting in line for. The best part of the shop itself is that they sell Tastykakes--a beautiful junk dessert creation that I adore. ...  ... If you love great sandwiches, try Capriotti's in Vegas or anywhere in the U.S. for that matter. Since they have the honor of being first on my critique, and because their taste in sandwiches literally rocked my world to a whole new level, I give them the fantastic, personal rating: ...  ... 5/5!

REVIEW #164:  4 stars  (347 chars)
Went here for the first time and got the Bobbie sandwich (turkey, stuffing and cranberry). Thanksgiving in July! It was really good. The place is cute, clean and the staff really friendly. We've heard from friends that this place was really good, and were not disappointed. Will definitely come again and try more of the yummy sounding sandwiches.

REVIEW #165:  4 stars  (242 chars)
What I got: 12" Cheesesteak with extra peppers ...  ... Pros: the sandwich was great. The mixture of cheese, peppers and steak worked well together. ...  ... Cons: the beef steak was a tad bit dry. The cheese made up for the lack of moisture.

REVIEW #166:  3 stars  (1036 chars)
Another place I pass by on my walk and I have seen thier ads in several publications saying they were voted #1 in Las Vegas for thier "Bobbie" = a Turkey, cranberry & dressing sandwhich.....I passed on that & opted for a 9 inch Italian on wheat and was told they only had white bread, so I went with it. I just got the sandwhich, no drink or chips & the total came to $7.12 which I thought was a little steep considering the lunch buffet at Main St Casino is $9. ...  ...  For the amount of people behind the counter & the amount of customers in the place it took awhile to get my order = I looked at the LV WEEKLY Magazine all the way through & the order still wasnt ready. NBD as I really wasnt in a hurry. ...  ... The sandwhich was OK and had alot of meat on it compared to a Subway sub. I guess haveing been in Miami and a rocks throw from Casola's I got a little spoiled when it comes to portion, quality & Value bang for your buck. ...  ... It is what it is & I'll probably go back again & try another type sub one of these days.

REVIEW #167:  3 stars  (586 chars)
Came here based on yelp recommendations.  It isn't on the strip but just off it, not a problem since we had a car. ...  ... I believe this place is a chain, not only once place.  There is a whole list of  sandwiches you can choose from. ...  ... We got the capitrami, cheese steak, tuna, bobbie.  They were all decent sandwiches, not your standard type.  ... Service was kind of slow, but the sandwiches were good.  Really great drunk food after a long night of drinking a well. ...  ... Not sure I'll make the trek out there again for sandwiches, but I'll definitely keep them in mind.

REVIEW #168:  3 stars  (275 chars)
Capriotti's served up a fair sandwich (philly cheese steak w/ everything...) I'd give them 4 stars - but things were a little disorganized and slow. Price is ok. I plan on going back and seeing if the slow service wasn't just a fluke. ...  ... Overall a decent sandwich shop.

REVIEW #169:  3 stars  (443 chars)
Cute lil joint. The lady who takes your order is loud but nice. Sodas are a bit pricey at $2.50 a can, but for 50cents more you can buy a beer! Ordered the egg salad, loud lady said it was a good choice, asked if I could add avacado on it and she said NO! Rude! After that the service was pretty non-existant and I wasn't the only patrom who noticed. They need to hire a little more help for the lunch rush! Next time I'll take my order to go.

REVIEW #170:  3 stars  (275 chars)
Decent flavor on my cheesesteak with mushrooms and cherry peppers.  Only thing that ruined it was they added A LOT of hot pepper extract (couldn't pinpoint which) but it made it way too spicy.  Got a good sweat out of it.  Nice and clean with friendly service.  I'll be back.

REVIEW #171:  3 stars  (1559 chars)
Decent sandwich shop with plenty of options. ...  ... My wife and I stopped by this place when were vacationing in Vegas last year.  Luckily for us, it was within walking distance from the Stratosphere where we were staying. ...  ... We had searched the reviews on Yelp and decided to give this place a try. ...  ... My wife ordered the 'Bobbie'; basically thanksgiving dinner stuffed within a loaf of bread.  Turkey, cranberry sauce, stuffing, and mayo. ...  ... I ordered the Cheese Steak with mushrooms and onions. ...  ... While both of our sandwiches were prepared well and served at a decent temperature, we both felt the same way about the food.  It was decent, but was missing some flavor in some places.  A little salt could have benefited both of our sandwiches. ...  ... While the bread itself was delicious and fresh, it was a bit of a chore gnawing through it.  The Bobbie my wife got could have benefited from being toasted. ...  ... While I feel the food falls inbetween 2 and 3 stars, I felt the need to give them 3 because the service was stellar.  The staff was very attentive and was very helpful despite the fact that we were probably the 85735739th out-of-town vacationing couple they'd served that day. ...  ... Apparently we came near a strange early closing time and the manager sent us off with a large bag of 6 whole loaves of their bread on the house!!!  We happily accepted these and they came in useful to snack on while in the hotel room. ...  ... We may return to try something else off the menu the next time we're in the area.

REVIEW #172:  3 stars  (526 chars)
I know it is almost anti Las Vegan of me but this is the first time I have had capriotti's.  It seems everyone I know has been and LOVEs it.   ...  ... So tis the season for turkey so I choose to have the Cran-Slam club with Turkey, Cranberry Sauce, Ham, Mayo and Lettuce made on sliced white or wheat bread.  I am not a big cranberry person and everything but that in this sandwich I enjoyed.  Lots of meat and no skimping or overdoing the veggies to make up for light meat. ...  ... I'll go back again to try another one. :)

REVIEW #173:  3 stars  (891 chars)
I wanted Italian and this shop came up on my search. After reading reviews I wanted a sandwich so... We were right next to it wasting $$ at the souvenir shop. Walked in about noon on a Wednesday not too busy. ... Ordered the Philly and the Capastrami. Waited about 20 minutes and food came out. WTHeck...They only made the Philly I wasn't charged for the Capastrami but they quickly acknowledged the mis-communication and made it w/out charge. Both sandwiches were warm. I enjoyed the Capastrami but I haven't been able to get into the east coast add coleslaw to sandwiches thing. I love a good coleslaw Capriottis was good. I would definitely have this again with coleslaw on the side. Very good pastrami. The Philly, I thought, was really good. Bread was nice, cheese was melted into meat and it was warm and quite tasty. We could only eat half and saved the other for the ride back to AZ.

REVIEW #174:  3 stars  (668 chars)
My friends and I were in a pinch to grab food and someone mentioned Capriottis, so I thought why not. ...  ... The location was far away from the strip in a street lot location. ...  ... Once inside, the seating area was luckily able to hold a party of 11. ...  ... The menu selection is quite small so I ordered the Slobby Joe (roast beef, cole slaw, regular bread roll) this sandwich  mainly consisted of cole slaw but after digging an inch of all that mayo drenched cabbage the roast beef had a great taste ...  ... After reading more views I realize that the choice of sandwich was probably a poor one and should've ordered the Bobbie or the turkey dinner sandwich

REVIEW #175:  3 stars  (73 chars)
No wheat bread option!!!  Other than that the sandwiches are pretty good.

REVIEW #176:  3 stars  (1225 chars)
Ohhh, I hate to be the anomaly but here we go: ...  ... I was really looking forward to this sandwich. I ordered the Bobbie because it sounded interesting and it's not like I can get this type of sandwich at Subway, right? Be warned (or elated), the sandwiches are HUGE.  ...  ... The Bobbie is a 'Thanksgiving Anytime' type of sandwich. It's pulled turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce and mayo. I don't know if it was just an off day or what, but my turkey was so DRY. I also didn't really care for the flavor of the sandwich. The bread was good though. My bf ordered the meatball sub which he said was just average.  ...  ... This place got crazy packed at lunch while we were there. All locals too. Always a good sign.  ...  ... A memorable side note- two high school kids sat next to us with their large Capastrami (to split). I was floored at the size of the sandwich and asked them if that was the large (20"). They said that they always get a large to split because it's cheaper and they get more food. They told me to order it next time: a Capastrami with chicken cheesesteak instead of pastrami. It looked fantastic.  ...  ... I haven't given up on this place. I plan on trying those kids' custom Capastrami next time.

REVIEW #177:  3 stars  (351 chars)
Really? 5 stars from everyone? I guess I knew people from Vegas didnt know what good food was, but whatever. I got the Italian, and it was just alright. Something I could have made at my own home if I had the will to buy all those different meats. I was the only person in there and for some reason It still took them over 20 mins to make my sandwich.

The good: ... Sandwiches are outstanding. I go there a lot. ...  ... The bad: ... The hours: they close at 5. And some of the stores aren't open on Sundays. ... The bread: they don't make their own. What's with that? Virtually every other serious sandwich shop does. It would be so easy to do and it would add immeasurably to the quality of the sandwiches. I really don't understand this one. ... The bread again: sometimes they run out of bread. Hmmm...I wonder how they could solve this problem. Oh, I know! MAKE YOUR OWN BREAD! ... I can't describe how frustrating it is to drive there at 4:30 and see a hand-written sign on the door "out of bread"....not to mention it's bad business.

The meatball is good.. it didn't blow me away.. I will try the Philly Steak and the famous one (don't know the name but its their signature sandwich) next.. so well see.. Price was cool.. place was cool.. just meatballs were.. well kinda subway.. hopefully I just got the wrong sandwich.. so well try it again soon.

REVIEW #180:  3 stars  (342 chars)
While visiting Vegas, I popped in here for a sandwich. There were several options-- I went with a good ol' cheesesteak. It was a decent cheesesteak, and it was large enough to sate my lunch hunger with some left over for a later snack. I remember the service was especially friendly. Wish I had tried the grilled Italian, but maybe next time!

REVIEW #181:  3 stars  (707 chars)
Yelped and found this place because it was fairly close to our hotel. My boyfriend and I ordered two Capriotti's specials: Capastrami and SlawBeJoe. Both were pretty much the same except for the selection in meat, Capastrami had pastrami and SlawBeJoe had roast beef. Even though that was the case, we enjoyed SlawBeJoe more. The meat just tasted a lot more tender and yummy. The cole slaw and Russian dressing was delicious though, and it gave the sandwiches a good finish. ...  ... There was a line of people ordering in there which correctly reflected the quality of their sandwiches. This is a more intimate sandwich shop, there are only ~10-15 tables max in there so avoid bringing too huge of a group!

REVIEW #182:  2 stars  (804 chars)
I am a native of Delaware, having been raised on Capriotti's my entire life, long before any of you knew what a Bobbie or Capastrami is.... and I have come to the realization that Capriotti's has slipped. Ever since the family sold it to one of their franchisees a few years ago, the quality has slipped a notch or two.  The rolls are not the same, the ingredients are not as fresh, the meats dont seem to be as of high quality as they once were when it was owned by the Capriotti family.  And this is not a one-time slip up, I have visited many Capriotti's shops all over the USA, including Vegas, Arizona, New Jersey, and Delaware of course. And the quality is not the same anymore.  Sorry to report this.  Sure Cap's is better than Subway, but Cap's is not in a class by itself anymore.  It's a shame.

REVIEW #183:  2 stars  (297 chars)
I love Capriotti but I don't love this location..every time I go there they say the oven is broken. They recommended me to go to there other location near Hard Rock Casino. Which I couldn't do because I had to ride a bus 35 mins to get there.it took at least 25 mins by bus to get to this location

REVIEW #184:  2 stars  (311 chars)
I went here a few times with a friend of mine. He immediately became a big fan... for me... my grandma did much better sandwiches... nothing special about the place. The place looks worn... the food is below avg (IMHO).. I mean.. the bread is bad! but if you've heard of it, you should give it a try. Good luck!

REVIEW #185:  2 stars  (236 chars)
I'm very disappointed that they forgot AGAIN my ingredients. No vinegar, oil, peppers, onions. This is the 2nd time it's happened and it's been both places on Sahara. This was my favorite sandwich shop but it's looking like not anymore.

REVIEW #186:  2 stars  (267 chars)
Love capriottis,, great subs.. this location staffed by incompetent stupid people...  3x in a row they get the order wrong... These people in here are either illiterate or touched by GOD...  Go to the other locations,, this place sucks and smells like ass and feet...

REVIEW #187:  2 stars  (525 chars)
Not much of a sandwich eater myself. I can always make one at home if in the mood. But at the time I wanted something different to eat then the norm. Given my location this place came highly reviewed by Yelp followers and as always I fell sucker!!! ... It was ok. nothing like most people claim. Yes turkey and cranberry on any given day other then thanksgiving is a good notion, but Im not that fond of it. Im glad its only once a year and not a daily, weekly course. It was cool. Nothing out of this world. Sorry to say....

REVIEW #188:  2 stars  (526 chars)
Our sandwich (turkey, stuffing, cranberry) was good, although my husband and I both had the runs that night.  They refused to serve us tap water.  They sell their own brand of bottled water.  When I raised a stink about it, they sullenly gave me some in a small soup container.  I don't know if it's a Vegas thing to not give a care about the environment, or just their corporate culture.  The staff seemed genuinely confused why I wouldn't buy a bottle of water.  If you eat there, demand some tap water on principle, please!

REVIEW #189:  2 stars  (302 chars)
Ya Think They'd Know the Menu!. Walked over from the nearby hotel to grab something quick.  Ordered the Cran' Club.  Turkey with Cranberry.  Took it to go and when I open the wrapper to eat it, I found they left off the cranberry.  Hope they read this and do something about it.  I'll let you all know.

REVIEW #190:  1 stars  (350 chars)
Capriotti's is just not for me.  I have tried the Bobbie twice, it is just not that interesting.  Thanksgiving is once a year for a reason.  Plus having this as a random sandwich shop is much too heavy from a deli.  It just doesn't make since to me.  Nothing else looked or sounded appealing either.  After 3 visits, Capriotti's is not a stop for me.

REVIEW #191:  1 stars  (491 chars)
Got to this dimly-lit shop at 6:30 PM on a Wednesday evening and was welcomed by three friendly staff.  It was a disappointment that it took over 30 minutes to make our sandwiches even though there was no one waiting in front of us?! Perhaps our vegetarian sandwiches tripped them up.  We had to change our "vegetarian turkey sandwich" to "vegetarian cheeseburger" 15 minutes into the order when they discovered that they ran out of the former.  I don't think I want to try this place again.

REVIEW #192:  1 stars  (275 chars)
horrible service, quality, and food. they made the sandwhich my friend ordered twice and he finished eating before i even got my sandwhich. then they forgot to put mushrooms on the sandwhich that i payed extra for. then they grilled me mushrooms that smelled like male sperm.

REVIEW #193:  1 stars  (167 chars)
My wife had the turkey sandwich and it was way too dry. My Dad had the turkey cranberry and there were bones in it. I had the meatball and it was actually pretty good.

REVIEW #194:  1 stars  (481 chars)
This is the third Capriottis I've been to, but the first in Las Vegas. An this was by far the slowest service I have ever received!  Don't be stupid enough to ask for them to give you a hot sandwich, it takes 20 minutes!  We ordered and they served four parties (three ordered after us) before our sandwiches came up. Would have been more, but it was slow, and only three groups ordered after us.  Cold food is the only option if you have somewhere to be, or a limited lunch break.

REVIEW #195:  1 stars  (239 chars)
This place was really gross. To bad there wasn't a zero star. I got the Bobbie because I thought it was creative but it was disgusting. I pulled out a piece of hair and I got a soda. The total was like 15 bucks. It sucks. No recommendation

REVIEW #196:  1 stars  (453 chars)
You know what I hate about this place? ...  ... It's that they ALWAYS forget to not put mayonaise on my sandwiches when I ask them not to, so I call the corporate office to try and get a giftcard since I have bought about 10 20" sandwiches, all with mayo with on them, and the lady I get on the phone basically just laughs at me, makes fun of me for being upset, and low and behold no giftcard. ...  ... NOW THAT'S WHAT I CALL CUSTOMER APPRECIATION!!!!!

REVIEW #5:  5 stars  (989 chars)
Capriotti's has never let me down once.  I always roll in to order, and the service is fast, efficient, and very friendly.  I love the fact that they have vegetarian meats to cater the non-meat eaters like myself, and even give the option for sandwiches even bigger than a footlong (unlike that other place where Jared eats at...) for those extra-hungry days!  The vegetarian turkey is my go to sub and the sandwich alone is usually enough to satiate my hunger.  Occasionally, I hit up the Vegetarian Cheeseburger sub or the Veggie Philly Cheesesteak if I'm in the mood for meat-like goodness.  Aside from the sub, Capriotti's offers a wide array of kettle-cooked potato chips (my favorite I might add), diversely flavored potato chips, and, to my surprise, bundt cakes.  The prices are a bit spendy, in comparison to other sub shops, but well worth it because the veggie meats are expensive to begin with in the first place. ...  ... Good food, good service, and I always leave satisfied.

REVIEW #6:  5 stars  (248 chars)
Every time I'm craving a big delicious sandwich I think of the capastrami best damn sandwich they have. It's nice cause it's right next door to me I always get the 20" if I don't eat it all I eat it later. Great staff always nice when I come there.

REVIEW #7:  5 stars  (392 chars)
Hmmm Let me see if i can find one bad thing to say about Capriotti's. Nope I cant. I always get the cheesesteak sub and it never lets me down. Every time im in town I hit up Cappys as we have yet to have one in Denver but they expanded to Davenport IA Go figure. And this time they had Brownies which i had one. It was oh so delicious. I agree Phone in or Fax ordering would be nice. And BEER

REVIEW #8:  5 stars  (210 chars)
I hesitate to say how good this place really is because I don't want to wait in line but I can't believe I've lived in Vegas this long and just discovered this place. "The Bobby" is Thanksgiving on a roll. Yum!

REVIEW #9:  5 stars  (490 chars)
I loved this place. The fact that this place is so near my house is a major plus. I was on my way to get my iphone 5 next door at the at & t store where I stumbled upon this shop. My friend were all raving about this franchise and I thought I give it a shot. ...  ... WOW WOW WOW. Absolutely amazing capastrami. Finished a foot long by myself and absolutely enjoyed coming here. Brought 2 friends from out of town and they were blown out of their head too. ...  ... Absolutely bomb diggity!

The Bobbie is one of the greatest meat sandwiches ever created.  You got turkey, mayo and cranberry sauce on a giant roll.  I don't think I have ever ordered anything else from there!  That's how Double Bomb the sandwich is!

REVIEW #13:  5 stars  (539 chars)
Woah nelly. Bobbie is a wanted sandwich. Yeehaw! Get this varmit, er sub. It's a new thing for me, eating thanksgiving in August in sub form. Cranberry jelly with stuffing and a few layers of turkey makes this a must have while puttin' around in Vegas.  ...  ... As far as I know there are no Capriotti's in Los Angeles so I won't be able to celebrate thanksgiving any time I want. Sad.  ...  ... Staff are always cool. It's a requirement there. ...  ... I once had another sandwich not called the Bobbie. It was pastrami and cole slaw. B+

REVIEW #14:  4 stars  (327 chars)
Got the Capastrami and yup, it's living up to its delish reputation!  It took longer than I thought it would take to get the sandwich, though. There was only one person ahead of me, so I figured that it would be pretty quick to make my Medium-size Capastrami. My wait was less than 10 minutes and we are definitely coming back!

REVIEW #15:  4 stars  (308 chars)
My husband loves a good sandwich, so it was fate that brought us here. The sandwiches are loaded and huge! You definitely get what you pay for. However, the bread on my sandwich started to soak up the juices pretty quickly, so it became soggy. Next time we go back,  I'm dining in so that won't happen again.

REVIEW #17:  4 stars  (467 chars)
There service at times is not up to the standard set by the other Capriottis intown, but there sandwiched are the 2nd best in town, which is more then worth coming. ...  ... I'm a vegetarian, and its nice to go to a sandwich shop that not only is there a sandwich I can eat, but I have a selection.  I prefer to get the Vegan Cheese-steak with Coleslaw and Russian dressing, it takes just like a Caprastromi, and was told to me A VP of Capriottis on Twitter 2yrs ago.

REVIEW #18:  3 stars  (1364 chars)
I eat Capriotti's on occasion. It is not my favorite sandwich place. Sorry, that kind of repeat customer business of mine goes to Port of Subs. ...  ... This Capriotti's is pretty much the only one located on my side of town (East Side). It happens to be located in a decent shopping center though, one that is much newer than the surrounding area. The place is SMAAAAALLLL. Although I've noticed that with quite a few Cap's. I think their main idea must be, get this sandwich and get outta here. ...  ... My fiance and I arrived here in the afternoon one day of the week and there were a few other customers. He got the Bobbie and I opted for the Philly Cheese Steak and was enticed into adding peppers - NEVER AGAIN. And never again will I order the Philly Cheese Steak! MEH! The steak was definitely overcooked and the peppers were way too overpowering. I wouldn't even order it without the peppers. I'm sticking to the Bobbie or one of their cold-cut sandwiches. ...  ... Overall I like Cap's, but it is kind of on the pricey side and on more than one visit I've been kind of disappointed (not just this location). ...  ... This location was clean though and the employees were nice guys too. If I was rating just based off service, this would probably be a 4-star, but I have to take the fact that the sandwich really was not all that good into consideration.

REVIEW #19:  3 stars  (116 chars)
small space, good service, ok sandwich..turkey was a little dry for my taste and no dijon mustard ...I prefer Togos.

REVIEW #20:  3 stars  (631 chars)
The two times I've been to this location, the service has been really friendly. Both times the cashiers were really helpful and patient when I took awhile to decide what to get.  ...  ... Capistrami: I really liked this sandwich. They put a lot of sauce and cole slaw though. It actually tasted better after I put it into the fridge for awhile. Probably because the sauce got a little thicker from being cold and it was a little less messy. ...  ... Slaw be Jo: I didn't like this sandwich at all. I was very disappointed. I usually like roast beef sandwiches, but this one was really salty. My fridge trick didn't even work on it.

REVIEW #21:  3 stars  (162 chars)
They ar ok. Service is not fantstic. Staff isn't  attentive at all. A bit over priced. Just go when my friend pays, so it's not my money that is wasted. Bah place

REVIEW #22:  1 stars  (478 chars)
Will NOT be going back to this location. I was a regular at Capriotti's in Wilmington and Dover back East. This location should have their franchise ripped. Next to NO meat on my cheesesteak. My wife's Bobbie had almost no stuffing and waaaaay too much cranberry sauce. The portion size and taste in comparison to original locations is a joke. Save your money, go get a burger if you're in Vegas, sub shops out here just don't compare. Their subs look NOTHING like the pictures.

Great sandwich shop...the food is always consistent.  You can order online and pick it up with no waiting as well.   ... The Bobbie is my favorite but I have never had something here that wasn't good.  This location is clean, friendly, and reasonably priced.  They have fountain drinks or a variety of bottled juices.

REVIEW #6:  5 stars  (2140 chars)
Have you heard of Capriottis I "innocently" asked a friend who happens to be a Vegas local. When he eagerly responded with just the words "THE BOBBIE" I knew I'd be sinking my teeth into one of these famous sandwiches very shortly, and in fact it was just the next morning.  ...  ... He got the Bobbie, which really does taste like thanksgiving on a bun. Homemade roll, freshly cooked shredded turkey breast, cranberry sauce, and stuffing. I only had a bite but instantly understood why there are so many yelps talking about it. I got the Slaw Bi Jo, same fresh bread, fresh roast beef that was shredded instead of sliced, crispy cool cole slaw and provolone. The whole thing was delicious, I struggled to appear ladylike and bite it, when all I really wanted to do was mash it all the way into my mouth! The ladylike appearance only became harder to maintain, when the last person in our group received their cooked to order "cheeseburger sub" YES cheeseburger Sub! I realize the words sound funny together but believe me the sandwich is awesome! The cheeseburger is restaurant quality, and they will top it the way you want it, you can even ask for grilled onions.  ...  ... The whole experience was so good we decided to grab one for the road on our way out of Vegas, this time I tried the yelp infamous "capistrami" It was good, its served hot with the aforementioned crispy cool cole slaw, and melted swiss. I love pastrami, and enjoyed it, but in the end I wished I had gone with the slaw bijo, that roast beef was just so different and so tasty!  ...  ... The sandwiches come in three sizes 9 inches, 12 inches, and 20 inches, the prices are more than reasonable, your meal should run you around 10 bucks.  ...  ... Last note they had mini "nothing bundt cakes" cakes for sale, I've heard so much about them, and seen them in so many magazines I had to try one. Just like Capriottis, there reputation is well deserved. The mini chocolate cake was moist and rich and I was immediately smitten with it. 9 inches of pastrami and 1 mini bundt cake might have been to much, maybe even made me a little sick, but I didn't regret it at all!

REVIEW #8:  5 stars  (1639 chars)
I am doing a flash back into time and reviewing this place. I lived in Las Vegas for a year during a post graduate program about  5 years ago. From the look of the reviews, the place has not changed much. But, take that into consideration. I used to get all over LV., and this was my all time favorite place to have lunch. It is likely the best sandwich place on the planet!!!  ...  ... My first exposure to them was at a couple different work locations. They do sandwich trays for catering. They just kept poppin up everywhere I went (new work/training location every 4 weeks). The great thing about catered sandwich trays is 1. then are free to me, and 2. you can try a few different types of sandwiches. Over time I tried several. But, my favorite was their Bobby. It was a turkey, cranberry and stuffing sandwich on a soft roll with mayonnaise. It makes my mouth water. I was never a stuffing fan as a kid (those nasty gizzards in there turned me off!). But, this was like a nice bread or cornbread stuffing without the extra fluff. Damn, what a great combination. It was just to die for. And with several of these places around town, I could get them just about anywhere I was. I cant say I ate them all that often, but I used to run from the plaza where this one is and dinner was an easy stop off here.  ...  ... Whether you are from Vegas or just visiting, get by a Capriottis. All of their sandwiches are great but the Bobby is SOOOOO GOOOD, you just have to try it out. And, if you are catering your work lunch, think about them too so all your staff can enjoy. ...  ... Capriotti's needs to franchise to the bay area, PLEASE!!!!

REVIEW #9:  5 stars  (705 chars)
If you've never had Capriotti's food, drop whatever you're doing right now, and get some. I'm a huge fan of the cheese steak with mushrooms, but the Bobby is worth the trip.  ...  ... Sandwiches range from "I'm on a diet, tee hee" seven inches up to "I'm filling the void in my life with food" twenty inch monsters. Warning: buying the big one to have lunch for tomorrow, too, does not work. One you start eating one of their sandwiches, you will keep packing it into your face until it is all gone, and then you'll be sad that it's gone. I had a dream I was eating a Capriotti's sandwich, woke up from the dream, and was depressed the rest of the morning because I didn't have a sandwich. It's that good.

REVIEW #10:  5 stars  (804 chars)
It was my first visit to ANY Capriotti's and let me tell you that I was very pleased. I am not quite an expert on what kind of sandwiches there are out there. So when I went there I was already thrown off by the numerous options. It took me a while but I ended up going with the New York Style Cheese Steak. It wasn't the first time that I have heard of this sandwich and I've heard good things. It lived up to it's expectation. I also ended up putting some Jalapeno Chips into the sandwich to give it a nice crunch and zest. Also did not let me down. ...  ... Now, I've Vegan you see, and the only reason I ate here was because I was really hungry and my roommate offered. I can't turn down free food. :) I will definitely be here again. I must try some other sandwiches. Also, I got a free juice box :)

OMG. I think this is THE best sammich I have ever had. The Bobbie is Thanksgiving in a roll. Every bite was delish and I inhaled the whole thing in about 15 mins. My bf had the Capastrami. Just as delicious and out of this world. I couldn't stop thinking about Capriotti's during my whole trip. We ended up back here at 10am to get a few to take home.

Thank you Yelp!  Without your reviews we would never have found this place.    ...  ... My wife and I were recently in Vegas and visiting the Pinball Hall of Fame.   After a little while of playing we realized we were hungry and needed to eat.   We knew that later in the evening we would be having a big meal, so we thought a sandwich would be good.   We remembered that Capriotti's had received good reviews so we figured, what the heck.   Fellow Yelpers, you didn't let us down.    ...  ... It took a few minutes to find this place since it is tucked in the corner of a shopping mall, but it's worth the time to find it.   When we got in, we were greeted by a super friendly staff.   We decided to split a large sandwich.   After placing our order, the staff started to prepare it right away.   In a few minutes we picked up our sandwich and started to eat.   WOW!   It was good.  They don't skimp on the meat or cheese   I believe we had an Italian Sub.   The bread was this awesome soft roll.   Man, it was good.   The sandwich and a couple of drinks was something like $10.   That was a heck of a bargain especially when you consider the taste, quality and quantity of food we received.    ...  ... Will we be back?  You bet we will.   It's only 5 minutes from the Pinball Hall of Fame and it's a great place to eat!   Thanks Yelp!

This is my neighborhood Capriotti's. I've been coming here a couple of times each month since it opened and never been disappointed by quality of food or service. Several of the employee's know my name and they know that I rotate between a couple of sandwiches and try to guess which one I'm going to order that day. (Usually the capastrami or the cole turkey. But sometimes I throw them off with a philly or even a salad.) ... One time, the line was really long and my order got lost within some other much larger orders. So, they made me a medium instead of a small sandwich, apologized profusely, and gave me my whole lunch for free. ... Yesterday, I took a good friend there. Somehow, despite living in town for years, he had never been to a Capriotti's anywhere. He said - and I quote - "This is the best meatball sub I have ever had!"

Called in an order for 4 sandwiches and only had to wait 2 or 3 minutes after we arrived for them. Good service, good sammies and happy eaters.

REVIEW #20:  4 stars  (437 chars)
Some of the best hot subs in Vegas.  No matter what you decide on it's always the way you want it.  The only difference in visiting one location than another is the seating area.   Service is always fast and staff comes off as genuinely kind and welcoming.  It's no surprise they make best of Vegas every year.  Always a weekly stop for lunch and will always be a suggested to somebody that crazily enough may not have eaten here before.

REVIEW #21:  4 stars  (514 chars)
This sandwich shop is something special! Only sandwich we've ever tried is the hot cheese steak with hot peppers added to it. it's just something special.. I've never ever in my life eaten a sandwich without condiments.. lol. not joking.. even bbq pork sandwiches I put mayo & mustard on.. lol. I can't stand dry food. This is just the steak peppers and chz all mixed & put on this soft amazing bread.. the bread is the finishing touch.. lol.  We need to try some new items but the cheese steak is just so yummy :)

REVIEW #22:  4 stars  (628 chars)
Who freakin' knew you could experience Thanksgiving dinner in a sandwich? Because of The Bobby sandwich, I can't help but say this might be the best sandwich chain.   ...  ... I also gravitate toward getting a Phili cheese sandwich. Boy do they load this up with deliciously flavored meat! :) I kinda wish they could a bit more cheese and better peppers to make it even tastier. Pretty awesome choice even with these minor flaws.  ...  ... If you are ordering for two, I suggest going with their largest size sandwich and splitting it in two, rather than individually choosing the smallest so you can get more for for the value.

REVIEW #23:  3 stars  (98 chars)
Best of Las Vegas? Really? Only slightly better than Subway. I would rival this with Jimmy John's.

REVIEW #24:  3 stars  (596 chars)
Love the sandwich, hate the service.  Capriotti's has what is possibly the worst business model.  They bake bread in the morning and close when they are out of bread.  Often this is about 7pm.  This particular location is the the Smith's parking lot, so sometimes when I go to the grocery story, I think I'd really like a sandwich.  Then, when I come out of the store - they are closed.  I've dealt with this at least 5 different times.  If you're open until 9, have enough product to be open until 9. If you regularly run out at 7, you can do the math for 2 more hours and make that much more...

REVIEW #25:  1 stars  (269 chars)
Horrible service employees don't care. Give you wrong sandwiches. Get the old people back that ran it. These new people suck. And the roast beef was dry sitting on a tray all day.funny how all the  good reviews were before the new crew. Wake up!!!!! You new people suck

REVIEW #26:  1 stars  (798 chars)
This place was  a favorite of mind , but why should you call in your order live a mile away, get there in ten minutes for them to say, what order? did you order something ? then receive bread that is not quite soft or a bobbie with not so cooked stuffing or pastrami that is underdone on a hot sandwich. The girl working the register very unprofessional, she thought it was funny that she could not find the order and stated so. Her eyes looked glazed , maybe she only receive a little sleep the night before maybe she was on drugs.. I will report her, I do not appreciate her non-chalant tone and attitude. Please get it together, before others catch on and get the quality customer sales associates that your business require. I live in Vegas now and I would not recommend this location to others

REVIEW #1:  5 stars  (1450 chars)
*Disclaimer - I'm not sure that this was the actual location I went to.  It's either this one or the other one on Sunset. ...  ... First and foremost, the fact that I'm giving a sandwich shop 5 stars is pretty impressive.  I'm typically not much of a sandwich person.  Often times I find sandwiches to be kind of boring and really, only eat it if I'm trying to find a healthier alternative to fast food.  Well, let me tell you, Capriotti's is not boring and it's probably not much healthier than a fast food joint.  What Capriotti's is, is delicious (how many times can I use "is" in a sentence and still be grammatically correct?).   ...  ... I checked this place out while I was out in Vegas through the recommendation of a co-worker who swears by the Bobbe.  Basically a Thanksgiving dinner in sandwich form, it comes packed with real chunks of turkey, stuffing, and cranberry sauce (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/t3AWGr757V4Fvcun6sDsuw?select=K9tLR5HkxU-9tYZ1STmqYw).  Being a huge fan of cranberry sauce on my turkey sandwiches I just had to try it and it definitely didn't disappoint.  The turkey was tasty and not dry, the stuffing was flavorful, and the sandwich had just the perfect amount of cranberry sauce.  It was DELICIOUS!   ...  ... I also had a chance to try the cheese steak and a roast beef with coleslaw sandwich.  Both were phenomenally good.  I really wish this place were in California.  Please come to California Capriotti's!

REVIEW #2:  5 stars  (236 chars)
Amazingly good, creative sandwiches and friendly, casual service. The best sandwich shop in Las Vegas! I'm so glad there's one in Henderson near me so I don't have to drive to the Strip! :) Get the Slob Be Jo, it's way unique and yummy.

REVIEW #3:  5 stars  (415 chars)
Capriotti's is seriously awesome. Not just another sandwich shop, they make killer huge subs that everybody in the Las Vegas valley knows and loves. It's mostly carry-out and we've had our share of rude employees at various locations, but this is almost like going to the Soup Natzi on Seinfeld - who cares if the staff is friendly or not? The food is friggin' awesome and it's carry-out. Grab your sandwich and go!

REVIEW #4:  5 stars  (362 chars)
I eat here about 2 times a week, I love the cheese steak and the capristromi. The service is amazaing and ALWAYS super friendly!!! Not just at this location but at the one on Rainbow as well. The price seems a bit hit, untill you actually eat there then the price is worth it. Careful on the size you order, the large subs are almost the size of baseball bats :)

REVIEW #5:  5 stars  (267 chars)
I eat here at least once a week.  They know me by name and make the Bobbie just how I like it.  I switch it up between the Bobbie, grilled Italian or Ham and Cheese.  You can't go wrong with any of their sandwiches.  Great service, friendly employees, excellent food.

REVIEW #6:  5 stars  (1190 chars)
If I ever leave Las Vegas Capriotti's will be the only thing I miss.  This is the only Capriotti's I went to that had an actual dine in sit down area.  All the other Capriotti's I've gone to had 2 or 3 tables for their sit down area and that was it.  I think they put coleslaw on all of their sandwiches so I always order w/no slaw since I'm not a fan of it.  My favorite sandwich here is the capastrami.  The sla-be-joe was ok and the bobby is always a good choice.  They have plenty of other sandwiches to choose from but I haven't tried any others because I always get the capastrami.  The prices here are a little more than what you'd expect from a sandwich place but I feel like it's definitely worth it and it's still very reasonable.  A small 9 inch sub is around $7, a medium 12 inch is $9 and a large 20 inch is $13.  Every time you eat here they give you a $3 off coupon for your next visit.  You have to go online and fill out a short questionnaire but it's worth it to get some money off for your next visit.   ...  ... Other than the coleslaw overload the only thing I don't like about this place is that they close at 8 but they are still deserving of 5 stars despite of that.

REVIEW #7:  5 stars  (535 chars)
My favorite sandwich shop out here in Vegas. Can't get enough! What I believe to be an authentic ny style with a high counter and it always feels bustling even if you are the only one there. The staff at this location is very friendly and always greet me by name (tell you that I frequent this deli much? Yeah well I'm not embarrassed I love the subs!) I usually call in my order and no matter what its always ready by the time I get there. (even if it's smack dab in the middle of lunch hour and they are only five mins from my home!)

REVIEW #8:  5 stars  (170 chars)
The quentissential perfect sandwich, mix some old favs (cheesesteak) with a thanksgiving dinner on a roll (the bobby) and you've got great flavors, great service and yum.

REVIEW #9:  5 stars  (526 chars)
This is by far the Best Capriottis in town. They are always nice, and make the best Sandwich's.  The best people there are the guys at night, before they close, its always worth the drive across town just to go to this one. ...  ... I'm a vegetarian, and its nice to go to a sandwich shop that not only is there a sandwich I can eat, but I have a selection.  I prefer to get the Vegan Cheese-steak with Coleslaw and Russian dressing, it takes just like a Caprastromi, and was told to me A VP of Capriottis on Twitter 2yrs ago.

REVIEW #10:  4 stars  (812 chars)
Fast and fresh but they always get my name wrong!  ...yet as soon as I bite into my sandwich, I instantly forget name issues and just can't stop grubbin'!  Anyway, the staff here are nice and always accommodating.  My fav is the vegetarian turkey and I make sure to get everything on it?  When I'm not in the mood for something traditional, I step my game up and get a vegetarian philly cheesesteak with all the good stuff on it.  The cheesesteak is pretty oily so I don't usually default to this option.  However, when I'm in the mood, the cheesesteak pulls right through and satisfies for sure. ...  ... Definitely a lunch spot I frequent quite a bit.. always coming back.  Thanks Capriotti's! ...  ... PS: BEER MONEY GUYS! WHOOOOOO!! -- be sure to tip and they'll be sure to hit you with that jingle.  Cheers!

REVIEW #11:  4 stars  (692 chars)
How can these sandwiches be so large and tasty?!  Also, how can I dare to eat more than half of one at a time!   Their Capastrami has put me into a semi-coma as I talk about them here.   It's delicious though, don't let the Ketamine-like coma I'm going into block that out.   ...  ... The only downside to this place is that it'll take about 6 minutes for your order to be ready when it's an empty restaurant, and even longer when it's busy.  PHONE AHEAD!  If you don't, you'll be waiting.  If you do, yay instant payoff sandwich!    The medium could be 3 meals for a normal soul, 2 for the hungry workman on a swing shift.  ...  ... I'm just going to lie down now in my cubicle and... zzz...

REVIEW #12:  4 stars  (169 chars)
I always get the homemade turkey sandwich with peppers.  Peppers are the business!  The peppers make your mouth burns a lil but then again I don't handle spiciness well.

REVIEW #13:  4 stars  (496 chars)
If you're tired of Subway or Quizno's, then try Capriotti's.  The Bobbie definitely get's people's attention by being a Thanksgiving style sandwich but don't shy away from many of their other great sandwiches such as the Grilled Italian. ...  ... The only bad things I've noticed with this chain of restaurants is take out is the way to go since seating is very limited.  It is also highly recommended to order by phone so you don't have to stand around for 10+ minutes waiting for your sandwich.

REVIEW #14:  4 stars  (115 chars)
Love Caps, and this location is clean and fast. I think people forget it's here, so I've never seen it too crowded.

REVIEW #15:  4 stars  (463 chars)
Nobody makes a better meatball sandwich - at least not anywhere I've ever found.  My GF likes the Bobbie and thay have a bunch of other standard and unusual sandwiches from which to choose.  They're most famous for their cheesesteak sammies, but I'm sticking to the meatball and provolone as their best. ...  ... Even the small sandwiches are huge and plenty of meat & cheese fill their homemade bread rolls.  They make some of the best sammies anywhere in Vegas.

REVIEW #16:  4 stars  (1096 chars)
Not the healthiest choice, but food is great. ...  ... Only one choice of bread: a soft, white baguette ...  ... Veggie turkey sandwich: I've never had vegetarian turkey, but it tasted fairly good. It went well with the condiments and the oil and vinegar. A good, light sandwich. ...  ... Cheesesteak: We always get this with the mushrooms, all the peppers and yes, lettuce. Being asian, I guess we can't really take the all meat sandwich. Made on the spot, the sandwich is good hot with the the melted cheese and some sriracha, tapatio, and some chips. ...  ... Others: They sell bags of small, medium, and large-sized chips that I've never seen elsewhere, but are good. Slightly more oily than other chips, but taste fine. They also sell brownies and other sweets. ...  ... Service: Always greeted, fast service, cheers for beer money when receiving tips, but one negative, the guy in the front had to make a side comment about our "preposterous" order of adding lettuce to our cheesesteak. wutevs. people are entitled to their opinion. It's close, food is great, we still go, and we still tip.

REVIEW #17:  4 stars  (99 chars)

REVIEW #18:  4 stars  (1276 chars)
The Bobbie, the Italian, even just their regular roast beef and turkey. Just great sandwiches... ...  ... Since this location was convenient, I walked in to find that it was pretty darn small, two tables for four and just a handful of two-seaters. To be honest, my first impression was that it was pretty run down, being in an older building. Even the loud level when I walked in was close to being bothersome. ...  ... However, as I saw how efficient the staff was servicing their lunch line coming in, showing their appreciation every time a customer generously left a tip saying "We got beer money, guys!" followed by hootin' and hollering. The line went amazingly fast, orders being completed and rung up in great speed. ...  ... The sandwiches. Not much to say, except the obvious, they are awesome. We ordered a couple of Bobbies, the Grilled Italian, and a turkey sub with all the fixings for me. To top it off, they carry Becky's Bundt Cakes. That day, the flavors they had were marble, carrot cake, and Chocolate Chocolate Chip. We grabbed two of the chocolates. Equally as yummy! ...  ... Great sandwiches. Great service. Even though it being very run down, small, and a little loud from the hustle and bustle, this location does an awesome job, that's what matters.

REVIEW #19:  2 stars  (416 chars)
Time I start writing on Yelp as have used it often since moving to Las Vegas last year. Had Capriotti's Italian wich on Paradise/Harmon a few months back and the same today @ E Sunset. The only similarity was the bread. Disappointing and won't be back. Tasted like retirement food may, which is a scary thought for the future. Only saving grace was nice staff though one was sitting @ table eating when we walked in.

REVIEW #20:  2 stars  (638 chars)
Went to this location after shopping at mall. ... Capriotti's is certainly consistent.  And the uniqueness of their Bobbi gets them more interest - however ...  ... We were first introduced to Capriotti's in 1997 at their Buffalo/Cheyenne location.  Been back there once ... Over the years they seem to have become more like a McDonalds of Gourmet Sandwich shops ..  ... Dont care for the tip jar nor the comment by cashier when a tip goes in. ... Husband enjoyed his Italian .. I got a salad - Roast Beef was chewy and tough and I asked for no peppers - they actually put extra instead. ... Sorry Capriottis - no more than 2 star for us.

REVIEW #21:  1 stars  (325 chars)
Walked into an empty shop and clearly heard everyone in the back groan. "Oh, great." ...  ... Then one complained about the type of sandwich he had to make. ...  ... Thought about walking out but just worked 14 hours and was simply too tired and hungry.  ...  ... I don't have a lot of tolerance immature sarcastic **%@#+/?!!

A must stop when I am in Las Vegas!  ...  ... The sandwiches are under $6 for a small, but a small is huge! Lasts me for lunch and dinner, so I consider that a bargain.  ...  ... Even though the Capastrami seems to get the most love here- and I have tried it a loved it- I prefer the Slaw Be Joe sandwich by far. Capriotti's roast beef gets missed in reviews and it is a painful under sight. It rules! It is not like roast beef cold cuts, but like actual shredded roast! SO GOOD! I get the sandwich with cole slaw and russian dressing, sub swiss for provolone and omit the mayo- the sandwich has enough with the cole slaw IMO.  ...  ... Their cheesesteaks are also bomb. I wish I liked turkey because the Bobby sandwich looks wonderful.  ...  ... I also like that they have Wise brand chips and Tastykakes- both from Philly (home of the best sandwiches in the world!)  ...  ... My last request and plea- PLEASE bring Capriotti's to Orange County, CA!

After reading the reviews I expected a good sandwich. I got a GREAT sandwich. Bread was so soft and fresh and the sandwich was packed with flavor!!

REVIEW #3:  5 stars  (357 chars)
Always one of the best places to get a sandwich in Las Vegas, Capriottis is dependable and consistent. Their Veggie Bobbie* is delicious and their other vegetarian options are on par as well. I have to have my Bobbie once a month at least. ...  ... *Not really vegetarian. They use Chicken broth for the Stuffing. Capriottis does tell you this upon ordering

REVIEW #4:  5 stars  (959 chars)
Amazing! All of their subs are made to order and delicious. I got the cheesesteak the first time we went, and its amazing. The breads, meats and cheeses taste so fresh. They even screwed my order up once, and very kindly and apologetically made me another sandwich (and took care and time to do it like the first, they didn't hand it to me right away), and allowed me to keep the first one (which I gave to my boyfriend who loved it). The slaw be jo is awesome, and so is the cole turkey. Don't let the stuffing and cranberry keep you from ordering it, it was amazing and totally not what we expected. The Prosciuttini is great as well, some of the thickest prosciutto I've ever had. We frequent Capriotti's at least once a week. The ONLY downside is there is limited seating if you want to eat there, and they often run out of beverages in the cooler they have. Multiple times we have just walked next door to get a drink while our sandwiches are being made.

REVIEW #5:  5 stars  (434 chars)
Anyone who lives here knows Capriottis is the BEST sandwhich shop in the land.  If you don't know I highly suggest you make your way to one near you to get your sandwhich on.  I myself indulged in a small turkey sandwhich for lunch this afternoon.  Small by no means is small by the way!  A small sandwhich there is HUGE like 9 to 10 inches HUGE!  Oh my!   Capriottis has locations all over Las Vegas and Henderson.  Now go on, GO!!!!

REVIEW #6:  5 stars  (139 chars)
Ate here twice and love the place! The capistrami is the bomb! Huge portion goodness. Great value. Don't really care much of Bobbie though.

REVIEW #7:  5 stars  (455 chars)
AWESOME place for sandwiches. Too bad it's a little off the beaten path, but definitely stop by after you land for an amazing Capastrami sandwich. Very inexpensive! We got a 20" sandwich for less than $13!! Such a steal without really doing the dirty work. ...  ... If your taxi drivier doesn't know about Capastrami, just tell them it's in the CVS plaza by Hard Rock hotel off Paradise Rd.  ...  ... Definitely coming back here again and again and again!

REVIEW #8:  5 stars  (272 chars)
Awesome subs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! My favorite is turkey with stuffing!! Wow, all the flavors of Thanksgiving on a delish bun of super soft bread!!! The veggie was great too but their soy turkey tasted more like tuna which I did not mind at all since I'm a huge fan of tuna.

REVIEW #9:  5 stars  (82 chars)

REVIEW #10:  5 stars  (303 chars)
Best sandwiches and best customer service that I've experienced since I moved here to Las Vegas. I go here so much that they know me by name already.  ...  ... My favorite is the Bobbie.

best sandwiches around unlv ...  ... excellent vegetarian selection ...

(homemade turkey, cranberries, stuffing...)

Best Sandwiches ive ever had... at first you think GROSS who would eat that? But , if you give them a try you wont regret it! The Capastrami and the Bobbie are amazing! The taste is great for the price. All my friends from out of town or anyone who hasnt tried cappriottis I always take them and they are always glad I did! love it!!!

REVIEW #13:  5 stars  (440 chars)
Best sandwiches, period. I've had the Bobbie, Capastrami, and Slaw Be Jo. They're all excellent but my favorite outta the bunch is the Capastrami. Hot Pastrami, Melted Swiss Cheese, Russian Dressing, and Cole Slaw never tasted to good together. The bread they use is pretty damn good too.  The prices are a little higher compared to a subway or quiznos, but for the quality of food you're getting and the friendly service, it can't be beat.

REVIEW #14:  5 stars  (166 chars)

REVIEW #15:  5 stars  (407 chars)
Bobbie, I love you! No, not Bobbie Flay, "THE BOBBIE" sandwich! I have to say, whenever I think of home and mom's thanksgiving dinner, I go overboard and order the large and eat the whole darn thing. Yes, it is a lot of food, but it is SOOOO worth it darling. Sometimes I just get the roasted turkey with lettuce, tomato, mayo, sweet peppers, salt and pepper. The hot stuff is good too... I just luvvvvv it.

REVIEW #16:  5 stars  (226 chars)
Bottom Line: Very Nice Sandwich.   ...  ... Ate there 4 times last time I was in Vegas.  Good amount of meat for price. If I hadn't looked it up, I would have driven right by. Worth a stop. ...  ... Would definately recommend!

REVIEW #17:  5 stars  (1336 chars)
Capastrami. Bobbie. These are 2 names forever burned into my mind after spending my bachelor weekend here in Vegas. I had heard whispers and chatter about this place for years, but never took the plunge until my best man (I knew I picked the right man for the job) pulled the trigger and made it happen for us.  Best. Choice. Ever. ...  ... We ate here twice during our 2 days in Vegas. That's how freakin' good this place is, considering the plethora of good eats choices the city has.  ...  ... Seriously, do you go to a seafood restaurant and order the steak and complain because it sucks? I don't care if their other sammiches aren't up to par or whatever. You come here for the Capastrami and the Bobbie because those are their marquee items, right? ...  ... Capastrami: Their bread is soft, pastrami is thick, yet tender, cole slaw is tangy and creamy with that Russian dressing. Between the 2, this sandwich wins, hands down. ...  ... Bobbie:  The turkey is moist, the cranberry sauce is not overpowering, and the stuffing is the glue that binds everything all together. Thanksgiving dinner in a bun.  ...  ... Get the large, ask them to cut it up for you, then split and enjoy with your friends. That's your best bet in terms of food to money ratio. For sure, one of the few places in Vegas you'll come away a winner every time.

REVIEW #18:  5 stars  (897 chars)
Capriotti's is the best thing about Vegas, well at least for me. If you're not familiar, Capriotti's is famous for serving up sandwiches from your shoulder to your fingertips (20 for $13), specifically the Capastrami which consists of pastrami, swiss cheese, Russian dressing and cole slaw. ...  ... Man-o-man this sandwich is good. I love my sandwiches with crispy bread, but Capriotti's serves it up soft and saucy. The hot pastrami is layered on the soft bread, topped with melted swiss cheese; the dressing is tangy and not too heavy; and the crispy cole slaw adds the perfect crunch to the sandwich. ...  ... I heard the Bobby is also a fan favorite at this sandwich joint. The Bobby is described as Thanksgiving in a sandwich. It consists of turkey, cranberry sauce and stuffing. ...  ... If you have money, please start your own franchise of Capriotti's in SF. I'll definately be a regular.

Getting chaeuffered around with a friend from UNLV we got hungry. He said we HAD to have the best sandwich EVER. Yeah right.... Well lets just say I'm back home in San Jose. I'm having dreams about the cheese steak with chopped up pepperchinis and jalapenos speckled with ground pepper. Vegas... I'll be back... and it wont be without a visit to Capriattis.

GOOOOOOOD EATS!!! ... This place is the best Sandwich shop in Las Vegas.  I have made the trek to Capriottis from Rehab (Hard Rock Hotel) in the 118 degree heat just to get my favorite "Cole Turkey" sandwich.  Everyone I take here agrees that it Good Eats.  Do not try to alter the menu items they are specific for a reason.  Decor is non existent.  The soda cup is of ample size. ... Insider tip:  Order a Large and share it with a friend.  Big bag of chips is the better option. ...  ... Enjoy!!!

Great sandwich place to try out when in Vegas. I've tried the Italian and the Roast Beef, both were outstanding. Made me feel much better after a night of drinking, gave me the energy to fight the 4 hours of traffic back to LA. ...  ... Will be back again... ...  ... Also try Earl of Sandwich at Planet Hollywood, another great sandwich shop.

Holy crap!!!!  This place is amazing!   We came here to the second location just off the strip, across from the Hard Rock.  It is seriously the best sub type sandwich I've ever had in my life.  I got the Slaw Be Jo with home made roast beef (ridiculously awesome), cole slaw, provolone and italian dressing.  It's a huge amount of food for a really good price and literally the best sub sandwich I've ever had.  It was so good that in Vegas -one of the new food capitals of the world - we went back twice in two days. ...  ... Capriottis is now a must visit first time we get in Vegas and stop by on the way home to pick up some food on the way home.  I can also confirm that Slaw Be Jo holds up on the way home to San Diego from Vegas and the next day after.   ...  ... GO HERE WHEN YOU'RE IN VEGAS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

REVIEW #27:  5 stars  (1057 chars)
How can I not give 5 stars when a sandwich shop serves up a sandwich I'm still thinking about after I ate it hours ago? I'm talking about the Bobbie just like everyone else here. I had heard rumors of this delicious sandwich but I was skeptical. ...  ... Thank you Capriotti's for delivering on the promise of Thanksgiving in a  sandwich! I think the thing that it did for me was the stuffing. It was perfectly seasoned. I'm not a huge fan of cranberry - but I LOVED it in this sandwich. The crunchy, yet soft bread, delicious turkey, perfectly seasoned stuffing, with a little salty, and little sweet from the cranberry - oh, I just.... I think I want another one. NO - I KNOW I want another one! ...  ... I thought the staff here was nice too, and even though it was busy when I walked in I felt as though they were handling it well. I'm pretty sure they get a lot of business with their location being so close to the strip and the employees exemplify the fact that they're used to this kind of bustle of people. ...  ... Will I be back? Yes, absolutely.

REVIEW #28:  5 stars  (940 chars)
I always try to make time to stop by and pick up a sandwich from Capriottis whenever I'm in Vegas, preferably not when I'm hungover though.. ...  ... This location is right across from the Hard Rock Hotel and is nice and clean with plenty of tables if you want to dine in. They are most popular for their signature subs: The Bobbie and The Capistrami. I'm not much of a Pastrami person myself so I always order the Bobbie(turkey, cranberry sauce, stuffing and mayo). Its literally like Thanksgiving wrapped in a nice sandwich. It is served cold but the bread is soft, kind of like a bigger longer french dinner roll? The turkey is fresh and cranberry sauce is not too sweet so it complements the stuffing and turkey well and the stuffing is def something different.. they all combine to make an AWESOME sandwich :) I really want one right now...at least they opened up new locations in Beverly Hills and Encino for all of us in LA county :)

REVIEW #29:  5 stars  (689 chars)
I am not much of a sandwich person, but when the italian place next door didn't have their pasta ready (it was 10 am) Capriottis it was for brunch. I ordered the Capastrami sandwich. It was after I ordered that I saw the sign "The Boggie, voted americas best sandwich" - I'll get you next time. Not taking away anything from Capastrami, it had so much meat in it that there was little room for the condiments :D ...  ... The place looks spick and span with a iron-chef type kitchen look (that's just what I thought of it). But it just adds to the experience, and these guys really put a lot of care into making your sandwiches. Customer for life - now open up some shops in NY will you? :)

REVIEW #30:  5 stars  (796 chars)
I base this review SOLELY on their steak and cheese. Get it how you would when you lived back home on the east coast! ...  ... It's delicious, and the best steak and cheese in Vegas. If I lived back home it would be a 4/5 stars. ...  ... Be careful and don't belly up and order a large (like I always do!). They will literally hand you a sub that is larger than your arm. I do it all the time and always know that 24" sub (or however long it is) is mine when I see them bring it to the counter. ...  ... If you don't like steak and cheese, they have another special sub called the Bobbie. I eat these about 3 times a week during the World Series of Poker when I'm at the Rio everyday (Official Sandwich of the WSOP YO!). Roasted turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce... don't knock it til you try it!

REVIEW #31:  5 stars  (382 chars)
I basically come here at least once every time I visit Vegas.  I also try to pick up some stuff for the car ride home.  I highly recommend the Capastrami, Bobbie, and Italian (add some sweet peppers to this one).  I'd probably recommend the rest, but I haven't had them yet. ...  ... Delicious bread and fresh ingredients.  Great food for cheap?  You won't find that on the strip...

REVIEW #32:  5 stars  (288 chars)
I can eat any of the Cap's specials.  My favorite's still the Capastrami.  I've tried the regular sandwiches also, and they're also big in portions.  Also tasty.  Although many of the other sandwiches are really good, I'd stick with the Cap's Specials since that's what they're known for.

REVIEW #33:  5 stars  (94 chars)
I friggin love the Bobbi- will make sure to stop in here everytime im in Vegas!  Mmmmm... yum!

REVIEW #34:  5 stars  (131 chars)
I have cravings for these subs! Everything is fresh and delicious. Very generous portions of meat and toppings.  Clean environment.

REVIEW #35:  5 stars  (1544 chars)
I have to admit that I was a skeptic about Capriotti's.  After all I am from Pittsburgh.  Home of the Primanti sandwich, Real McCoy's, Uncle Sam's, Triangle Bar subs, and Fatheads.  Let me tell you.  This will be a regular stop when we visit Vegas again!  I had the 9 inch Capristrami sandwich. The first thing I noticed was the softness of the bun.  Even though the Capistrami is a hot sandwich, only the meat is cooked.   ...  ... The meat was plentiful and the flavor of the coleslaw and thousand island dressing was great.  After I in hailed that sub I had to try another.  I ordered a plain cold Italian sub.  I figured I could have a bite or two and save the rest for later.  It was so good that I in hailed half of it.  I couldn't control myself!   ...  ... Now I think we are clear that the food is incredible, but let me tell you about the staff.  Even though this had been my first visit to Capriotti's the people working there acted as if I had been going there for years.  I actually felt kind of bad when the girl who I paid for the meal started asking me about my day and plans etc.  I didn't expect that.  ...  ... Then, after I ate half of my second sub and asked for a bag, they told me to give it to them so they can rewrap it in fresh paper and then gave me a bag! ...  ... They also informed me that they deliver to the local hotels for only a $3.00 delivery charge!  This is cheaper than room service's $5.00 delivery charge! ...  ... So, I am a believer and definitely recommend Capriotti's to anyone who likes sandwiches!

REVIEW #36:  5 stars  (1371 chars)
I just moved to Vegas from San Francisco, and my boyfriend and I have been poking around on Yelp trying to find decent, inexpensive eateries.  At approximately 300 people's suggestions, I checked out my local Capriotti's, not knowing anything about the chain except that people's stomachs appear to be happy post-consumption.   ...  ... When I first walked in, I had a feeling it was going to be good:  I saw TastyKakes and Wise potato chips--both Philadelphia-area institutions, so I suspected that high quality, East Coast-style hoagies were at my fingertips.  I got the small cheese sub (I'm a vegetarian) and it was exactly the right amount of food if a gal is extremely hungry.  If a gal isn't, about half'll do and the rest can be jammed in her purse.  It was the first sub of any kind in a veeeery long time in which there wasn't something on or about the sandwich making it disgusting; in fact, it was totally perfect.  The vegetables were fresh and delicious, the peppers zesty, and everything melded together into hoagie heaven.  Oh, and the hours are great.  The Paradise location is open until midnight. ...  ... My only suggestion to Yelp readers is that, if placing an order for pick-up, do yourself a favor and call the (702) number on this posting.  There's another posting out there with a very different  number, and that won't get you Capriotti's . . .

REVIEW #37:  5 stars  (223 chars)
I love this place and it's usually a stop for me while in Vegas. The Capastrami is amazing and I usually get a large so I have some leftovers for later. It's amazing as a late night snack after some heavy drinking in Vegas.

REVIEW #38:  5 stars  (479 chars)
I'm a big fan of Capriottis.  First time I tried it was in Reno, NV. ...  ... This is GREAT hangover food. It's healthy, filling and the bread helps soak up the alcohol. ;)  But! Be sure to order with with the sweet peppers and not the hot peppers if you are nursing a hangover. ...  ... I get the turkey sandwich, which has shredded, fresh, roasted turkey, not that sodium-ladened garbage they sell at the grocery store. ...  ... This is my Go To hangover place in Vegas. Enjoy!

REVIEW #39:  5 stars  (361 chars)
If i could give Capriottis 10 stars i would. The sandwiches are always fresh. Something about the bread has me HOOKED like its a drug. A must is getting the brownie or lil choco cake. Who can resist sweets? I know i cant. Its close to the strip and the prices arent bad. Its a little busy but they try to get the food out quickly and their is plenty of seating.

REVIEW #40:  5 stars  (153 chars)
If you want an awesome cheese steak sandwich that will top all the one's you've had, go there NOW.  If you're on the strip, get a cab.  Totally worth it.

REVIEW #41:  5 stars  (826 chars)
If you've never has Capriotti's, I will now shed a single tear for you. ...  ... Ok, now that that's done, get off of your butt, away from your computer, go to a Capriotti's location, and get yourself a Bobbie.  Fresh bread; turkey; stuffing; cranberry sauce.  Pure thanksgiving delight on a bun at any time of the year.  What in the world is not amazing about that?  If that doesn't sound like your bag (you giant freak of person, who the hell ARE you?), you can try one of their other specialties like a Capistrami (pastrami, cole slaw, swiss, and Russian dressing) or the Slaw-Be Jo (same, but with roast beef).  Or you can get pretty much any sub your pretty little head desires.  Some locations even deliver.  This must mean rapture is near. ...  ... What are you doing still reading?  Go get yourself a sandwich, skinny!

REVIEW #42:  5 stars  (621 chars)
In a town with plenty of expensive meal options, this sandwich shop is a great more reasonably priced alternative for a quick meal before heading out for the night.  There are several fresh and high quality sandwiches to choose from.  Their capastrami sandwich is one of my favorites.  It is piled high with hot pastrami, cheese, and russian cole slaw.  Their cheesesteak sandwich is also one of my favorites.  The steak is well seasoned and the bread is always fresh.  Their Turkey Bobby sandwich is also really good with fresh turkey and cranberry sauce.  This place is definately one of my regular stops when in Vegas.

REVIEW #43:  5 stars  (300 chars)
It is a tad bit more pricey then other sandwich places but, it is really delicious.  They have great bread and the fillings are delicious. ...  ... The italian sandwich is delicious and I love the soy chicken cheesesteak. ...  ... This place has one of the best italian sandwiches I have ever tasted.

Must always make a detour here every time!! ...  ... This location is open 24 hours so got two 20" Capastrami cut in half to take home as souvenirs for friends waiting at home. That's how we roll. ...  ... A day later, heated up, still great!

REVIEW #49:  5 stars  (619 chars)
My friend Mary took me here within minutes of picking me up at the airport... and from then on, I knew my vacation to Vegas would be amazing.  Capriotti's serves these HUGE mongous sandwiches, and we ordered a large (20"!!!) Bobbie, which has to be honestly one of the best sandwiches I've eaten.  I love myself some thanksgiving, so having it in sandwich form makes me a happy boy.  The cranberry sauce and stuffing are too good to pass up. ...  ... I wish that there were Capriotti's locations in New York - the closest would be in the Philadelphia/Wilmington area (Delaware) mostly.  It honestly would be a hit here.

REVIEW #50:  5 stars  (1047 chars)
My gameplan was to order the Bobbie and eat it. When a fellow Yelper became indecisive during the ordering process, I suggested we go halves on the Bobbie and Capastrami. All I gotta say is, best decision ever. ...  ... Little did I know the Capastrami was going to blow the Bobbie out of the water but it did. I have a high standard for pastrami, and this was some good stuff. Thinly sliced, with cole slaw and russian dressing, this sub destroys all subs I've had in recent memory. The bread is great too, nice and soft.  ...  ... Needless to say, the Bobbie was very good, it just took a back seat to the Capastrami real hard. Yes, you've heard that it is Thanksgiving dinner in sub form. I don't know about you guys, but I don't remember the liberal use of mayo at my Thanksgiving dinners. Nevertheless, the mayo doesn't necessarily hurt the sub, and I dig the sweet cranberry sauce mixing with it and the salty stuffing. To top it off, the turkey was tender and very good too.  ...  ... I just might have to swing through the LA location now.

REVIEW #51:  5 stars  (441 chars)
My honey and I tried out the Harmon St and Paradise location and loved it. They have a few booths and a couple tables there. We ordered the Capastrami and the Hot Sausage with the peppers and onions. And the Capastrami was heavenly. I'm not a huge fan of cole slaw but this combination is amazing. I can only imagine the cravings I'm going to have for this sandwich. Next time we're going to have to try the Bobbie...... We'll be back soon!!

REVIEW #52:  5 stars  (608 chars)
Not normally a fan of sandwich shops but I can't help myself from stopping here when I drive by.  I guess I'm an addict for the Bobbie sandwich.  All of the best from Thanksgiving, turkey, cranberry sauce, and dressing in a bun.  I hear the other sandwiches are great also.   ...  ... I can't even think about going to Subway after eating here.  Capriotti's is to Subway like In-N-Out is to McDonalds.   ...  ... I know that In-N-Out Burger is on the to do list for many tourists.  If they only knew about Capriotti's!  If you are staying at the Hard Rock there is no excuse to make a trip across the street.

REVIEW #53:  5 stars  (241 chars)
O wow. I forgot how good this place is. The turkey, stuffing, and cranberry sauce sandwich makes you want to... melt. Next time you come to Las Vegas, stop by here when you aren't gambling, drinking,  or eating at the higher-end restaurants.

REVIEW #54:  5 stars  (506 chars)
Oh. My. God. Capriotti's is da' bomb!!!! Hands down, the best samich is The Bobbie. Think of the best Thanksgiving turkey meal you have had, and then put it between two fresh pieces of sourdough bread. NOTE: Get it toasted if you are really feeling frisky. I would seriously get on a plane and fly to Vegas just to have one. The tuna is a close second (IMHO) and the Sausage comes in for the bronze medal. The 20" is enough for two hearty meals, and a warmed up Bobbie tastes even better on the second day.

REVIEW #55:  5 stars  (661 chars)
Ok, I have never been to this Capriotti's.  But I did go to the Capriotti's in San Diego, and it was my favorite-hands down sandwich shop of all time! ...  ... I am so sad it closed. ...  ... This place had amazing bread.   ... It had a vegetarian turkey, that tasted amazing (not the stuff you buy in stores).   ... They always put a spice mix on your sandwich, which made it 200% better. ...  ... And, it was cheap. ...  ... You could get a 20 inch sandwich (I AM NOT KIDDING), for under $15.  I used to split this with my boyfriend.  It was cheaper than the small-9 inch and it was a whole inch more of food. ...  ... Everyone should go to every Capriotti's.

REVIEW #56:  5 stars  (287 chars)
Okay, well Capriotti's on Paradise is excellent, but unfortunately this listing is wrong.  Capriotti's street address on Paradise is 4480, not 4490, and the phone number posted here is DEFINITELY incorrect.  (No further comment there.)  I'd check out the reviews for the correct posting.

REVIEW #57:  5 stars  (466 chars)
On our way to the Strip in Las Vegas, we stopped at Del Taco for tacos.  Upon seeing the amount of people inside this sandwich place, we immediately changed our minds. I ordered the hot Italian Sub and it was AMAZING. It was the best sandwich I have ever had. It was delicious, the idea was cool, and the sandwich was loaded with meats. The sandwich was freshly made and grilled to perfection. 10/10 and if I lived in Nevada, I would come here multiple times a week,

REVIEW #58:  5 stars  (215 chars)
One of the best sandwich place in Vegas. I got the turkey with cranberry. It reminds me of thanksgiving. My friend got the Italian blt and it was incredible as well. Whenever I visit Vegas I definitely stop by here.

REVIEW #59:  5 stars  (781 chars)
One of the few places I have stored in my phone. This particular location is open 24/7. If you already know what you want, I'd recommend calling it in, as they can get busy. As a vegetarian, I'd say their sandwiches are amazing. Veggie cheese steak is my favorite (take it to go and add Famous Dave's Devil Spit bbq sauce to it, trust me). The veggie cole turkey is awesome too, just tell them to go easy on the mayo, they drown it. The veggie burger sandwich is a garden burger patty, good if you like garden burgers. You can also order the bobbie with veggie turkey. It's worth the $2 more than the subway across the street, that's for sure. They also sell really good chips, I'd recommend the Walker's Honey BBQ. Writing this review makes me want to order a sandwich right now!!

REVIEW #60:  5 stars  (273 chars)
One word...YUM.  Their turkey sandwiches in any form are to die for.  My friend always gets the Capastrami, and she won't order anything else.  Sometimes they also have little Nothing Bundt Cakes for sale at the counter, a sure fire way to get rid of your sweet tooth!  MMM

REVIEW #61:  5 stars  (751 chars)
One word: Capastrami.  ...  ... What's in it? Hot Pastrami, Melted Swiss Cheese, Russian Dressing, and Cole Slaw. ...  ... All the other sandwiches there are well above average, but the capastrami will KNOCK YOUR SOCKS OFF! ...  ... The bf used to live in Vegas so he knows the local places to hit up. This is DEFinitely his FAVORITE sandwich place in the whole world!  Whenever we visit Vegas now, he ALWAYS brings up Capriottis and the Capastrami sandwich. ...  ... We have yet to find a comparable sandwich. ...  ... The perfect lunch: My boyfriend and I sharing a 20 inch Capastrami sandwich cut in half, a bag of Salt and Vinegar chips, a can of Arizona Iced tea, and a diet coke. ...  ... There isn't much seating, but you can easily grab to-go.

REVIEW #64:  5 stars  (1073 chars)
Speaking of sandwiches, one of the best sandwiches I've ever had was at Capriotti's last year in Vegas.  It's an interesting establishment; It originated in Delaware but now Nevada has by far the most locations. ...  ... Not sure if this was the one I went to, but I'm guessing the other locations are comparable.  It was kind of out of the way, away from the strip.  We took a cab there and didn't realize there was no ride back.  We ended up walking under the tremendous heat afterward but eventually found a taxi after walking several blocks.  Oh well, we had to try it because of the good things said about the place. ...  ... So we decided to share one of those super long subs.  We got the Capastrami because pastrami is the best meat on a sandwich (imo).  And....wow.  It was amazing.  The pastrami, coleslaw, and russian dressing of some sort made this sandwich so unique and so darn tasty.  It was just pure bliss. ...  ... I have to go back, but alas there isn't a Capriotti's remotely closeby.  Anyone up for a road trip to Vegas?  Or Ahwatukee, Arizona perhaps?

REVIEW #65:  5 stars  (756 chars)
Straight from the airport, or sometimes right after check-in at my hotel, I hop on a taxi and go straight here. Get my Capristrami on right away. Order the 20" and if I don't finish I take it back to the hotel for a snack later (Las Vegas Hotels usually don't have a fridge though.. gotta put this in a bag on ice haha). All my friends I have taken here have agreed that this is one of the best affordable eats.  ...  ... This area is for the stocking up for your Vegas trip!!! Walgreens in the same plaza...diagonally across the street is a liquor store to get your pre-party booze. Across the street is Hard Rock Hotel to grab your cab back to the strip or stop for a pool-party! ...  ... I've gone here multiple times over the years.....still DELICIOUS.

The best chicken cheesesteaks ever!!!

REVIEW #67:  5 stars  (232 chars)
The best sandwich shop in Las Vegas!! I recommend the "Bobbie" sandwich which is like having Thanksgiving dinner all year long...and the Cap-pastrami sandwich...make sure to get that one with extra cheese and eat it while it's hot!!

REVIEW #68:  5 stars  (284 chars)
The bobbie is even better the 2nd day.  This after the sammie had been in the car for about 2 hours, driven to the airport, x-rayed, crammed underneath an SWA airplane seat, refrigerated overnight and battled OC morning commute traffic. ...  ... That - folks - is one magic sandwich!!

REVIEW #69:  5 stars  (322 chars)
The Bobbie sandwich is the best. Hands down the best reminder why Thanksgiving food is my favorite and if I ever need a hankering for Thanksgiving during December through October I know where to go. Oh and the sandwiches do keep. We bought ours and didn't eat it until Barstow. It was magical even two hours down the road.

REVIEW #70:  5 stars  (670 chars)
The capastrami might just be the most satisfying sub I've ever tasted.  As amazing as the sandwich is on its own, do yourself a favor and get it with the sweet and hot peppers, which they'll do for free.  The flavors are incredible.  I generally split a large with my gf, for the best value.  Price is $13.95 for a large, while other larges are about a dollar cheaper.  This Capriottis gets a special bonus because a) they have a fountain machine and b) they apparently deliver to hotels on the strip.  I will definitely take advantage of b next time I'm in Vegas.  Instead I had my cab drop me there before heading back to the airport.  Yeah, it's definitely that good.

REVIEW #71:  5 stars  (933 chars)
The shop is not 'aesthetically' pleasing, but Capriotti's is one of the great sandwich shops in town, for quality and price. The beef and turkey is roast on the premises. The sandwiches come in "small," "medium," and "large". But do not be mislead by the label of 'small', since the small is actually 20 inches. I usually am able to eat half and save the other half for the next day. Their smalls are usually $10 total.  ...  ... My personal favorites are  the "Bobbie" (turkey, dressing, and cranberry sauce, like Thanksgiving dinner on bread) and the Capistrami (Russian dressing, coleslaw, pastrami).  Capriotti's also has veggie varieties (i.e. turkey substitute, which tasted like cold cut turkey).  There are about four to five in the valley that I have gone to, and none of them disappoint. The one off Sahara just happens to be the closest to the Strip. The next closest to the Strip is on Maryland pkwy, near the university.

The turkey sandwich was bomb. Good price for the food. Took some time to make but it was worth it.

REVIEW #74:  5 stars  (661 chars)
There really is nothing you can find to complain about here. Excellent tastes, plenty of meat, cheese, or whatever other accoutrements come on the sandwich. Great value and plenty of food.  ...  ... The Bobbie is one of the more unique sandwiches I've ever tried. With stuffing, pulled turkey, and cranberry sauce; it presents a sweet and salty taste that has great balance. ...  ... The meatballs are excellent as well. Not dry, but very moist and loaded with tasty marinara. I would also highly recommend the grilled italian, as it contains many different but complementary flavors with the Italian meats, cheese, and hot peppers. Overall a great place to go.

REVIEW #75:  5 stars  (1442 chars)
There's really not much that can be said about Capriottis that hasn't been discussed over and over again. It's a solid sandwich shop, always provides great customer service, and more importantly, created the Bobbie. I mean seriously, what's the first thing you think of when you hear the name Capriottis? Bobbie. #winning ...  ... Here's how much I like Bobbie. It's Thanksgiving week, I know that on Tuesday I have a function for work that will be highlighted by a Thanksgiving feast celebration with turkey and all the fixins', Thursday is Thanksgiving, so obviously that will be another turkeyfest, on my Monday lunch, knowing all these things I decide to give Bobbie a holla. That's how much I like Bobbie. Bobbie is da man. The turkey on Bobbie is almost always moist, the stuffing on Bobbie always has great flavor, I'm a no cranberry guy but everyone I talk to says the cranberries on Bobbie are great. My favorite thing about this specific location is the owner/manager (I think) Heavenly. She's always super friendly, keeps the line moving, and has never messed up any of my orders. On a rare occasion I may venture away from my pal Bobbie and get a chicken cheesesteak, which is very good, but pales in comparison to Bob.  ...  ... It's great to see this brand growing throughout the country with some new locations opening up back east. I'm a big fan and believer of Capriottis and look forward to my next visit with my pal Bobbie.

This is a most stop if you are ever in Vegas.  By far my favorite sandwich shop anywhere.  If they opened one up in Chicago I would move in for at least a week.   My favorite sandwich is the  Slaw Be Joe sandwich, which is made with roast beef.  It  isn't roast beef cold cuts, but real shredded roast beef and its amazing.  The sandwich comes with cole slaw, cheese and Russian dressing.  They also have another sandwich made with shredded turkey, cranberry sauce and stuffing.  It's lunch and dinner all in one sandwich.  Oh man just writing about it has me craving one.  If anyone is stopping in Vegas please feel free to bring me back a sandwich.

REVIEW #80:  5 stars  (780 chars)
This place is awesome. A new guilty pleasure every time I am in town for a trade show. The Bobbie is an amazing sandwich that was so good that I went back for more two more times on the same trip. Real turkey, stuffing, and cranberry sauce....damn this is good.  If  you are a fan of thanksgiving, you will love this sandwich. ...  ... I also tried the Capistrami later in the same week, while good, not nearly as good as the Bobbie.  If you have a few  friends get a large of each and they will happily cut them in thirds for you. ...  ... I am a big eater, and the large is enough for two people, but two larges were good for our party of three. ...  ...  If you live in Vegas or you are just visiting, go get one of these bad boys.   ... Looking forward to my next trip in May.

REVIEW #81:  5 stars  (1023 chars)
This place is fantastic. ... I work across the street, and it has become the go-to spot for a lunchtime sandwich.  ... There is a Subway that is actually in the plaza that I work in, but 9 out of 10 times, I'll spend the extra 10mins waiting for the lights and crossing the busy intersection, because it's that much better. ... The menu of specialty sandwiches is creative and well thought out, and I especially enjoy The Bobbie, which is essentially Thanksgiving on a roll. But it's the create-your-own sandwiches that I enjoy, with a vast array of possible ingredients, the combinations are endless. The meats are all very high quality, probably Boars Head if I had to guess. ... I know, I know, it's only a sandwich. And you are right, it IS only a sandwich. BUT....if we are comparing sandwiches with other sandwiches, I can sing the praises of this place all day long. ... Note: I have only been to the location on Paradise. I am aware that there are other LV locations, but this review is specific to the LV location.

this was my second time coming here after taking a 2 year break....why you ask? i have not clue why either...stupid me ...  ... so i come with 3 other friends, 2 are newbies to capriottis and don't know what they are geting themselves into, we get 2 20" Capastrami, should have gotten a bobbie, but there's always next time. ...  ... after my first bite all the memories of how good the hot pastrami and cold slaw dances in my mouth.  ...  ... damn this place is good.

REVIEW #83:  5 stars  (668 chars)
This. Place. Is. DELICIOUS. Definitely a local secret that is gaining outside rep FAST. I wouldn't be able to choose between this place and Earl of Sandwich. Both really great tasting sandwiches, although I do believe this one is more bang for your buck. The 'Bobbie' sounds quite odd, but it definitely works and tastes freaking great. The cheese steak sandwich is pretty damn good, too! A little greasy, but the flavors were all wonderful. ...  ... The LARGE is really like an EXTRA-LARGE. A medium is like a foot-long you'd get at Subway. Definitely get the large! ...  ... Definitely coming back on any visits to LV. Recommend to all, LV locals and visitors alike.

REVIEW #84:  5 stars  (1128 chars)
Today I tried Capriottis for the first time based on other Yelp reviews.  I got the medium size Bobbie (12 in) which is large enough to split into two meals.  I was disappointed after the first bite as the sandwich was cold, the bread was cold and soft.  Tasted just like unheated leftover Thanksgiving food.  So after a disappointing bite, I placed the sandwich in the toaster oven for 10 min.  The sandwich tasted so much better after being heated up with the bread warm and slightly crispy.  This is where my 4 stars come in.  If I didn't heat up the bread, I would probably give 3 stars based on taste as it came from the shop.  3.5 stars? ...  ... UPDATE:  I've been back several times and tried the Capistrami and Cheese steak sandwiches.  I absolutely love both BUT only after first putting them in a toaster oven for 5 minutes to make the bread lightly crispy and warm.  They're really delish fresh out of the oven but that's not how it is prepared when you get them at the restaurant where the bread is soft and cold.  Upgrading it to 5 stars.  I would knock off half point if I can mainly for not heating up the bread.

Vegetarian Soymeat sandwich is awesome and everyone was so nice.   We stopped by and picked up veggie sandwiches and then headed off to the Hoover Dam.

REVIEW #86:  5 stars  (322 chars)
We don't have these where I'm from. Too bad.  So far, all the sandwiches I've tried are uniquely delicious. These are sandwiches you won't find, and can't build, just anywhere. Go in and get one of their signature sandwiches. Come out full. Be thankful.  Say nice things.  Treat people respectfully. Make the world better.

REVIEW #87:  5 stars  (1400 chars)
Well...if there is a sandwich shop that deserves 10 stars this one does. Five stars does not do it justice......I mean the service...the price....and man the FOOD....was top notch. I really didn't know what to expect because my wife had mentioned this place to me before we came out here....and she had it on good recommendation that this was the ultimate sandwich spot to visit. The situation was funny too because we only ended up going here because we wanted some lunch and planned to go to Serendipity 3 on the STRIP....but i wasn't going to spend 30 dollars for lunch. ...  ... So my wife remembered what her cousin had said about this place...we put the address in the GPS....and off we went. It is less than 5 minutes from the strip....and trust me you won't regret going there. People say the "Bobbie" is the sandwich to have but i had the Chicken and Cheese with onions...hot peppers...and sweet peppers....size medium....and WOW. Simply one of the best sandwiches i have ever had.  ...  ... Here is the Best part....we got 2 sandwiches for about 17 bucks....and on my receipt i there was an online survey that you take and you get 3 bucks off your next sandwich. I am going back tonight and get me another one...that is just how great this place is. So if your ever in Vegas and want a great sandwich at a great price.....run don't walk to Capriotti's . Eat, Drink, and Be Merry my Friends.

Who doesn't love Capriotti's??  This is a great location for us on campus who are in the mood for tasty sandwiches. It is not a cheap lunch, is you're a broke college student like me and cheap means using the "Buy one get one free bean and cheese burrito" coupon for Del Taco. It usually costs about $20 whenever I go (with one other person).  ...  ... GREAT FOR VEGETARIANS! - I love their veggie cheese steak and veggie cheseburger - and even non-veggies think it is tasty, too!! Veggie sandwiches do take a bit longer than non-veggie ones. It's annoying to never have hot sandwich options at a sub joint, but Cappriotti's goes beyond what you'd expect and doesn't make you feel like you're compromising taste by not getting meat.  ...  ... Everything is cooked to order, but I don't think I've waited more than 10-12 min. even when it was rush hour.  ...  ... I keep wanting to try everything on the menu but I'm addicted to my usuals!! I give Capriotti's five stars because it has never disappointed, and exceeds expectation. This is my go-to spot for a "splurge" lunch.

REVIEW #89:  5 stars  (65 chars)
Wow! That's the first I thought when I bit into their sandwiches.

REVIEW #90:  5 stars  (466 chars)
You gotta try the VEGGIE BOBBIE (yes I sorta created myself) ... And if you get it on Whole wheat it makes the fake turkey taste even better for some Odd reason... No it's not vegan because they still have regular mayo but its a great way to eat somewhat healthy with the without the meat guild and the same pleasure of that yummy thanksgiving flavor!  The fake turkey isn't on the menu for all the choices but i'm sure they will replace it with anything you ask. :)

REVIEW #91:  4 stars  (92 chars)
24hrs! - If your craving A Thanksgiving Dinner Come Here the Turkey and Stuffing is amazing!

REVIEW #92:  4 stars  (231 chars)
Ah one of the most consistent chains I've been to.  Always have to go to a Capriottis when i'm in Vegas.  No matter which location I go to, the sandwiches taste same.  Favorites are the Bobbie, and the Cheese steak with everything.

REVIEW #93:  4 stars  (699 chars)
All along the Las Vegas strip and beyond there's many choices available for potential diners. Capriotti's gives hungry sandwich searchers a haven filled with good eats at reasonable prices. ...  ... Their location is right off the strip and not terribly hard to get to. Parking is abundant. ...  ... The service was prompt and courteous. ...  ... The food, it was quite tasty. I mean, how can you go wrong with a Philly Cheesesteak? The bread was soft but crusty, the meat and fix'n's were all cooked to order. ...  ... The only downside to the shop is that it's on the small side. You won't be able to fit a large group in here, but if you get your sandwich to-go you won't have an issue with that.

REVIEW #94:  4 stars  (419 chars)
As far as fast food is concerned, it doesn't get any better than this. Been here only once and it still stands out in memory. I had the roast beef. My friends ordered other sandwiches and the portions were so large that we traded portions with each other. I didn't taste a single disagreeable sandwich. In comparison to other comparable commercial sandwich shops (Subway, Togo's, etc.), Capriotti's wins in a landslide!

REVIEW #95:  4 stars  (492 chars)
As I mentioned.. I'm a fan of Capriotti's! Now they are open 24 hours so you can get your BOBBIE and CAPISTRAMI fix any time of the night! The staff in there is extra cool.. always prompt in making your sandwich and really cool about making sure you get exactly what you want.  ...  ... Now that they are open late, I'm there.. maybe too often.. But I do love it. If they had a wheat bun, whole wheat..i;d be stoked.. but sometimes 'good' is good just the way it is...  ...  ... Happy Eating!

REVIEW #96:  4 stars  (611 chars)
As if I would/could talk about anything but "The Bobbie" Sandwich..  I have tried a few of Capriotti's sandwhiches liek the Capastrami or the Philly... but when i'm in a serious Capriotti's mood.. it's always the 'Thanksgiving-On-A-Bun" ..aka "The Bobbie". Pulled turkey, stuffing, cranberry and mayo..and I'm not even really into mayo!  ...  ... I check in to Capriotti's alot less than I am actually there, because I might be embarrassed about how often I eat there.  How you haven't heard of it until now, I am not sure... get down there and give them a try. I think you will be happy you did.  Happy Eating!

REVIEW #97:  4 stars  (306 chars)
As someone already metioned this isn't one of the best locations, but the food is great. ...  ... The Bobby is the go-to but the other sandwiches are good, too. May want to call in your order at peak times, it gets pretty busy there. ...  ... Also, the mayo on the Bobby is great! Wish I had one right now!

REVIEW #98:  4 stars  (257 chars)
As with all Capriottis, the sandwiches are excellent. This particular location has problems keeping its tables clean. I've been here at least 20 times and only once have I found a clean table. Other than that the service is speedy and the staff is friendly.

REVIEW #99:  4 stars  (516 chars)
Ate at capriotti's yesterday and I've been craving deli sandwiches since.  The bread soaks up the meat juices and that's what made capriotti's stand out to me.  No dry subway bread here!  ...  ... Tasted their italian sub, chicken cheesesteak and capastrami (had to try it!)  ...  ... I can't say the capastrami beats "the Hat" out here in california but I would eat here again (probably to grab sandwiches for the car drive back).  ...  ... Oooh, make sure to grab extra napkins too - these sandwiches are drippy!!!

REVIEW #100:  4 stars  (820 chars)
Ate so much, I was in pain for a good part of the day.  I wanted the Bobbie, and my husband, with good intentions, wanted to order the 12" (better value and whatnot).  At first bite, I was thinking, "Ooooo, this is YUMMY!  So glad I have another 11".  By the quarter mark, I was still going strong.  At the halfway point, I was already struggling, but being raised by a strict mom, I was not going to waste any part of this delicious sandwich (on account of children in Africa starving daily).  So I soldiered on.  By the time I finished, I was in all sorts of pain and throwing serious shade at my husband.   ... Bottom line, do get the Bobbie.  Order up, but make sure you have access to a fridge if you can't handle it, since there is mayo.  This has now replaced Earl of Sandwich as my new fave sandwich spot in LAS.

REVIEW #101:  4 stars  (62 chars)
Awesome Capastrami sandwich! Just like other reviewers said...

REVIEW #102:  4 stars  (171 chars)
Awesome roll! ... Roast beef with mayo, tomato and sweet peppers..... Awesome! ... Great value as well! ... Meats are homemade not processed!  It makes all the difference!

REVIEW #103:  4 stars  (127 chars)
Back again. Great place to grab a good priced $8.50 med (12'' though!) Capastrami sandwich! Second time here. Not disappointed!

REVIEW #104:  4 stars  (719 chars)
Came here back in May when I was staying at the HRH - I've seen this place before when I've walked to Walgreens but never went inside until this last trip.  I'm so glad I walked inside as the sandwiches are amazing!  I ordered a large (12 inch) Capistrami sandwich which came out to $8 or $9 but it was sure worth it.  They put a good amount of pastrami in the sandwhich which tasted great!  The only downside for me was that there was too much Russian dressing but it was also really good but kept globbing out of my sandwich as I ate it.  My friend got a roast beef sandwich which also looked great too.  I definitely will be coming back here when I return to Vegas next month, and yes, I'll be staying at HRH again!!

REVIEW #105:  4 stars  (578 chars)
Came here to try out "the Bobbie," shown on the wall as "voted the greatest sandwich in America." Though there was no way the sandwich could live up to that type of hype, it was still pretty good. ...  ... Containing a ton of turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce, and some mayo, each bite of the sandwich was like a nostalgic taste of thanksgiving. The stuffing was well seasoned and there was a generous portion of ingredients.  ...  ... There are several sizes available: ~$6 for a 9",  ~$9 for a 12", and  ~$12 for a 20", with the latter being the best deal if you can split it.

REVIEW #106:  4 stars  (396 chars)
Capriottis is always a delicious place to go to.  I usually get the bobbie sandwich but this time i got a capastrami sandwich.  The coleslaw with the hot pastrami was really good.  And i'm usually not a coleslaw fan.  Touche Cap! Touche!  ...  ... You can never go wrong with this place.  Load up with a big meaty sandwich and just chow down in taste bud delight. Cant ever go wrong with the cap!

REVIEW #107:  4 stars  (609 chars)
Capriottis... love it. such a Vegas treasure... even though they opened one in the LA area... well, more specifically in the 90210, it's just not the same. It's simply not as good. I get the the Capastrami.... pastrami, russian dressing, slaw & swiss cheese combined in sandwich genius & greatness. It's a very good sammich. Get the 20"... Might as well splurge. Save it for later or give half to someone. It'll make their day.  ...  ... Service is super friendly here at the Paradise location across from the Hard Rock & in the same plaza as Undefeated & Stussy. ...  ... Capastrami.... See you in September.

REVIEW #108:  4 stars  (567 chars)
Clearly the magic words here are Capastrami and Bobbie. Go in knowing those two words and I promise you you'll leave one happy sandwich-eating mofo.  ...  ... For me the Bobbie beats the Capastrami hands down. (The damn amazingness that is the pastrami from Brix in Sunset Beach has ruined all other pastrami for me.)   ...  ... The taste of Thanksgiving all smushed together on the tastiest, softest bread ever though, truly makes the Bobbie something to write home about... or at least will make you want to find your nearest Capriottis location and get there ASAP!

REVIEW #109:  4 stars  (668 chars)
Cranberry in a sandwich? Small sized sandwich really that big??!! ...  ... My friends love this place and it was my first time here.  I wasn't sure how cranberry would taste in a sandwich so I was interested in trying it out.  I got the cran slam which had turkey, cran, ham, lettuce, mayo on it.  You get to pick between white and wheat bread.  You pay when the order comes out.  I was shocked how big a small was.  it's like a footlong! ...  ... The sandwich itself had a different taste to it, but it was good.  Not sure how to describe it but it tasted like a mesh of food blended together.   ...  ... When we were there they had free coffee.  Just what I needed..

REVIEW #110:  4 stars  (1046 chars)
Decided to check out Capriottis for some late night eats.  The s/o and I decided to go with what everyone was raving about and ordered the Capastrami and the Bobbie and shared a half of each to try the best that Capriottis has to offer. ...  ... Just like everyone has said, the Capistrami is so legit.  That is one sandwich with a ton of heft an a ton and half of flavor.  The pastrami was so flavorful, but what was really good was that the cole slaw just complimented the sandwich. ...  ... The Bobbie, which surprisingly was my favorite, should seriously change it's name to "Thanksgiving Express" because it's seriously what would be on your plate during Thanksgiving dinner, less the mashed potatoes of course, piled up in a roll.  It was delicious yet comforting at the same time.  The turkey was fresh and was real turkey, not your cold cut turkey here. ...  ... Now if someone would only open a Capriottis up in the Bay Area, that would be super sweet!  Until then, Capriottis is yet another awesome spot for us to hit up while in Vegas.

REVIEW #111:  4 stars  (819 chars)
DELISH!! A must place pit-stop when in Vegas. Located near the Hard Rock Hotel you can walk here but a cab ride down is well worth the trip.   ...  ... We wanted to order a sandwich that best describes the joint so we got a Cap's Special- Capastrami. Hot pastrami, swiss cheese, russian dressing and COLE SLAW! The sandwich seriously melted in my mouth! The tang of the cole slaw complimented the pastrami just perfect! The bread was soft and easy to bite into. What makes this joint different is the construction of the sandwich. There wasn't an overflow of ingredients which made for easy eating. ...  ... What was disappointing was there were wasn't a selection of different sides other than chips. It would be nice to have a soup or salad with my sandwich. ...  ... I have to come back to try all their sandwiches!!

REVIEW #112:  4 stars  (1004 chars)
Even though I've been a vegetarian for almost ten years now, I grew up in a family that was very meat-centric. Sometimes I still crave a deli sandwich with soy meat. Whenever I'm hit with that craving and don't feel like making a Tofurkey sub at home I head to Cappriotti's. ...  ... This location is conveniently near the Hard Rock and the UNLV Intramural Fields. On a busy day the parking lot can be crowded, but there is usually space in the back. ...  ... The service itself is good and the employees are polite. Sometimes it can be slow, especially if there's a crowd. There is a TV that has been playing sports every time I've been there. ...  ... I can only rate the veggie sandwiches, and they are delicious. The Veggie Cole Turkey is my favorite, and if you like coleslaw on your sandwich you'll probably love it. My meat eating accomplices swear by The Bobby. ...  ... On a couple occasions they have run out of a specific type of veggie meat, but they were more than happy to make substitutes.

REVIEW #113:  4 stars  (968 chars)
Ever since my first bite a few years ago, Capriottis has become somewhat of a Vegas trip must-have. After a recovery nap, my friend and I ordered a 9 inch Capastrami (hot pastrami, Swiss cheese, Russian dressing, and cole slaw) and a 9 inch Bobbie (homemade turkey, cranberry sauce, stuffing, and mayo) to share. The two sandwiches came out to about $18, including a $3 delivery charge (which is likely much less than what a taxi would've cost) . It took about an hour for our sandwiches to arrive (they promised "an hour or less" on the phone).  ...  ... We initially called the W Sahara branch, but contrary to their listed Yelp information, they don't deliver (someone should fix that, unless they lied to me). ...  ... I think the Bobbie is my new favorite. I'm minus-ng one star because the sandwiches weren't as good as I remember. Maybe it was the one-hour delivery wait? Still, I'll continue to campaign for a Capriottis date every time I find myself in Vegas.

REVIEW #114:  4 stars  (247 chars)
Excellent sandwiches, great service.  The guys that work here are super nice, and make the sandwiches fast.  The Capistrami has been my favorite.  I liked the Bobbie and the Cheese Steak with everything was excellent as well.  Eat with confidence.

REVIEW #115:  4 stars  (82 chars)
Get The Bobbie. Even if you don't like pastrami, try the Capistrami; it's amazing.

REVIEW #116:  4 stars  (188 chars)
Got a large steak cheese sandwich, and it is really long!  Enough to feed 3 people.  Ordered with spicy peppers and it was delicious.  Even my 3 to liked it, she said "Spicy, but it is ok"

REVIEW #118:  4 stars  (207 chars)
Great Sandwich shop, been to this location on the last 2 trips to Vegas. Great value . lots of meat on sandwiches, Excellent service both times , especially  from Dawn . we Need Capriottis in Los Angeles !!!

REVIEW #119:  4 stars  (122 chars)
Great staff, delicious sandwiches - just make sure to ask for lettuce & tomato if you like your sandwich with a vegi kick!

REVIEW #120:  4 stars  (321 chars)
Heard a lot of hooplah about this place so i decided to check it out. Ordered the cheesesteak and capistrami. The cheesesteak was just ok for me. Good amount of meat and cheese the capristrami was excellent. The slaw matched well with the perfectly seasoned pastrami. It was worth the visit. Next time ill try the Bobbie.

REVIEW #121:  4 stars  (346 chars)
Highly recommended if you are in the mood for a casual sandwich in Vegas.  I'm in town once a month and I always stop in on every trip.  The portions are huge, the prices are great, and the sandwiches are tasty.  I usually go with the Cram-slam club but have tried a few others without disappointment.  The place is usually quiet and very casual.

REVIEW #122:  4 stars  (339 chars)
I am in Vegas for work and it's hard to find less expensive lunch places that are good quality food. Capriotti's is just what we are looking for with great flavored sandwiches for a low price. Adding the peppers to the sandwich gives it great flavor. They also have a chocolate bundt cake that is amazing. There is not much seating though.

REVIEW #123:  4 stars  (238 chars)
I am sure this place will get FIVE STARS next time. I have only had one sandwich from here so far. However, I had it twice already. The Capastrami. OMG...YUMMY!!! ... Going to try other items soon and will have to add more to my comments.

REVIEW #124:  4 stars  (825 chars)
I came here as my first meal at Vegas during my vacation. I wanted to try something new besides Johnny Rockets and Subway (which are available back in San Jose).  ...  ... The vicinity was small and a bit awkward since I stood at the register, but the cook asked for my order behind the counter. I tried the  Bobbie and the boy tried the Capastrami. We both got the small size which came up to about $15. Kinda pricey but what the hey! It's Vegas right? Ahahahaha ...  ... We were first going to eat at the shop, but decided to take our sammiches back to our room at the hotel across the street so we could have some sweet tea and chips as well as tv.  ...  ... Both sammiches were delicious AND filling so I was glad I got a small. I wish Capriotti's was available here in SJ so that I could try their other yummy creations.

REVIEW #125:  4 stars  (484 chars)
I had the capastrami here and I absolutely loved it. The pastrami has a lot of flavor and the slaw and dressing complement it well without overpowering it. The bread is also nice and soft, which is a nice added touch. I also had a bite of my brother's bobbie sandwich, which is basically the sandwich you make with leftovers the day after thanksgiving. While it's good, it was nothing too special, which was especially disappointing because the worker strongly recommended the bobbie.

REVIEW #126:  4 stars  (250 chars)
I had the chicken cheesesteak w provolone, russian dressing, and slaw.  Gooey yumminess.  Totally worth the walk from hell I had in 110 degree weather.  Cheap too -- under $10 for a twelve inch sandwich overflowing with filling and a bottle of water.

REVIEW #127:  4 stars  (1068 chars)
I looooove sammiches and Capriottis serves up some of the best in town. ...  ... As a student I am so thankful that they opened this location up right by campus. Just east of UNLV, this Capriottis is located in one of the busier shopping centers right off the strip. As one of the few 24/7 Capriottis, they get alot of traffic from tourists around the area. The dining room is small and easily gets crowded during lunch. Thankfully the staff has always been friendly and works quick. The sandwiches here are just like the other Capriottis in town: delicious. Due to its great location, this Capriottis always seems to get pretty busy. If your not dinning in, I strongly recommend calling in your order. ...  ... The menu features a wide selection of hot and club subs. Big shout out to them for making an excellent Tofu/Turkey sub making Capriottis a great spot for vegetarians as well. ... Check out my persona favorite: The Bobbie, their signature 'Thanksgiving Sub" complete with turkey, cranberry, mayo and stuffing. Though it may seem odd, definitely worth a try.

REVIEW #128:  4 stars  (275 chars)
I love capriotti's but it's way too high in sodium which is why it's just so tasty. I wish they gave us the option to choose wheat bread over white though. If I had the cash I would definitely invest in a capriotti's. If this place was 24/7 then I would give it another star.

REVIEW #129:  4 stars  (672 chars)
I love Capriotti's. I've been eating their sandwiches for years and this location makes them as good as any other. ...  ... Most recently, my cousin and I came here after the Rebel win over the Horned Frogs. We had coupons from the game for a free small sub, so we couldn't pass up the opportunity. Apparently, we weren't the only ones with that idea. The place was pretty busy and it did take a little while to get our orders. I can't fault Capriotti's for that. It's a free sandwich after all. ...  ... We ended up taking our small Bobbie and small Capastrami to go. We split half of each and it was a delicious way to cap off a Rebel win. Capriotti's never disappoints.

REVIEW #130:  4 stars  (201 chars)
I love capriottis & their sandwiches & its so nice when I can just order on the phone right before I go to lunch & walk on over & it is all ready. ...  ... The sandwiches/subs are always tasty & yummy!

REVIEW #131:  4 stars  (188 chars)
I loved my sandwich. The Bobbie tastes like Thanksgiving! It's turkey, w/ stuffing, and cranberry on fresh bread. For reals! Extra yum! ...The two dudes that made our sandwiches were cool.

REVIEW #132:  4 stars  (273 chars)
I pass Capriotti's all the time, but finally stopped in. Wow, great sandwich at a reasonable price.  I uad the Cole Turkey because I'm on a coleslaw kick right now.  Real turkey, you know, like after thanksgiving. Not ground and pressed.  Should have gotten a small though!

REVIEW #133:  4 stars  (529 chars)
I researched the best pastrami sandwich in Las Vegas on Yelp and this was the result.  I must say the Capastrami was very delicious, definitely one of the best I've ever had.  We also tried the Bobbie per the reviews, IMO this thanksgiving tribute would have been better if it were hot, because it was cold it didn't satisfy as much as the Capastrami.  All in all I'd most def. stop by here again next time I'm in Vegas, although I'd stop here either coming from or going to the airport as this location is right off Paradise rd.

REVIEW #134:  4 stars  (1694 chars)
I rounded out my Vegas trip with a stop here. The bread rolls are made fresh at Capriotti's every morning using a secret recipe. There are three sandwich sizes: small (9"), medium (12"), and large (20"). ...  ... The original concept here was to appeal to the turkey lovers, and it's no surprise that the "Bobbie" became the signature sandwich here. Sliced turkey, cranberry sauce, and stuffing, all homemade. About 10-12 turkeys are roasted each night. Workers usually begin the day's prep from about 5:30 a.m. ...  ... As much as I wanted to stuff my face with a 20" sandwich, I just got a foot-long Bobbie instead ($8.19). The sandwich is wrapped in white butcher paper. Delicious soft bread here. It's a good thing it's a thick loaf for all the turkey, cranberry sauce, and stuffing put into this guy. The cranberry sauce had a slight tartness that worked well with the turkey and stuffing. I found the turkey to be slightly on the dry side. The foot-long sub satisfied my appetite, but I'm sure I coulda handled the 20" sandwich without any problems. ...  ... I'm one of those guys that usually prefers toasted bread, no matter what's on it. Still, I enjoyed having a fresh, soft loaf for this sandwich. ...  ... I'm a fan of virtually any establishment that gives me a meal filled with fresh, homemade ingredients. There's no substitute for all those hours of labor. I see awesome hot options like cheesesteaks, meatball subs, and Italian sausage subs. Cold subs include turkey, roast beef, and tuna options. ...  ... Great service and a friendly feel overall. They say you'll "feel like part of the family every time you walk in the door and walk out with a smile." Mission accomplished.

REVIEW #135:  4 stars  (230 chars)
I stayed at the Hyatt across the street and I must've had 4 of those sandwiches in a week. I had the thanksgiving one (freaking great) and the pastrami deliciousness.  ...  ... Capriottis is a great cheap Vegas eat. Def recommend.

REVIEW #136:  4 stars  (811 chars)
I usually eat healthy 99% of the time but when I do indulge it's usually because I have some sort of emotional connection to said food and this my friends is the BOBBIE. ...  ... The sandwich has a special place in my heart. Coming home after school or from playing in the park my mom would sometimes bring home this magically, ADDICTIVE wonder known as the Bobbie. This wonderful sandwich, that has shredded turkey, mayo, cranberry sauce and STUFFING, is just plain and simply AWESOME. ...  ... Yeah, now that I reside in SoCal I could get it from one of the local shops here but it just doesn't feel the same to me. It has to be in Vegas and this location for the flashbacks of said childhood to occur.  ...  ... Yeah, I've been known to fly to Vegas for the day just to get me some. ... UMAD? Yeahhhhhh UMAD!

REVIEW #137:  4 stars  (798 chars)
I want to go to there!  I was a local and I love Capriottis.   Here's why:   ...  ... (1)  Variety:  You can't get these sandwiches most places.  E.g. The Bobbie -homemade turkey, cranberry sauce, stuffing (mmmmmm).  You can get something similar in Houston now, but this was my first year-round Thanksgiving sandwich. ...  ... (2)  Quality:  The beef and turkey (at least) are made in-house and fresh. Pulled meat, not packaged deli slices. ...   ... (3)   Quantity:  Even the small is big at 8". ...  ... Forget Subway, Potbelly, Port of Subs, Blimpie's, Jimmy John's, etc....  Go to Capriotti's and enjoy a real sandwich made quickly.   ...  ... Note:  Don't compare this to a traditional deli like those found in NYC.  You will be disappointed.  Just think awesome sandwiches.  It will deliver.

REVIEW #138:  4 stars  (577 chars)
I was here on 1/4 and there are lots of 4 star reviews, After eaten the 'Bobby', I'm in full agreement. ...  ... Being it's a Turkey sandwich with Cranberry, Stuffing, and mayo,  I thought it was going to be a hot sandwich but to my surprise, it was served cold. ...  ... Nonetheless, it works. The Turkey was perfect with a nice taste and texture. The stuffing was flavorful and served on a fresh roll. ...  ... BTW: s small sandwich is not so small. I ate at around 12:30 and really couldn't eat the rest of the day. It has to be one of the best deals in Vegas for around $7,

I was on town attending a convention at a nearby hotel and didn't want to pay $16 for a salad at the lobby cafe, so I strolled around the corner to try this yelpy favorite! ...  ... My curiosity was piqued by the "Bobbie" - a thanksgiving themed creation of "Homemade Turkey, Cranberry Sauce, Stuffing, and Mayo," but then I spotted a slightly more familiar combination of ingredients in the signature Capastrami Sandwich - Hot Pastrami, Melted Swiss Cheese, Russian Dressing, and Cole Slaw. Loved it!! Delicious and slightly messy, the Combination of bread, meat and tangy sweetness was just right for my lunch cravings. ...  ... Tip for first-timers: They take your order first and ring you up when it's ready, so just waltz up to the counter where the chips are see the friendly sammich-jockey there to order. ...  ... Oh. And size does matter: The "small" Capastrami is easily 10-12" and was plenty for me! The large must be a colossus!!

I went to Capriottis on my last day in vegas and it was so good. My friend told me how good it was and it lived up to its expectations. I got a small tuna sandwich and it tasted better than an average tuna sandwich.  ...  ... A small is 9 inches in length and without getting a drink or bag of chips, it came out to be around $7. Totally worth it. Because it was pretty big, I ended up eating the first half for lunch and the other half for dinner. ...  ... If you plan on going with few others and agree to the same kind of sandwich, I suggest getting one large and sharing. A large is around 20 inches in length! Try the Bobbie! Took a bite of it and it was good. I will definitely go back to Capriottis when I am in vegas. Too bad there isn't one in La.

REVIEW #141:  4 stars  (311 chars)
I'm not sure how they determine the sizes, but a small sandwich here is 9". Their famous offering is the Bobbie, which is Thanksgiving wrapped in a sandwich. All the food you love at Thanksgiving is here: turkey, cranberry sauce and STUFFING! Will be back for more next time! (Heard the Capristrami is good too)

REVIEW #142:  4 stars  (909 chars)
I've been going to the Capriotti's in San Diego ever since it opened, so I was excited to see we were going to be staying across the street from this Capriotti's for a soccer tournament in Vegas. ...  ... Saturday morning, at 9:30 am, I went into this Capriotti's and ordered a large (20") veggie turkey.  I planned to live off of this sandwich for the rest of the day, since I would be stuck at the soccer fields all day, and after playing three games I knew I'd be starving.  So, I ordered it without oil or vinegar or peppers, hoping it wouldn't get soggy and would be good all day. ...  ... Well, well, well, this baby lasted me the whole entire day!  And, it didn't get soggy!  It was glorious. ...  ... Thank you Capriotti's!  The only thing that kept you from five stars is that it is hard to compete when I am comparing to the San Diego location, with freakishly friendly staff and packets of tapatio!

REVIEW #143:  4 stars  (791 chars)
I've definitely heard a lot about this place from other people and decided to finally give it a shot for the first time in over a year of living in Las Vegas. ...  ... Upon going inside, I noticed it's a little bit cozy in there and you kind of have to wiggle your way around to the cashier. But it didn't really matter; my order came out quickly. ...  ... I only got the Bobbie (like others have mentioned, it's basically Thanksgiving ingredients in a sub). I liked it overall -- I felt like there was a touch too much stuffing, though. But I'm not really a stuffing kind of person initially, so that might be why. I LOVED the cranberries in there; just the right amount of sweetness to offset the turkey and stuffing. ...  ... I might drop by here again to try to Capristrami sometime. :-)

REVIEW #144:  4 stars  (991 chars)
If I went back in times and gave the Pilgrims a Capriotti's signature sandwich, would they swoon or shoot me for such a witchery goodness? I guess we'll never know.  If you were like me and never had it before, its basically your Thanksgiving meal on a sub roll.  [Turkey + Cranberry Dressing + Stuffing] ...  ... As crazy as this sounds it came to fruition.  My first bite into it, I was like, "whoa, this is interesting."  I was definitely skeptical about it, but the ingredients complimented each other nicely.  As I delve more, I appreciated it more and fully enjoyed it.  I expected it to be a hot sandwich but it was served cold, so I wonder if I can get it warm the next time? ...  ... If you are noob and order like a medium you will be overwhelmed, stick to the small as its the equivalent of a foot long.  Trust me.  I'm not sure if I would come here for anything else but if I ever do have a crazy craving for a Thanksgiving sandwich then I will be sure to pop into a Capriotti's.

REVIEW #145:  4 stars  (402 chars)
Just had a cheese steak sandwich with grilled onions and hot peppers.  Sandwich was very good and the staff was friendly and helpful.  I think you need to be a regular to understand the process, though.  They never asked if I wanted anything other than standard stuff on the sandwich.  Wasn't clear in the process when that's supposed to occur and I didn't bother to ask.  Good thing I like everything!

REVIEW #146:  4 stars  (344 chars)
Just like In & Out Burger,  "keep it simple and they will come". ...  ... I though my sandwich was small but I could barely finish it, it was dense with meat.  I got the Cheese Steak and I must say it's close to one of the best I've had.  Next time I will get the Bobbie, look up the website and the menu. ...  ... I can't wait to go back......

REVIEW #147:  4 stars  (377 chars)
Love the bobbie! ... Comes with turkey, cranberry sauce, and stuffing. ...  ... Bread is fresh and soft. ...  ... Open 24 hours, so it's very convenient if you're at the Hard Rock Hotel. ...  ... Prices are a tad high, but it's worth it. ...  ... Got a 9" for around $7.50. ...  ... They even have large bags of chips available if you brought a big group of people to eat with.

REVIEW #148:  4 stars  (647 chars)
MMMmmmmm....Nostalgia.  I lived in Delaware for basically too long and sandwiches from Capriottis were one of the few bright spots.   ...  ... This shop near UNLV was a bit off the beaten path, but it had the sandwich I wanted:  the Bobbie.   Sooooooooo good!   The bread was the same, and the proportions were perfect.  Even splitting a medium is a serious meal. ...  ... Weird thing was that they had only one flavor of drink (Sprite) and limited chip options.  This happened during the school year (March), when you'd think they'd be replenishing stuff once or twice a day.  ...  ... Tables outside were a plus; might move inside in the summer.

REVIEW #149:  4 stars  (775 chars)
Must always make a detour here every time!! ...  ... This location is open 24 hours ...  ... Make sure to come really hungry because not only do you get a huge sandwich, the Bobbie" which is a turkey, stuffing, and cranberry style thanksgiving sandwich is super filling, you can split it with someone or save the other half for later. I thought is was going to be warm, but I received my sandwich to find that it was cold, which was surprising. It is still really good, but it would be better if they made it a warm sandwich. ...  ... the Capastrami.... pastrami, russian dressing, slaw & swiss cheese combined in sandwich is genius & greatness. The Italian hot sub us great as well.  ...  ... Great service, easy parking and convenient, definitely come back here every time.

REVIEW #150:  4 stars  (1082 chars)
My co-workers decided to do a lunch run to Capriottis. I was excited because this would be my first time trying the highly praised sandwich shop that so many have told me about. When I first moved to Vegas, whenever I told someone I had never tried Capriottis before they would give me a " get out of this room right now and go order a sandwich" look. So, I can say I was pretty happy to finally bid that look goodbye. ...  ... I decided to try something I knew I'd enjoy first, before trying their "known" sandwiches because I did not feel like much of a risk taker that day. I opted to go with the 9 inch meatball sub. The meatball sub includes both romano and provolone cheese and marinara sauce. Simple, but delicious. The meatballs did not taste processed or fake at all. In fact, they had a great "homemade" taste to them that I thoroughly enjoyed. The sub filled me up and I was full until dinner time! ...  ... Next time I'm planning on trying the Bobbie. One of my co-workers ordered it and I was so tempted to switch sandwiches for even just one bite. It looked that good.

REVIEW #151:  4 stars  (457 chars)
My friend and me went here yesterday to introduce me to something a little different.  It was delicious, I had the sausage with grilled peppers, onions and topped with cheese. ... The wait was a little long, but honestly they were getting busy, so I don't blame em. ... When we finally got the sandwich, it was beautiful, in a sandwich way.  And it was delicious.   ... I don't get sandwiches all the time but when I do, I am definitely  going to Capriottis

My friend loves the turkey. I had a decent salad here. The customer service is ok, not great, not awful. I have come to expect more-maybe that's just me though.

REVIEW #153:  4 stars  (862 chars)
OMG the Capastrami here is soooooo good! We always get a couple of large sandwiches to share, it looks like it could be a foot and half or more. The pastrami is so juicy and really flavorful. Perfect amount of seasoning, not too salty like a lot of pastrami shops. They also throw in some Swiss cheese, which melts with the hot pastrami. I love love love their cole slaw they put in the sandwich. Its really creamy and a lil sweet to contrast with the flavor of the pastrami. The Russian sauce (Thousand Island dressing?) compliments the meat and slaw well too. I don't know if it was because I was drinking outside by the pool all morning or what, but I probably could have finished most of that "large" Capastrami in one sitting. It was so good! Thank god, I went to the pool prior to eating this... Or else it would not have been good for my bikini body! Haha

Outstanding sandwich of the highest quality.    My son got the meatball sub and it was off the charts good.  I got the homemade turkey & it was great.  Very nice sandy shop!

Place was pretty good..  I guess for a place out there... the pastrami was pretty good... I still prefer The Hat... but I have yet to eat at Katz Deli in NYC....I'd go to that place before I go to Pink's in Planet Hollywood.....ever again....

REVIEW #157:  4 stars  (213 chars)
Pretty tasty sandwich shop. Stopped here on my way home. I got the turkey with cranberry and stuffing. It was pretty good...I should've gone for the small sandwich. I'll definitely come back to try something else.

REVIEW #158:  4 stars  (606 chars)
Sarah and I liked what we saw when we had to get out for some air and find makeup sponges for my costume. Walking across the street from The Hard Rock Hotel we saw that there was the perfect strip mall (if such a thing exists).  ...  ... We're talkin' a pizza shop, cheesesteaks, sushi, Indian, and a liquor store and pharmacy! All in one small, clean, and easy to access strip mall!  ...  ... Way cool.  ...  ... Anyway had to try the Capriotti's and well... liked the peppers, but other than that, gonna say the steak was slightly better than a-ok. No wow, or holy shit. More like, it'll do in a pinch...

REVIEW #159:  4 stars  (1437 chars)
So I'm feeling all queasy and lazy... probably due to the sun or the 2 yard long cocktails I had by the pool... but I was craving a capastrami from Capriotti's! Went on yelp to find their number since their website only lists the address and no phone # (wth!?)... Saw that they deliver!!! Called the store, they said another store was actually closer to our hotel. Called that store and they said this store was closer. Called this store back and they were like "Oh they won't do it huh?" At this point, I felt like I didn't want to give my money to a business who didn't appreciate me. But I really wanted a capistrami! ...  ... So we placed our order over the phone, was told there's a $3 delivery charge. I'll pay you $10! cuz it'd cost $20 round trip for me if I had to cab it over. Then they asked for our delivery address... we're at Monte Carlo, room ... "Wait you're guest at the hotel? We can't deliver to guests, only to workers, per the hotel policy" UGH I want my sandwich!! Fine we'll come pick it up. I wanted to write a 1 star yelp review but I was too hungry to concentrate. ...  ... When we got there, the guy helping us was so apologetic and gave us a free sandwich on top of our order. And that 1-star review I originally drafted is a thing of the past. Yes I'm Asian, free stuff = more stars on yelp. But yes, their sandwiches are freaking delicious so they never deserved 1 star anyway. I was just hungry and cranky.

REVIEW #160:  4 stars  (443 chars)
SO YUMMY!  My hubby and I ordered the veggie cheese steak sandwhich.  The bread here is awesome!  Very fresh!  The sandwich had a ton of filling!  Tons of veggie chicken, peppers and onions and melted cheese.  I also tried the salad my mom got with the cranberry dressing, really unique and flavorfull.  My friend got the meatball sandwich and it looked awesome!  He said it tasted just as awesome hehe.  Will come back next time i'm in Vegas.

REVIEW #161:  4 stars  (974 chars)
Sometimes you just want to grab a quick bite, but it's hard to stomach the high prices for subpar food (I'm looking at you, Carnegie!).  And if you're like me, you're not quite sure where to go, either, since you're not a local.  Enter yelp.  Yelp results showed Capriotti's was rated highly and priced juuust right. ...  ... I got the "small" capastrami - pastrami, swiss cheese, cole slaw with russian dressing -- delicious.  It's no Langer's pastrami sandwich (in L.A.), but it was pretty good.  My friend got the slaw be joe sandwich - roast beef, cole slaw, russian dressing.  He didn't like it as much as the pastrami, so I definitely recommend the capastrami over it.   ...  ... I would definitely come back.  The funny thing is, I thought Capriotti's was a sandwich franchise in Vegas only (they have multiple shops within a 5 mile radius).  Turns out there's one in LA (Beverly Hills), so I drove 4 hours to "discover" a sandwich shop that's been here all along. ;)

REVIEW #162:  4 stars  (724 chars)
Stopped in during a recent visit to Vegas for Superbowl weekend. I gotta say I was impressed. I had the small (9') I think it was meatball and it was bigger than most foot longs that you would get at Subway or whatever. Another thing, is these were all solid sandwiches, not like Subway where the thing is mostly lettuce and very little meat and cheese.  The meatball and sauce was tasty and the bread was nice and soft. Yeah this place is a lil pricey but you get what you pay for. This one was conveniently Located directly across from the Hard Rock where we were staying but I guess they have them all over the greater Las Vegas area. Oh, the one bad thing is it was kind of a wait so don't go here if you're in a  rush..

REVIEW #163:  4 stars  (291 chars)
The bobbie is delicious.  If you like thanksgiving, this is the whole meal in one sandwich. ...  ... Not a huge fan of their philly cheesesteak although it wasn't bad.  Just nothing to come here for. ...  ... This is the best location from the strip.  Right across from the Hard Rock Casino.

REVIEW #164:  4 stars  (156 chars)
The Bobbie was to die for! Like an explosion of thanksgiving in my mouth! Delivery guy was a bit slow, though the sandwich quality more than made up for it!

REVIEW #165:  4 stars  (447 chars)
The Bobbie. It's good. It's different. It's thanksgiving in a sandwich. Cranberry, mayo and turkey never tasted so good on a roll. It's one of those perfect meals on the way back to LA.  ...  ... There's nothing else to say. I'm sure they have excellent sandwiches. I've even tried one before but the fact remains. Nobody is doing too much for thanksgiving in a sandwich these days. For those in Los Angeles there are a few locations to check out.

REVIEW #167:  4 stars  (490 chars)
The caprasrami is what you should get! Go large for 20" of this bad boy.  ...  ... My wife and I thought it was really good. ...  ... The salty, hot pastrami mixed with a tangy, cold slaw on a soft philly roll does it. ...  ... I'm assuming this is a Philly staple because they serve tasty kakes. ...  ... Since there are multiple locations off the strip, there's no excuse to not try this place! ...  ... My only complaint is that it could have had more meat...there's never too much meat!

REVIEW #168:  4 stars  (480 chars)
The sandwiches are huge!!!! We all ordered a small and had leftovers for the next days lunch!!! My hubby and I ordered the Italian, one was hot and the other cold.  I liked the cold one and my husband liked the hot one.  I usually like hot sandwiches with the onions grilled but I just like the flavor of the cold one better.  My girls got the ham and cheese cold and the picky eaters ate it!!!  I will be back next time I'm in Vegas so I can try the roast beef or the Capastrami.

REVIEW #169:  4 stars  (273 chars)
The thanksgiving meal in a sandwich is actually very good, I would return and try the others next visit to  Las Vegas,.  The location is a couple of streets back from the strip ; I like to eat off strip as I tend to find many more food choices just a couple of blocks away.

REVIEW #170:  4 stars  (95 chars)
The veggie turkey "meat" is so good. The best I've had. Yay for having good vegetarian options!

REVIEW #171:  4 stars  (408 chars)
Their sandwiches are pretty good, I ate the cheesestake and the Bobbie.   ...  ... The cheese stake is pretty much a philly cheese steak, so nothing new there but tastes good. ...  ... The bobbie is pretty much thanksgiving leftovers into a sandwich; you have the turkey, mayo, stuffings, and cranberry for the sweet flavor.  Quite good. ...  ... Pricing is reasonable and their size can get up to 20 inches.

REVIEW #172:  4 stars  (509 chars)
This is a good sandwich shop because you get a lot for your money. And it's a good place to decompress if you want to get away from all the excitement in Las Vegas. When I went there, the place was completely empty! However, don't let that deter you from checking it out. ...  ... The only thing this place needs is hot sauce. I'm used to finding that at sandwich shops, and I was surprised to find that they didn't have any here. ...  ... Good sandwiches and fun employees make this place worth checking out.

REVIEW #173:  4 stars  (237 chars)
This place is bomb. Got the cold roast beef sandwich. They give a very good amount of meat and the bread is nice and soft. I heard very good things about their Philly cheesesteaks also, so I'll be sure to try that out the next time I go.

REVIEW #174:  4 stars  (796 chars)
This place knows subs!!!  We went here at the recommendation of a friend and so glad we made the trek from the strip to give this place a try.  Since we had never been before, we went with 2 of the signature subs.  My friend got the Italian and I got the Roast Beef.  Both were packed with tons of delicious meats and really fresh veggies.  The Italian has a good mix of premium italian meats which were not too salty.  ... For the Roast Beef, I got all of the fixins' to include sweet peppers, onions, italian seasoning and oil & vinegar.  The roast beef was shredded which was a nice touch over your standard sliced meat at other sub shops.   ...  ... In writing this review, I just found out there's one in Encino so I can't wait to try it out when I get back home!   ...  ... Good stuff here!

REVIEW #175:  4 stars  (1051 chars)
True story: this place nearly killed me. As in, ended my life. I was in between day classes, and I was already exhausted from working my night job. I made my bi-weekly pilgrimage to the Maryland Pkwy location to get a Bobbie-- ...  ... --It really is as good as you've heard. Its like thanksgiving every day, especially useful in a city that has no semblance of seasons...no fall leaves, no nippy Thanksgiving-type weather....the Bobbie is as close as you're gonna get to an authentic Thanksgiving experience in this God-Forsaken town. ...  ... Anyway. Got a Bobbie, the place was packed and I was in a hurry, ate it in my car. The sandwich was so good, I fell asleep in my car. In the 110 degree heat. Woke up ~20 minutes later, felt really sick, confused, and short of breath. I tried to stand up, promptly threw up, missed my afternoon class, and wasted a great sandwich. ...  ... It was the heat stroke that made me puke, btw...not the sandwich. ...  ... Highlights include THE BOBBIE, really excellent vegetarian options, and proximity to campus.

Tucked into a strip mall, a quick walk across the street from the Hard Rock Hotel. Unique sandwich choices, great quality food. Even the "small" sandwich was filling. You order your sandwich & then pay for it at the register once they call your name.

REVIEW #178:  4 stars  (209 chars)
Very glad I took a chance going in. Got the "Bobbie" and it was great. The "Bobbie" is pretty much Thanksgiving on a sub bun and I have no problems with that. Will have to try it again before vacation is over.

REVIEW #179:  4 stars  (1267 chars)
We recently catered a work lunch with Capriotti's, so I was able to sample a variety of their offerings.  Roast beef, italian, meatball were all solid and reminiscent of other great deli sandwiches I have come across, and their famous "Bobbie" sandwich, which is pretty much Thanksgiving wrapped in a roll, uses top notch turkey along with cranberry sauce, stuffing, and mayo.  But the sandwich that really blew my socks off was the Capistrami: ...  ... The Capistrami is pretty much what must have resulted when Mr.  Reuben  got it on with Miss Memphis Pulled Pork at Club Sandwich (sidenote: my latest theory on the origin of the enigmatic middle slice of bread in a club sandwich is that it actually represents two sandwiches hooking up, why do you think the other famous sandwich with three slices of bread is called the Big Mac?  Coincidence, I think not!) and conceived a baby consisting of hot pastrami, swiss cheese, russian dressing, and cole slaw.   Throw in some heat with their spicy pepper relish and your taste buds won't know what hit them.  Whereas the Bobbie allows you to experience Thanksgiving year round, the Capistrami allows you to experience New Year's Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, and Labor Day all at once...i.e. gustatory FIREWORKS!

What a great sandwich! Had the cole turkey and the slaw be Jo and they were both delicious. I like cole slaw in my sandwiches, so my opinion might be alittle bias. If I had a choice between the earl of sandwiches or capriottis sandwiches it would be Capriottis hands down. Will be a regular stop when I visit the Vegas area

REVIEW #182:  4 stars  (656 chars)
When I lived in Vegas this was THE spot for sandwiches. Period. Easily the best deli in Las Vegas. Easily. There are actually a lot of imitators, Port a sub, blah blah blah. Cap's is the best. I always recommend and they never let me down. Couple of things though... Sometimes they run out of bread which I thought was kinda ghetto.  Its expensive (for a deli) and there's no space to eat. Just one long skinny wall "table". But whatever, I like the subs but also love ordering two tuna sandwiches light onion. Yum... my stomach is growling. ...  ... CLIFFNOTES: If you like subs or deli's EAT AT CAP's! ... ps: I damn near wanna give them 5 stars...Almost

With visiting Las Vegas comes the search for food. We were staying at the Hard Rock Hotel and so my roomies decided to go across the street to find some since we wanted some pizza. Luckily for us, right next to the pizza place is Capriottis! I saw my buddies walk in with two long subs. Initially, I was going for the pizza until I found out they got a Cheese Steak! So, I decided to try it and oh man.... it was amazing! ...  ... The bread was perfect and the sandwich was filled with delicious steak cooked to perfection, melted white American cheese, mushroom, onions, and hot peppers, which gave it an awesome kick!  Always, always, always add the mushroom, onions and definitely the hot peppers. You will not regret it! Everything was perfectly melted together and the taste was Mmmm Mmmm good! I couldn't stop with one bite or just a small portion. I'll just say that we ended up going back to get more the next day. ...  ... The service is awesome here and the guys are really awesome. That's always icing on the cake when the service is excellent. Also, this place is open really late. So, if you have the late night cravings going on, check them out and you'll be able to get your fill from Capriottis!

REVIEW #184:  4 stars  (269 chars)
Wow, just wow. I had the Capastrami and it was fantastic. The meat was tender and plenty of it. It had just the right amount of slaw and sauce to not overwhelm the sandwich. ...  ... Service was fine. Most of the tables were dirty,but that's my only knock on the place.

REVIEW #185:  4 stars  (503 chars)
yum!!!  i actually ordered cran-slam club... it was good, but i did find the turkey a bit dry...  but my cousins ordered capastrami and the bobbie... so of course i had to take a bite of their sandwiches... the bobbie was soooo yummy!!!!  having tasted my sandwich, i have to say that it's the stuffing that makes the bobbie so yummy and not so dry!!!!  and capastrami was also very good!!! ...  ... just found out there's a capriottis in beverly hills...i can't wait to go there and order the bobbie!!!

REVIEW #186:  3 stars  (1058 chars)
Almost need to do 2 reviews for this place. Food is great, one of my favorite sandwiches around. I don't buy into the Bobbie hype, that's a so-so sandwich to me. I prefer the ham and cheese. Either way, they always taste fresh and the price can't be beat. ...  ... Gripe 1 - Why they don't take a RebelCard discount is beyond me, all the other business around here do AND the company is owned by UNLV Alum.... ...  ... Gripe 2 - the absolute WORST ordering counter ever. It's about 5 feet tall and 3 feet wide so if you're short (I am not) you have to stand on your tip toes and either way you have to shout your order. It's very confusing too, when people come in they're not sure whether to order at this monstrosity of a counter or the cashier counter, there's no signs and no employee actually offers any help or direction. ...  ... Gripe 3 - it's always too friggen hot in there. Even in winter. Summer, forget about it, you're sweating your ass off - period. ...  ... So for that I give 3 stars. It would be 5 for the food and 1 for the actual business

Delicious food, but if you're vegan, STAY AWAY. Don't be fooled by the faux meat.

REVIEW #188:  3 stars  (594 chars)
Delicious Philly/Delaware style subs.  Capriottis has been a favorite of mine since spending summers in my youth in the PA/DE/MD Tri-State area.  The story of Capriottis coming west to Las Vegas is a great American Success story. ...  ... I have spent all my time at another Capriottis location when in Las Vegas, and on this day I gave the shop on Paradise a shot.  The food was good not great, the sandwich was carelessly made and the store was not exactly clean.  I still recommend to anyone to eat here, but I am throwing it out for the owner to put a little more scrutiny on this location.

REVIEW #189:  3 stars  (158 chars)
Great ingredients. Bread has a very rubber texture. Almost as if you want to cut the crust off like when you were a kid except its a hoagie and its all crust.

REVIEW #190:  3 stars  (172 chars)
I don't agree if it's the BEST sandwiches around but they are certainly the biggest and thistly, the most filling.  Great customer service.  Wouldn't hesitate to come back.

I enjoyed this place and think it's the closest thing to a Philly Cheese Steak in Las Vegas that your going to get.  Not on the Philly level but not too far off.

REVIEW #192:  3 stars  (916 chars)
I had just picked up a friend from the airport who was hungry for food.  The problem is that she is vegan, and it was 11pm.  Where to go?  I typed in vegan to Yelp and Capriottis popped up, so I figured we'd give it a try since it's cheap. ...  ... Now I've had the Bobby a million times and love Capriotti's, but this review is about this particular visit.  My friend asked about vegan sandwiches, and the guy working the counter said the veggie Philly cheese steak was vegan if you don't get the cheese.  So she ordered it. ...  ... After a bit of a wait, we discovered they made a regular Philly cheese steak, which I had a bit of since they were just going to throw it away.  When they finally made her vegan version, she tried it and wasn't convinced that it wasn't actual chicken.  He said it indeed was, but I agree that it looked and tasted an awful lot like chicken.  Was it or wasn't it?  We'll never know.

I had the cheesesteak, the meat wasn't especially juicy or flavorful, but the sandwich was put together faithfully.  I know it's not their best sandwich, but I say don't have it on the menu if you don't want to be judged by it.  Chips were awful; although they didn't make them, there aren't too many alternatives for sides.  I ordered the large, and it is indeed large, but I would've settled for less if it tasted that much better.

REVIEW #194:  3 stars  (946 chars)
I'm sorry but mediocre at best.  Jimmy johns it is.  Jersey mikes might be better too.  Turkey is carved and fresh but slightly dry so the heaping amount of cole slaw takes away from tbe dry taste.  My opinion, too much cole slaw, not enough turkey.  Nice friendly staff and quick service though, and tv in the place to watch the football games on Sunday.  Don't know how people can give 5 stars for paying 9.50 for a sandwich and drink.  Oh, bread is average at best,  ... Maybe too chewy.  I had bread last night at maggianis,  that's good bread there. Dry turkey with smallish portions and too much cole slaw make it barely a 3 star.  It's a different concept of pulled turkey and I give them props for that.  Service is quick and friendly , props for that.  Just don't skimp on the best thing, the turkey. Oh, and as I was leaving, 2 people complained.  One wanted more provolone as they skimped on it, and another asked why no wheat options.

REVIEW #195:  3 stars  (835 chars)
I've read the reviews about this place and was so excited to bring my friends to try this new, cheap place that has a thanksgiving sandwich. However, everyone fails to mention that the Bobbie is a cold sandwich and i think that takes away from the sandwich immensely.  ...  ... I mean it was an alright sandwich but i felt that the hype brought on by yelpers and locals that i spoke to was in a word, exaggerated. The sandwich even had mayo on it.....mayo....thanksgiving dinner....I know I'm Chinese but even we don't have mayo on thanksgiving dinner. ...  ... I will say though that the woman workin the counter who was kind of butch was very nice and had a lot of local flavor to her. she even suggested for my friends and I to get the larger sandwich to save a little cash. After losing 900 dollars on craps, I appreciated the tip!

REVIEW #196:  3 stars  (570 chars)
Located right beside the In-Out Burger (which I enjoyed more for cheap eats), they had a unique menu. I tried the Bobbie which so many yelpers raved about, but found it to be a bit disappointing. The turkey was a little dry, the stuffing was lacking, but the cranberry sauce made a surprsingly tasty hit. I would eat there again, but it would not be on top of my list of places to go. ...  ... Good:  ... - Big cheap sandwiches. ... - The Bobbie can be found here. ...  ... Bad:  ... - Not as amazing as many make it out to be. ... - A little dirty, but I've seen worse.

REVIEW #197:  3 stars  (222 chars)
Sandwiches are good, I'm a fan of the Italian. Trouble is they often run out of bread at the Ft. Apache/Tropicana location often. They've lost my business on my last three visits. Best not to try at dinner time, I suppose.

REVIEW #198:  3 stars  (675 chars)
The pastrami sandwich is pretty good. The sandwich was giant and 2 of us ate it for 2 meals. However... I'm a puritan at heart about pastrami and I feel I've been short-changed by not having it on rye. Plus... the sandwich isn't toasted which is the way I like a sub roll if need be. ...  ... People have raved about the turkey gobbler... I found it boring. Shredded turkey, canned cranberry sauce and mayo on a sub roll. Eh...? ...  ... The staff at the Henderson store is maddeningly disorganized. But even with all the faults, I do come back occasionally. ...  ... Some would argue this is the best sandwich shop in Las Vegas... well,.. I don't agree. I'm still searching.

REVIEW #199:  3 stars  (391 chars)
The sandwiches were average tasting to me, nothing that great about their sandwiches that another sandwich place can't make. Regular bread, regular toppings, and regular meats makes you a regular sandwich. They however do have some interesting items; "The Bobbie" : turkey meat, stuffing, cranberry sauce, and gravy? It's like Thanksgiving in a sandwich; it looked nasty and tasted the same.

REVIEW #200:  3 stars  (254 chars)
This place has a great menu, but they need to lighten up on the dressing. It was overwhelming how much thousand island they put on my small sub, like half a bottles worth. Whoa. I wiped some of the dressing off and realized this place is a bit overrated.

REVIEW #201:  3 stars  (998 chars)
Tried Capriotti's for the first time this weekend in Vegas. I had just come back from the Avicii pool party thinking I was really hungry. Unfortunately I drank too much to stomach more than half of my sandwich.  ...  ... Nonetheless, the sandwiches were delicious. My boyfriend ordered the capastrami and I ordered the slaw be jo. The capastrami was pretty delicious but still on the dry side. The slaw be jo sandwich had roast beef and coleslaw. It was alright. I've had better sandwiches. The bread on both sandwiches wasn't even toasted. I may have made the mistake of not ordering "America's favorite sandwich" the Bobbie, but I just wasn't sure if I wanted thanksgiving in a sandwich. I will have to come back and try it again. ...  ... As for service, the guy at the register was nice enough. There were drunk people outside so he may have been irked. My only complaint was the tables inside were pretty dirty. Seemed like no one was cleaning up that day.  ...  ... Overall, food was alright.

REVIEW #202:  3 stars  (163 chars)
tried the capistrami 20 " and it was humungous but i wouldn't go back. not enough seating (had to hoover over a patron) and the bread selection is weak for a deli.

REVIEW #203:  3 stars  (693 chars)
Went there for lunch today.  Almost went to Joe's Pizza next door, but opted for a sandwich instead.  I've been eating Capriottis sandwiches for years, but this is the first time in this particular restaurant. ...  ... The place was busy and the people working there were friendly.  Nice clean tables and floors. ...  ... I ordered a small Italian Sandwich with everything on it.  Got a bag of Jalapeno Dirty Chips & a bottle of water.  The sandwich turned out nice and fresh, but I don't know.....Capriottis has lost a lot of it's luster with me.  I just don't enjoy their sandwiches like I use to.  I don't know what it is.   ...  ... Will I return?  Probably, but not on the top of my list.

REVIEW #204:  2 stars  (999 chars)
I don't get why people rave about this place. I mean I'm sure you're happy to be in Vegas and you're probably having fun, but k'mon, you still gotta be fair to the food you're rating... ...  ... I came here once. My friend was pretty excited to try this place out during this trip. I got the Bobbie, which is a very big Thanksgiving leftover sandwich.  ...  ... I don't know about you but it makes no sense to me to put stuffing in a sandwich. It's just starch on starch and makes the sandwich unnecessarily heavy. The flavor of the stuffing doesn't bring much to the table either.  ...  ... My whole sandwich came to me cold. EVEN THE BREAD WAS COLD! I suspect they premade my sandwich and just pulled it out of the fridge when we ordered. Why would any sandwich shop serve refrigerator temperature bread??? ...  ... I guess if you work and live in Vegas this might be an OK lunch spot, but if you come from out of town, there are much better places to spend your appetite. Don't waste a meal here!

REVIEW #205:  2 stars  (624 chars)
I mean Capriottis food is amazing but this places service wasn't amazing. So did a deliver order. They said it'll be like 30 mins. An hour goes by..no order! Called they said the delivery guy was out already. K like 5 mins later the guy came. He didn't call when he got here so our front desk person had to come get me. Got my order..missing a sandwich! Called the store the said they'll make it and send it ASAP. Ok I give them ups for that..told them ok 15 mins it better be here. It turned 15 mins so I called asking where it is. They said the delivery guy was out. Then ok 2 mins later he came. But didn't call again!!!!

REVIEW #206:  2 stars  (262 chars)
Maybe good by Vegas standards, but LA has spoiled me.  The sandwiches are adequate, but nothing WoWed me.  I'll try once more perhaps, before I render my final verdict. ...  ... I'll say its good in a pinch, when you're looking for something other than a burger.

REVIEW #207:  2 stars  (468 chars)
my friend has been raving about this place for their turkey sandwich, also called bobby's sandwich, ... ingredients: its filled with turkey, cranberry, stuffing & a light mayonnaise on a French roll. ... Upon eating it, I think ive had better, the bread is cold, and would taste much better if it was toasted, also since the bread was not toasted, it the sauce made it soggy quick, and over all nothing that great, I can make a better turkey leftover sandwich at home.

REVIEW #208:  2 stars  (1068 chars)
OVER RATED! ...  ... Perhaps I'm a bit jaded being from NYC but seriously, the most average deli in New York is a little better than this joint. The bread here weak and let's face it, the bread is the foundation of a sandwich. The meats are fine (not great but acceptable). The selection is quite limited. And as for those specialty combination subs, umm, they border on gross. The Bobbie?! Why not just pour the contents of a garbage can onto some Wonderbread... same taste. ...  ... This place is a local favorite because you get a lot of bang for your buck. Fat boy paradise! But when it comes to quality they are average at best. I'll give it to them, they brought a mediocre east coast sub concept to a place where people don't know any better.  ...  ... If I were to recommend anything here it would be either the Cheese Steak or the Italian. Skip the meatballs. They are 80% bread. The roast beef is over cooked by 3 or 4 times, dry, flavorless.  ...  ... I give them 2 stars because the folks behind the counter are very nice. Yes, they are better than Subway.

REVIEW #209:  2 stars  (576 chars)
Perhaps it's because everyone raves about this place having amazing sandwiches that I expected something GREAT! ...  ... But it wasn't. My friends had me try the Bobbie going on about how it's Thanksgiving in your mouth. It was not good to me. The texture just felt soft and mushy and all I could taste was overly sweet mixed with mayo. ...  ... Maybe their other sandwiches are good but they don't look all that appetizing and with the first experience, I'm not stoked on finding out.  ...  ... If I want a good sandwich I think I'll stick with Jersey Mike's which is nearby.

REVIEW #210:  2 stars  (406 chars)
Supposedly the best sandwich in Vegas... I beg to differ. ...  ... I ordered a cheese sandwich and I told them to put all the veggies on it. What I ended up with was some weird white cheese, red peppers, sweet peppers, onions and some pale iceberg lettuce. Definitely not the best sandwich around. ...  ... I paid for my group's 4 sandwiches and I was like WHAT?! when they told me how much. ...  ... NEXT!

REVIEW #211:  2 stars  (672 chars)
This place came highly rated on yelp so I was excited to try it for myself. Read that I must try "the Bobbie" which is a turkey, stuffing, and cranberry style thanksgiving sandwich.  Received my sandwich only to find that it was cold and dry which was a surprise to me. It had an almost leftover feel which I would find acceptable only the following days after Thanksgiving. I went up to ask to have it run through they oven to heat it up only to be swiftly shot down with a "we don't heat up The Bobbie...."   ...  ... Next time I want a Thanksgivings style sandwich in Vegas Ill stick with Earls of Sandwich down the street.  Thanks for the disappointment Capriottis....

REVIEW #212:  1 stars  (493 chars)
I know being a local its practically a sin to say I don't like Capriottis but thats how I feel especially after eating here about a million times. ...  ... These are the reasons why: too much bread for the sandwiches, gross selection of chips, expensive for a sub, cheap deli meats and only pre-shredded iceberg lettuce available no mixed greens or spinach. Also the stuffing for the turkey sandwich, with cranberry sauce, is either bland or alternates with being really salty and dry/crumbly.

REVIEW #213:  1 stars  (738 chars)
I've eaten at the Capriottis at the Sante Fe Station Casino a few times. A few months back, when ordering a turkey sandwich, not the sub, but the sandwich, I was delighted by a real deli sized meal. Last week, when I ordered a tuna sandwich it was more like a bread and tomato sandwich with maybe 2 oz. of tuna. It was pathetic. It was like a "tuna spray" for flavoring. So last night I ordered the turkey - and again, same lousy experience. It was as if someone sprinkled turkey like a pizza topping on it. Maybe 2 oz on the entire sandwich. I had to scrape it off the huge roll so I could taste it at all. Bad experience again. No more Capriottis for me - there's too much excellent competition out there with Firehouse subs and others.

REVIEW #214:  1 stars  (1050 chars)
OK, so this was my first visit to ANY Capriotti's and was expecting good things. I order their "Capastrami which is a 9" pastrami sandwich served on a roll with Russian dressing and cole slaw. I ask to have the cole slaw served on the side instead of in the sandwich, which they did. It took them a little more than 5 minutes to prepare it. Now I have eaten enough pastrami in my life to know that good pastrami has been salt cured and has a bold spicy, smoke infused flavor. Capriotti's pastrami tasted almost totally bland. Even the saltiness had somehow been leached out of it. The sandwich roll had obviously been microwaved which results in toughening up its natural soft baked texture. The cole slaw was mediocre and not particularly flavorful. ...  ... What a HUGE disappointment! Overall, this turned out to be one of the 2 worst pastrami sandwiches I've ever been served. I know that Capriotti's has now become another big multi-state franchise chain. I don't know how they managed to achieve that status by serving such a wretched sandwich.

REVIEW #215:  1 stars  (516 chars)
Ordered a cheese steak sandwich for pick up.  Good friendly guy took my order.  Got back to my hotel (Comfort Inn) good deal by the way, and tried my sandwich.  Totally overcooked meat.  Flavor good but definitely well,well,well done.  Called and asked   why and was told that meat was frozen and depending who cooked it you wouldn't know.  Asked for the manager and someone who sounded as if they were 15 years old said "I'm the manager"  and pretty much said what you ordered is what you get..  Would not do again.

REVIEW #216:  1 stars  (396 chars)
Service was great. Lady at the register was nice and even made my large order in a good amount of time. I got like seven or eight sandwiches for my associates.  ... Bread was soft. Ingredients were delicious. The only thing was when I took a bite into their Bobby sandwich, I felt something hard and it hurt really bad. I pulled it out and it was a very sharp plastic object. Check your sandwich.

REVIEW #217:  1 stars  (483 chars)
The sandwiches were good. The service was horrible. We placed an order at a location that wasn't this one... The wrong number was given on line. When we went to pick up order here... they made us go to the other restaurant to pick up the order at the other location. What kind of customer service is this??? We are on vacation... we had to get our car out of valet parking and drive to the other place. What was supposed to be a cheap and easy transaction turned into a total hassle.

REVIEW #218:  1 stars  (1114 chars)
While Capriottis is a convenient stop on the way to the strip from the airport or for UNLV students, I don't really get the popularity of this sandwich shop. For their signature sub sandwich "The Bobbie", they simply stuff a soft roll with shredded turkey, cranberry sauce, ice cold stuffing, and a crap ton of mayo. Go fatty America?! ...  ... While the roll is a better than average soft roll, I'd expect better tasting turkey to pair it with since with the skimpy amount of shredded turkey included, it tasted both salty and cold. The large amount of cranberry sauce with mayo didn't compliment it well either and the large chunks of cold stuffing just made the sandwich taste like something I threw together by accident on a drunk night. ...  ... I think the sandwich would of been far better if it was heated, but then again the heat would probably just mask the taste. People that go to Capriottis must really love having their stuffing cold or need a yearlong reminder what Thanksgiving tastes like. Perhaps the other pastrami special is better.  ...  ... Head to Earl's for a flavor explosion instead, imo.

5 stars for Capriotti's. 5 stars for service and food!! The people working there were very friendly!  ...  ... BF ordered the Capastrami and I ordered the Cran-Slam Club. Man, I bit into my sandwich and it was delicioius.. cold cut turkey/ham with cranberry sauce. I loved it from first bite! ...  ... But my first bite into the Capastrami was heaven. I broke up with Cran-Slam Club and I  began my new love affairwith Capastrami. Warm pastrami with tangy coleslaw.. Sigh. I will never forget you Capastrami!!!!

REVIEW #2:  5 stars  (513 chars)
A very interesting concept of samiches.... ...  ... Cole slaw mixed in with a samich? What? Yes, that is correct and  it's damn good!  The call it the Capistrami, oh sooo good n tasty, hot n cold, spicy n mild, ying n yang, ping n pong....u get the picture. ...  ... Another called the slaw-be-joe with roast beef.....haven't tried that yet.  The cheesesteak is good and the grilled italian, oh sooo gooooood. ...  ... I goota say this is the BEST hott samich so far in Vegas.....til next time, good samich eatin!

REVIEW #3:  5 stars  (531 chars)
I love love love love this location! The lady with the salt and pepper hair (I think) makes the BEST cheesesteak! I'm usually very satisfied with how they make their sandwiches. Sometimes I get disappointed because the cheesesteak is too dry, or not enough cheese. I guess it just depends on when you go, and who makes your sandwich. The service here is way better than the other locations. I stopped going to the location by my house because of their poor service. This store is one of the reasons why I love this neighborhood. :)

REVIEW #4:  5 stars  (718 chars)
I was debating on what my last meal would be before I got my wisdom teeth extracted last week and I didn't have to think too long and hard.  Capriotti's has been a favorite of mine for a very long time... I strictly only order the Bobbie or the Philly.  Most times, I can't decide, so I force my fiance to split the sandwiches with me so I can have half of each!  ...  ... This location is the one that I frequent the most.  I always call my order in on the phone and can expect it to be ready for me within 10 minutes, so I'm in and out in no time.  I don't know what I would do without my Capriotti's fix.  My mouth is watering right now just thinking about it... only a few more days until I can have some (I hope)!

REVIEW #5:  5 stars  (664 chars)
The best sandwich in town! I can't make up my mind if I am in love with the Bobbie or just the turkey sandwich in general. The way the roast the turkey and then shred it, makes it is the best turkey sandwich ever! I used to live by this location and it is always clean and friendly. The service has always been consistent. I liked to go in on Saturday because the owners brother sure is easy on the eyes. But back to the food, the food is great and I like it when  I get to do a survey for the company because it's short and you get $3.00 off your next sandwich. I think the price is a bit high, but well worth it since I usually get the 12" and eat from it twice.

REVIEW #6:  5 stars  (814 chars)
This is a travesty! How does this fine establishment not have 5 stars? ...  ... I'm also not happy with this whole Bobbie obsession. Yes, the Bobbie is amazing. I will not dispute this. However, the unsung hero of this menu is the Cole-Turkey. You can disagree with me but you'd be wrong since this is my review.  ...  ... Turkey, Provolone, Thousand Island, and Coleslaw = Delicious! ...  ... What? Are you going to go to Subway? That place smells like an actual Subway. Quizno's? Pshhh... their bread may as well be cement. These guys have the formula down. The bread is awesome, they hand pull roasted turkey (I've seen them doing it in the back) and everything moves quick so it's nice and fresh. ...  ... All those who oppose this gem of a sandwich shop are only dishonoring yourselves and your entire family.

REVIEW #7:  4 stars  (819 chars)
9 in. Bobbie is $8.65 including tax.  This is such a great deal for thanksgiving in a sandwich! ...  ... The cranberry, mayo, stuffing and shredded turkey are just to DIE for.  If you haven't had the Bobbie, you haven't lived.  I remember first having a Bobbie in 2000, so I've been living for 11 years now. :) ...  ... The employees here are very friendly, the store is always clean and has the typical Capriotti's decor. The food comes rather quickly and for this location, I've seen it very busy, but always had a place to sit. ...  ... I like the fact that this Capriotti's is nestled into the shopping center where there are a lot of other food choices, including: Yogi's Teriaki, Long John Silvers, KFC, Taco Bell and Robertos. ...  ... This location is a winner.  The food is consistent and the value is awesome.

REVIEW #9:  4 stars  (996 chars)
How long have I lived in Las Vegas (6 years) and this is the first time I've tried Capriotti's!  My husband couldn't believe it! ...  ... We rolled up here for a early dinner one night.  When I was looking for the menu, I had no idea what I wanted.  Luckily, there wasn't anyone in line after me and the guy taking orders was super patient.  I asked about their Cole Turkey, which had russian dressing and coleslaw on it, but no one that worked there ever had it, so I took that as an answer of not to order it, haha! ...  ... So I ordered: ... *Homemade Turkey ... comes w/ provolone, lettuce, tomato, onion, seasonings.  I had all that and included pickles, mayo and mustard. ...  ... The turkey had wonderful flavor.  However, I didn't like how dense the bread was.  I actually tore off a lot of the bread as there was just too much. ...  ... *Hot Chicken Cheesesteak ... -no mushrooms.  My husband said he craves this! ...  ... Overall, not bad and a nice change from Subway or Jersey Mike's.

REVIEW #10:  4 stars  (130 chars)
I come here for the cheese steak, and quite frankly, I like that there's plenty of bread!...Oh boy, would I love to have some now!

REVIEW #11:  4 stars  (391 chars)
I like Capriotti's regardless of the fact that its a franchise. I love the Bobbie (as all the other fellow yelpers do) for the cranberry stuffing turkey goodness and the Capastrami with all its pastrami coleslaw yummyness. I definitely come here when I feel like a good hearty sandwich. I am always full after eating here, which for 7 bucks for a 9 incher, that's a pretty good deal I think!

REVIEW #12:  4 stars  (217 chars)
One of my favorite sandwich places.  I recommend:  The Bobbie (turkey with cranberry sauce and stuffing) and the Capastrami (hot pastrami with their special sauce).  The sandwiches are huge and very reasonably priced.

REVIEW #13:  4 stars  (323 chars)
The bobbie is always a great choice when you're in the mood for a sammy. But, their smallest size is 9" -- guaranteed to put you in a food coma. After eating that for lunch I just wanted to pass out. I wish their small size was only 6". That I could handle, but the extra 3" is just too much to take (that's what she said).

REVIEW #14:  4 stars  (433 chars)
There are very few vegetarian friendly sandwich shops out there, but Capriotti's is one of them. They have a handful of sandwiches made with faux meats. The sandwiches they make are also quite filling. Their small is a 9 inch sub, with a 12 inch, and an 20 inch sub rounding out the options. ...  ... Edit: I was recently informed that the faux meats that Capriotti's has are NOT vegan. Sorry if my previous review led anyone astray.

REVIEW #15:  4 stars  (103 chars)
You gotta try the bobbie sandwich .. It's like a fresh bite of thanksgiving .. Glad I found this place.

REVIEW #16:  3 stars  (103 chars)
Bobbie wasn't as good here as other locations. Bobbie with slaw was gross... Sloppy, wet, soggy, gross.

REVIEW #17:  3 stars  (321 chars)
Didn't try the Bobbie, but have had a couple other sandwiches from here and they are good, but nothing out of this world. They guy at checkout doesn't seem like a people person and sounds annoyed calling your name when your order is ready. Would eat here again if really hungry and there weren't other convenient options.

REVIEW #18:  3 stars  (169 chars)
Great standby sandwich shop ... Hot sandwiches make me a fan ... Very no-frills, fair prices reflect that. ... Bread, meats, and cole slaw was all tasty ... I'll be back

REVIEW #19:  3 stars  (371 chars)
I love their sandwiches but they are VERY over priced AND.... they do not have whole wheat bread.  They were definitely behind the times by not having a whole wheat bread instead of WHITE bread.  Every other sandwich place I know has whole wheat..  Fire House Subs, subway, port of subs, quiznos. etc.. ...  ... Come on Capriotti's get some damm whole wheat french bread.

REVIEW #20:  3 stars  (444 chars)
I've been to a bunch of different Capriotti's Sandwich Shop locations, and this one is just okay. The service was slow and the veggie cheesesteak, which I love, was just okay. I think the bread was a bit on the old side. Also, there are no restrooms, and I really hate that!  I don't want to walk to another restaurant to use their facilities.  I don't understand how zoning laws in Las Vegas allow a restaurant to function without a rest room.

REVIEW #21:  3 stars  (583 chars)
My coworkers kept on raving about this place so I had to go check it out. Maybe my tastes are just different, but I was not all that impressed. Apparently the place has won awards for it's Thanksgiving themed turkey sandwich, which I got, but I found the sandwich to be passable - nothing spectacular.  ...  ... Food was decent, service was so-so, and I think everything was a tad overpriced. ...  ... I mean if you're tired of the normal chains like Subway, Quizno's, etc... going to a "mom and pop" shop like this one may break the monotony, but this one is actually a chain too...

REVIEW #22:  3 stars  (397 chars)
Standards are great when it comes to franchises.  You expect a certain product and as long as that happens younger satisfied so this place is a no brainer.  You always get what you are expecting.  My only issue with this spot that causes my average rating is I think the prices are too high. Lower the prices and I would come more often and give you more stars but price does play into my ratings.

REVIEW #23:  3 stars  (364 chars)
went on a tuesday, 11:15a.  waited 9 minutes for a bobbi sandwich ... ($6.50+tax).  the person before was getting fustrated when he went up to pay.  seems like he had waited a while too.  the register had gone down.  pay by cash only said the cashier.  as for the sandwich, was a nine incher, shredded turkey with cranbery sauce.  was good.  i may go again, maybe.

A couple of days ago I noticed their new sign on the side of the building that says: 'Now Delivers'. I told my husband and we called in today.  ...  The guys first response: "We usually only deliver on $50 orders but I guess we could do it for $30." He then told my husband 'wait a sec' then proceeded to holler back to a co-worker, "You feel like doing any deliveries today?".  ... Excuse me??? Um, shouldn't this be an everyday thing if your establishment offers it?  ... I guess he was fairly OK in attitude but seemed inconvenienced / stand-offish the whole time.  ... I'm all for some companies not wanting to deliver but if you advertise it, employees should be a little more accepting of the fact they're going to have to do it.  ... Furthermore if its a $50 minimum, shouldn't you mention that in your ad? I would figure you'd be fielding alot of unnecessary phone calls with such a vague listing. I don't know if it's just me but I believe there's alot of miscommunication and maybe some retraining that needs to be done at this establishment.  ... On a slight up note; the delivery guy was a pretty nice and friendly guy. His co-worker needs to take notes.

REVIEW #25:  2 stars  (789 chars)
As Capriotti's go in general, they are amazing. Delicious food, friendly service. This one...not so much. I've gone back several times and so has my boyfriend and the service here SUCKS. When I went last week, I walked up to the counter and had two employees look at me and then go back to their respective jobs. No "Be with you in a minute," or "Welcome to Capriotti's." They just looked at me. Then, when someone came to take my order, still no welcome, just, "What can I get ya?" Getting a thank you from someone there is like trying to get cake away from a fat guy. They're the only Caps to screw up my order too which is hard to do when I'm the only one who has ordered a sandwich. Yeah, I go back because it's close to home, but really, you're better off to go to the one on Rainbow.

CAPRIOTTI'S!!! Y U NO get my order right?? ...  ... I came to this location for the first time today and ordered four sandwiches. Two of the four came out right. ...  ... My sister is boring and she likes her sandwiches with almost nothing on them. I am the opposite. I like my sandwiches Primanti's-style--filled to the brim and only edible if you kind of tilt your head sideways and gnaw at them. So, you can imagine my sadness when I got home and my sandwich turned out to be the vegetarian version of my sister's (turkey, cheese, lettuce.) It was a mere ghost of what a sandwich should be. I even asked for pickles and of course, there were no pickles. :( ...  ... The other issue is that I asked for wheat on my sister's sandwich. Maybe there was a communication problem, since the person who took my order handed it off to someone else. ...  ... On the plus side, my sandwich was good (at least the "meat" was correct!) and the employees could not have been nicer. Capriotti's sandwiches are so good that I'll keep coming back despite service issues (until I find a replacement.)

I needed a pastrami sandwich.  I first went to Quinzo's to learn they no longer have pastrami on their menu.  So luckily I have an app on my G1 phone and typed in pastrami and this place came up.  Before I walked in an employee who was outside on a break greeted me.  Inside the other staff were very friendly and patient.  I seem to breakdown when it comes to ordering my food.  So I ordered: a small pastrami on a roll with extra mustard, and swiss cheese.  They only carry white bread.  The meat wasn't that great.  It wasn't great quality for the price.  They have specialty sodas for $2.19.  I got root beer which was pretty tasty.  Because of the customer service, If I'm ever in the area again,  might stop back to try something different.

REVIEW #28:  2 stars  (212 chars)
Service at this location has been sub par every time I've been. I've also been a few times when their hours say they should be open only to find they've closed early. In short, food is good; service, not so much.

REVIEW #29:  1 stars  (1150 chars)
Can I give 0 stars?  No?  Ok, then I will give my review of this awful location I decided to give a second chance, because everyone deserves that, and was reaffirmed that this is an extremely poorly run business. They definitely need a lesson in CUSTOMER SERVICE!!  First of all a couple years ago I was diagnosed with Celiac and needed to be on a gluten free diet. I was still craving the Bobby and so I ordered it just with no bun. I was then told they don't sell turkey by the pound, I needed to go to a deli for that. Awful thing to say to someone who has a disease and still wants to put money in your pocket!  Turns out I do not have Celiac and am no longer gluten free. I figured enough time had passed, noticed the entire restaurant store front covered in an advertisement that they deliver so called I did. "I would like to place an order for delivery."  Response, "Um, no."  "I thought you deliver?"  Response, "Let me ask my manager...  I'm sorry but no we aren't delivering right now."  Well you may want to take the giant advertisement that you deliver off your windows!!!!  Way to "deliver" on your own business model!!  BLACKBALLED!!!!

REVIEW #30:  1 stars  (324 chars)
My 4 friends and I were disappointed today when we drove over 10 miles to your sandwich shop on Fort Apache. We arrived @ 7:25pm and the shop was closed! The store hours say open until 8:00pm and there were at least 2 employees inside but no one would let us in. We ended up going across the street  to Arby's. Major bummer!

REVIEW #31:  1 stars  (220 chars)
Was not happy. Ordered a Cole Turkey. The meat was dry, the cheese bland, and wayyyyy to much cole slaw. It was if I ordered a cole slaw sandwich with cheese topped with shredded turkey. Did I mention the turkey was dry?

Capriotti's is excellent in general.  This location (in the Santa Fe Station Casino) is even better than most.  That's surprising considering that the casino smoke wafts right into their eating area.  But, the food is excellent, there's more seating in a less cramped environment, and we can buy refillable glasses of soda pop (our stand-alone Capriotti's only has bottles).

REVIEW #2:  5 stars  (391 chars)
The Bobbie sandwich is worth the hype. If you like Thanksgiving (which you should cause you're a patriot reading this) then you'll dig this sandwich. They made the sandwich in, no bs, 1 minute or less. I had just gotten my drink filed and it was ready. The manager was working the register and he was very courteous and professional. If you have a chance to get one of these wiches, GET IT!!

REVIEW #3:  4 stars  (803 chars)
Tucked away in the Santa Fe Station food court, Capriotti's seemed like the best choice of all the food options there. I usually go back and forth between the Bobbie and the Capistrami, and this time, I wanted a hot sandwich so I got a Capistrami before going to the movies. The combination and contrast of the hot pastrami combined with the cold slaw and russian dressing makes this an addicting sandwich that you take one bite after another until there is no more! ...  ... I ended up sneaking the other half of my sandwich in because we weren't keeping track of time and didn't wanna end up with junk seats, That was a great sandwich, and I prefer that any day over a bucket of outrageously priced popcorn with that fake butter...ALOHA!!! ...  ...

REVIEW #4:  3 stars  (695 chars)
I love Cap's; when I ate meat my favorite sub was the Slaw and Roast Beef, and the Bobbie is great of course :) But not only do they offer great meat subs, they have Vegetarian ones too!  ... They use a soy based sub for their veggie subs, and it tastes really good. I got the veggie version of the roast beef and slaw sub, and my dad got the Bobby. ... I was disappointed to see that they skimped on the soy turkey, so it was essentially all slaw. The Bobby was perfect though, so it just seems like they skimp out on the veggie subs at this location.  ... They also have a soda fountain that is accessable by patrons, so that's nice- you don't have to ask them for a refill, just get your own.

REVIEW #5:  1 stars  (498 chars)
Wow, worst food at a sandwich place. I ordred a plain Roast beef with mayo  and got old beef sawdust on a stale bun.  I  like Cap pretty much. This location is the dregs. They should be ashamed to be open. I usually do not write to a company to complain but I made a exception in this case. I hope they listen. Avoid this location at all costs. I think it may be one bad apple, but it can rot the bunch. Never rated the other locations I have been to, just took for granted that they had good food.

"Thanksgiving in June..." ...  ... Dude.. Why is everyone keeping this place a secret from me? They know I jones for a good sammich. They know I need my sammich fix. And they know how I get down after Thanksgiving Day, cause leftover turkey is the business. So today I didn't feel like eating pre-sliced and pre-stacked lunch meats served to me, and others, like we are in an Elementary School Cafeteria. So I went here with the expectations of it being similar to a Jersey Mike's or something. As soon as I read the menu, I was like "Wait!!!... REAL Turkey??"...I didn't go with the Bobbie.. I went here on lunch, and dozing in a 2pm meeting is just not cool... So regular one for me with ALL the fixins. First bite and I'm trying to get to the kitchen so I can Hi-Five the little lady breaking down 15lb BUTTERBALLS all-day. She deserves a gold medal and a sticker... Needless to say, I was very satisfied.. So lose the process meats and come here instead.. Cucumbers don't belong on a sammich anyway.. And I'm going back tomorrow to try a Hot Sub...

Best sandwiches in Vegas.  This site always makes sure my order is made exactly how I want it.  They get a bit busy at lunch, so calling in or ordering online ahead of time is a good idea.

Boyfriend and I were starving during our trip to Vegas and I looked up Yelp for a good sandwich shop. I didn't want to go someplace we have access to in CA. The guy who took our order was really nice, everything came out perfect, and was delicious. Not very expensive, very filling. Will definitely go back the next time we're in Vegas!

Cuz a foot isn't long enough!!! ... http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/1bALsE6aZE23mGV2WPxN_g?select=anOeubumuKq8jHiIMbHi3w ...  ... I had my first taste of the Capistrami in Vegas and was so excited they opened a location in Beverly Hills, but after coming to this new location, i am reminded that i still like the set up in Vegas the best.  ... It feels alot more family run and friendly here. ... Place your order first with the cooks, grab your drinks out the fridge and chips to munch on, and pay at the register. Be generous and give them tip for their Beer Fund!  ...  ... I've enjoyed the Bobbie and the Slaw Be Jo, (the philly is too spicy for me), but i still love their Capistrami the best. This time we got a 20 inch of that, and 12 inch roast beef Slaw Be Jo. They have tastykakes here, which i have yet to try and i love their potato chip selection.  ...  ... If ur tired of buffet gorging or don't have enough money left to keep splurging, and had enough of Sonics, I def recommend trying their pastrami!  ...  ... * about 7 min from the strip a little past the Palms

HOMEMADE TURKEY SANDWICH. I cant even describe how delicious this sandwich is. Make sure to mention that its your first time there and you get a FREE BROWNIE!!!

REVIEW #8:  5 stars  (308 chars)
I decided to try this place because I was looking for a good sandwich.   Looking at all the reviews everyone said to try the Bobbie.   I'm glad I listened to all the reviews because the Bobby was a great delicious sandwich.  I'm from San Diego and just found out they have a location near my house.   WOO-HOO

REVIEW #9:  5 stars  (243 chars)
I guess this place is somewhat of a chain. One of the best turkey subs I've ever had! Pulled turkey that is flavorfull and tender. Many other options, even vegetarian options. As opposed to whats on the strip, this is your snack destination...

REVIEW #10:  5 stars  (153 chars)
I love this place. I crave the capastrami wayyyy too much. I recommend you sandwich lovers to dine here. Worth it! ...  ... The service is great as well!

REVIEW #11:  5 stars  (372 chars)
I will never go to another sub shop if there's a Capriotti's within driving distance.  Quality food, quick and efficient service, and courteous staff.  My favorite is The Bobby (light on the mayo) and I salivate as I'm thinking of it.  Today is Memorial Day and the husband's cooking steaks on the grill but I secretly wouldn't mind if we just went to Capriotti's instead.

REVIEW #12:  5 stars  (838 chars)
I'm going to take it on faith that the bobbie is just as good or better than the sandwiches I've tasted here - the capastrami, the philly cheesesteak, and the slawbejoe.  And all three of those are top tier.  ...  ...  And among the three, the Slawbejoe stands out.  It's got to be one of the best variations of a roast beef sandwich I've had. The meat was tender and flavorful, and the cole slaw and Russian dressing complemented it nicely.  The capastrami is the same deal except with pastrami, still A-1, but the combination just worked better with the roast beef.  I normally not a philly cheesesteak person, but here, the steak is juicy and flavorful, and it's got just enough of a kick to it for me to enjoy it. ...  ... The portion size match the prices, and the taste goes above and beyond.  If I lived in Vegas, I'd be a regular.

REVIEW #13:  5 stars  (310 chars)
I'm obsessed with Capriotti's. I never really liked to eat sandwiches but after eating here I am officially a sandwich fanatic!!! I eat here about once a week and order something new each time. My favorite is the Philly Cheese steak with grilled onions (Soooo good). It truly is as good as it gets! Perfection.

REVIEW #14:  5 stars  (281 chars)
If you go in, get the BOBBIE. Major props to Mick who made our sandwich. The guy is a wealth of information about hiking through California and totally took the time to point out some must sees on our drive up through Yosemite.  Take the time to talk with him, you won't regret it.

REVIEW #19:  5 stars  (1308 chars)
My go to sandwich shop on my trips east I go for GENO's in Philly. My go to sandwich shop on the west coast now is CAPRIOTTI'S!!! My best friend who has lived in Vegas most of his life, swears by this sandwich shop, so I decided to stop by on a recent trip to Vegas from Los Angeles. Having never been there I researched their menu and the Bobbie always seemed to pop up in every conversation. When I got there I wasn't in the mood for turkey so I got the next best thing the Capastrami: hot pastrami on what seems like a french bread type loaf, russian dressing, and coleslaw ...  ... There are different sizes and that will determine your price: you can order a small (9'' about $5-7 bucks I believe, medium (12'' about $6-9) , or large (20'' i believe about $12 or so) ...  ... I was hungry but I wasnt HUNGRY so I decided on the medium size... ...  ... Sandwich: The capastrami was AWESOME! The creamy coleslaw paired with the slight natural saltiness of the pastrami was AMAZING. The russian dressing was just an added plus. ...  ... Got a side of chips and an bottled ice tea. The chips were just ordinary bag of chips went well with the sandwich.  ...  ... Learned they opened a location closer to home in Beverly Hills, CA ...so can't wait to go as matter of fact planning a trip for thursday hahhaa.

Ta-ta-ta-tastyyyyyyy!!! If you want a stellar, tasty, affordable lunch to nurse that 'party-too-hard-the-night-before' feeling...you MUST try Capriotti's.   ...  ... The spot is clean and staff is super friendly, though it's a little off the beaten path it's worth it! I highly recommend the 'Bobbie' &/or the 'SlawBeJoe'

REVIEW #22:  5 stars  (394 chars)
This has got to be one of the best sandwiches I have had in a long time. I had this for lunch while visiting Vegas on a business trip and wanted to go back for the same sandwich for dinner. I ordered the Bobbie and wow it was like Thanksgiving rolled up into a great sandwich. The sandwich consists of Thanksgiving style hot turkey, stuffing and cranberry sauce. Awesome concept for a sandwich!

REVIEW #23:  5 stars  (223 chars)
This is probably one of my favorie sandwich places. I've only had it twice but I'm coming back for more! Make sure to try the Bobby. It's literally thanksgiving turkey dinner on a bun. Cranberry, pulled turkey and goodness.

REVIEW #24:  5 stars  (919 chars)
This place has actually turned me on to sandwiches! Capriotti's hands down is one of the best sandwich places in town!   ...  ... Even if you get the smallest sandwich they are huge and well packed with goodness.  They have a good variety of sandwiches and each one I have tried so far I've loved like the Bobbie, with real shredded turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce and mayo.  Taking this sandwich home and toasting it up a bit in the oven is a must do.  ...  ... I learned that they cook 6 birds a day, and this year the day before Thanksgiving they cooked 11 birds and were out a few hours before closing.  I was the second to last Bobbie...phew!  But this was the case at all locations so again "One of the best sandwiches in town"  Among my other favorites are their cappastrami, Italian, and the vegetarian sandwich.   ...  ... Dine in our take home either way you are sure to enjoy one of their great selections.

REVIEW #25:  5 stars  (549 chars)
This place is soooo gooood!  So, me & a couple of my buds are strolling around the outlets in Vegas around noon and we get hungry.  What to eat?  We want to get something not too filling cause we're gonna get our grub on at a prime rib joint later on that evening (see prime rib restaurant review).  My friend Albee thinks of the perfect place (he knows about good food).  Capriotti's Sandwich Shop!  We all order the cheesesteak and it's tasty!  The rest of the menu looks good too; I can't wait until I get to go back and try the other sandwiches.

REVIEW #26:  5 stars  (678 chars)
When you are starving for a sammich you want capriottis! The food is real not like those corporate sandwich spots. I would say this is one of my top five favorite eateries of Sin City.  ...  They have a grill so there is a hot and cold menu. They are vegetarian friendly both hot & cold options. I'm pretty sure the bread is made on site. The Turkey is really good. However, It's their specialty sandwiches that make this place remarkable. I love the Capastrami. It's more or less a Reuben on hero (grinder, sub, whatever you call it.) bread. My girlfriend likes the Bobbi (sp?) it's thanksgiving on a sub, complete with the cranberry sauce.  ...  You can't not love this place!

REVIEW #27:  4 stars  (131 chars)
Banged out my order with a quickness! Good sammies and we'll be back. However, the guy at the cash register was a bit of a rooster.

REVIEW #28:  4 stars  (253 chars)
Capastrami, Capastrami, Capastrami! ...  ... A local chain that is decent. Tried other items including SlawBeJoe and The Bobbie, but those were not as good as Capastrami. ...  ... Also, small is the new large here. I always order small and can't finish.

REVIEW #29:  4 stars  (1108 chars)
Capriotti's sandwich is made with great tasting meats with added salt to enhance the flavor. Be careful, if you don't respect the sandwich you'll get addicted to it like I did when I first tried it. ...  ... Bread options are slim to none, maybe that's because I don't specifically ask for it but you usually get the white bread. ...  ... Inside of the sandwich is just filled with tasty meats but are a bit salty, but you can't really notice it. It gets you right underneath the tongue. The meats are of higher than average quality and you can really taste the vegetables.  ...  ... Texture is soft and easy to consume ...  ... Experience of it is worth the try but can get busy at this particular place, so call ahead if your hungered. Take it easy capriotti's won't be going anywhere with it's great tasting sandwiches. ...  ... The desserts they offer is mediocre, I can get a similar cake at a liquor store.  ...  ... I got the Chicken cheese steak with mushrooms, other times I get the regular cheese steak. The Cran - slam club is an experience worth eating for, a sandwich that's out of the ordinary.

REVIEW #30:  4 stars  (549 chars)
GOBBLE GOBBLE ...  ... If you're ever yearning for some thanksgiving food before thanksgiving definitely try this spot out and get the "bobbie" ...  ... Turkey, Stuffing, and Cranberry Sauce in a sandwich. It was very flavorful and was definitely a good hang over food lol oh plus if for someone you feel a little lazy call them up they deliver.  ...  ... The 20'' inch subs are good for 4 people but even after that you still want another..thats how good their sandwiches are. I will definitely come back when I get back to Vegas. Peace Yelp Heads!

REVIEW #31:  4 stars  (374 chars)
Great food but not a great location. The sandwiches are great, for east coaster's they have Tasty Cakes, and the service is pretty prompt - but the restaurant is just so SMALL. I came in with four friends and had to stand for 20 minutes for a table to clear out. We left one table to grab our sandwich and another patron swooped in and took it! My advice is to get it to go.

How do you know when you in a real East Coast kinda sub shop?  When you open the door and all you smell is vinegar!  YUM!!!!   ...  ... I had the pastrami sandwich and it was delicious-quality meat, good bread!  What more can you ask for? ...  ... Will I come back?  Hell, Yes!

REVIEW #34:  4 stars  (614 chars)
I had heard great things about Capriotti's, so I really wanted to go, because I heart sandwiches! They have a strong menu of favorite's and some more innovated things. I had the Bobby, which has really shredded turkey (not deli sliced), stuffing, and cranberry relish. This is something I wouldn't necessarily choose, but I heard it was really good. I was pleasantly surprised at how much I liked it. The stuffing was delicious, and the turkey was waaaaay better than deli turkey, and the cranberry added the perfect touch ( if I had it again I would have added brown mustard b/c that would make it a 5 in my eyes)

REVIEW #35:  4 stars  (856 chars)
I hate it when you go to a sandwich shop let's say for example subway and they skimp when constructing your sub. Once upon a time a friend of mine worked at subway and I did not know it was physically possible to put that much meat in a sandwich until he manned the counter. Ahhh good times and Capriotti's keeps the good times rolling. ...  ... Shared the  12' Capastrami and seeing as I was extremely reluctant to order a sandwich with a large amount of cole slaw I can say that I was thoroughly converted by the Cap. The meat was plentiful and the combination of the pastrami and cole slaw was superb. ...  ... As I suggested they really load the sandwich and give you a bang for your buck. ...  ... Biggest drawback is it's no where near the strip out in no man's land. My friends and I dropped by upon leaving a none of your business weekend in Vegas.

REVIEW #36:  4 stars  (323 chars)
I have eaten a Capriotti's a couple of times now. The sandwiches are very good. I have had the Bobbie and the Capastrami. Both are delicious. Capriotti's is a good cheap dining option while in Vegas. Even though it is a little off strip it is worth the drive. I enjoy picking up a sandwich each time I visit the Vegas area.

REVIEW #37:  4 stars  (271 chars)
I love the 3 sandwich size options here, and the eggplant sandwich was quite tasty.  Vegetarian options are always a plus for our large group of people, so everyone had something they liked in our large order.  This place has just the right vibe for a good sandwich shop.

I love this location. The food is great( try the chicken cheese steak!) and the staff is friendly. The guy that makes our sandwich is awesome! He remembers my bf and I when we come in..think his name is Justin...anyway the only reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because they leave their tables dirty, other than that.everything else is good!

I've only been to Capriotti's on a hand full of occasions, but I do enjoy them more than most chain sandwich places in town. The service has always been friendly when I stop by and although they are a little slow, the sandwiches always come out tasty.  ...  ... I'm not a fan of the infamous bobby, but I always end up with one of their hot sandwiches or turkey. I do wish they have more toppings to choose from like avocado, but for the most part, this place is a good spot for a quick food fix and the sandwich sizes are ridiculous.

REVIEW #41:  4 stars  (633 chars)
If I was basing this review on my last sandwich, I would give them 2 stars. But I usually love Capriottis so I gave them a pass. ... I usually get turkey or italian or ham and cheese. Well I got a Cheesesteak, I've heard all of this raving, and haven't had one from Caprriottis in years. Yuck!, thats not a cheesesteak! It has big chunks of meat, like they chopped up the meatballs or a cheeseburger. No sir I don't like it. It wasn't even good if they would've named it something else. I'll stick to what I like, no more Caps Cheesesteaks for me. I'll go to Caps for their Yummy Turkey. And go to Pops or Geri's for my cheesesteaks.

On Sundays "Great Boa" is not open (missed that memo), so I was left trying to find a quick lunch before heading to the airport.  Luckily Capriotti's was nearby and completely empty.  It was like 1pm and I ordered a 12" Capistrami with no cheese.  Delicious!  The pastrami was tasty but not overwhelmingly salty.  The slaw, and I'm not usually a fan of slaw, was light and sweet and crispy.  And the Russian dressing was not overbearing but made the whole thing creamy and juicy.  But the best part of the sandwich is the bread.  I really liked the spongy soft roll - it's not like a typical flaky roll that breaks apart when you bite in.  I'm happy to report my sandwich stayed together until every bit of it was in my belly.  Oh, and half of the sandwich filled me up great, and I ate the other half at the airport hours later.  Not a bad way to spend $9.50 at all!

What took me so long to finally try Capriotti's?  I'm not sure why it took so long for our paths to cross, but as fate would have it, we had an office Thanksgiving party and I was fortunate enough to meet the Veggie Turkey. ...  ... For Capriotti's in general: ...  ... I am highly addicted to Capriotti's at the moment.  Which is odd because I'm not usually a sandwich type of girl nor do I particularly care for fake meat.  Something about this particular sandwich, however, has me got hooked. ...  ... The bread has a nice little crust on the outside while still being soft and chewy.  The toppings are always fresh.  There is a perfect balance of ingredients- not too much lettuce (like most places will do) and not too skimpy on the "meat" and cheese.  The sweet peppers?  They have opened me up to a whole new sandwich experience.  I l-o-v-e me some sweet peppers. ...  ... The employees are super friendly and I can't recall any problems with any of my orders.  Plus you can sometimes get $3 off your next order if you get a survey on your receipt! ...  ... I've also had theVveggie Cheesesteak and it really wasn't for me- too much fake meat.  It tasted fine I just couldn't handle that much fake chicken.  I think it would be a really good sandwich for someone who is a newbie vegetarian. ...  ... My only gripe with Capriotti's is that they don't offer free water.  I think it should be required that every restaurant has free water for their customers, but unfortunately that's not the case.  I really, really hate paying for an overpriced bottle of water. ...  ... For this particular location: ...  ... The employees are great and they are pretty fast with my order.  The store can get pretty messy though and there aren't a lot of places to sit down and eat your sandwich.  It's probably best to just pick it up from here and eat elsewhere.

Wow, I'm so excited to have found a really good veggie cheeseburger. I know right? A veggie burger at Capriottis? I was scratching my head too when I saw this on the menu. Didn't even know this was on there. But I'm thrilled that I got it because I've had veggie burgers at other places and none of it were as good as this one. What I loved so much about it was that it didnt fall apart so easily and it wasn't bland at all. I had Justin add some grilled onions, mushroom, tomatoes, lettuce, cheese, and mayo and ketchup--all that in between the kaiser buns and it was veggie cheese burger heaven..yum. It was also pretty big for a small order so I saved the other half for later. Also a bonus: the price! It only cost 4.50! Plus the service was, as usual, awesome! One thing though that stil needs improvent was the cleanliness of the tables. It just needed to be wiped down more. There were crumbs and grease left over from previous patrons. Other than that, everything was gravy!

You can never go wrong when it comes to the quality of Capriotti's sandwiches.  Excellent customer service, food is prepared in a timely manner and it tastes great!

REVIEW #54:  3 stars  (437 chars)
Apparently they are known for their pastrami which was good and their thanksgiving turkey sub. that was w.e, Cranberry jam or something on the sandwich. These sandwiches sucks when they are cold and they get hard. (no pun intended) It was a decent meal, 20 inch sandwich for like 11.99 or 12.99 The pastrami was pretty decent but when in Rome, do as Romans and go all out and get something better =] Not bad if you're on a budget though.

REVIEW #55:  3 stars  (763 chars)
Cute little sandwich shop behind the McDonalds on Decatur & flamingo, small but still kinda cozy, the people that work here are cool and friendly. I got a small meal (the Bobbie meal) so the price was cheap... they don't have sprite, coke, Pepsi, just Mountain Dew & 7up. They don't have any 'name brand chips' here either which isn't a big deal at all to the norm but if your a foodie like me... I like to have my variety of flavorful chips. I wanted to see what all the buzz about the Bobbie was about, I liked the combination of cranberry, stuffing, turkey, & mayo (because you can't even taste the mayo) but it honestly wasn't a wow factor. It was a good meal with okay prices, next time ill bring my hot sauce bottle.  ...  ... P.S. they don't carry avocado.

REVIEW #56:  3 stars  (330 chars)
I had a Capastrami sandwich today. It was really really  tasty. One thing that I hated about the place is that its not comfortable for eating there. The thing with Jasons Deli is that the place itself is really cool and one can go with friends or family. Not with Capriottis.  Athough the food is superb, you have to take it home.

REVIEW #57:  3 stars  (190 chars)
Large portions. Took a long time to get my sandwich and little seating at the shop. Definitely a call-ahead place. ...  ... Had the grilled italian. Great flavor! Would definitely get again.

REVIEW #58:  3 stars  (88 chars)
Love the sandwiches, wish that they would put mash potatoes and gravy on the Bobbie!!!!!

REVIEW #59:  3 stars  (1185 chars)
My sister already warned me to expect the sandwich to be cold because the first time she ate it, she was expecting a hot sandwich. We ordered The Bobbie, which is basically a Thanksgiving dinner in a sandwich: turkey, stuffing and cranberry sauce. It was good and wish I had more cranberry sauce in my portion. The sandwich would get 3.5 stars. ...  ... My reason to round down: I came with a group of 7 and half of them had to go to the restroom. We claim two tables to sit and I was at a table that sits two, thinking no one else would sit at the other chair because I'm here. Not true. You would think if someone is sitting at a table, you'll find a different spot or at least ask if he/she can sit there. Well not in this case. This guy just sat down and his friend was standing between us. I didn't really care to begin with because I'm thinking they're just waiting for their to-go orders. Nope. They got their orders first and started eating at the table I claimed. The guy standing placed his sandwich in front of me (although, I had my back to them) like it's his spot. WTH... So when it was our turn to eat, we had to hold it in our hands while those two jerks got the table.

REVIEW #60:  3 stars  (407 chars)
We came here for a quick bite before leaving Vegas after reading the rave reviews, but I must say it's a mistake to come after eating at Earl of Sandwich the day before. I had the highly rated Bobbi but didn't think anything special of it (probably because it was cold). We were the first ones there after opening but it still took a good 20 minutes to get our sandwiches. Going to Earl's instead next time!

REVIEW #61:  2 stars  (980 chars)
I always make a point to visit this restaurant when I come back into town, but I normally visit a different location. That said, I will not return to this location again. ...  ... I wasn't greeted for several minutes and after many attempts at making eye contact with any of the 5 employees behind the counter. After I ordered, I walked over to the register to pay (no one else is in front of me at this point). The guy behind the register didn't say a word but looked at me and walked back, not to return for about 5 minutes. Another customer was behind me and equally confused - we decided we were supposed to wait until our food was ready to pay. Eventually the guy came back and I got my food a few minutes later. Overall, it was an awkward and annoying experience that I have never had at any other location.  ...  ... The only reason I gave this location 2 stars was the food itself. They did get it right and it was amazing as usual. Get the slaw-be-joe and thank me later.

REVIEW #62:  2 stars  (170 chars)
I think the guy behind the counter was new. He had to ask me what I wanted three times and my name twice and still got it wrong. I will not be returning to this location.

REVIEW #63:  1 stars  (785 chars)
Disappoining, rude to kids. Heard great things, lots of great reviews, and recommended by people I trust, but not somewhere I will go again. Employes were disinterested and barely short of rude when helping us.  Ordered turkey (dry), pastrami (indistinguishable from the cole slaw dressing), and grilled cheese for our 2 kids.  The crack head taking our order said no problem, but when they rung it up they charged us for 4 full sized sandwiches. I'm not cheap, but $5 for plain grilled cheese? Sandwiches were big, but bland and lacking in flavor. Seem more interested in quantity than quality, and their seating is insufficient. Employees look like they are all on parole, and interactions mimic what I imagine a prison cafeteria line to be like.  Will not go again, do not recomend.

REVIEW #64:  1 stars  (242 chars)
This place was not at all what everyone talks about. Bread tasted old, too much mayo , old lettuce, turkey was odd looking! Terrible!!! The only happy person there was the cashier, the guy taking orders seemed like he hated life! Never again!

REVIEW #65:  1 stars  (192 chars)
This was horrible. I've never waited 20 minutes for a STUPID SANDWICH!!!! 2 dudes behind the counter and it was 25 minutes from the time i walked in til the time i walked out, not busy at all.

Best sandwich shop in town!!! Ordered the Cole Turkey - turkey breast, cole slaw and russian dressing on soft, fresh rolls.  Coworkers got a bobbie, a cheesesteak and an Italian and they raved about them too. The small is huge - for a small eater, you can split it into two meals and be stuffed after each half. ...  ... Every town in America should have a Capriotti's!

REVIEW #2:  5 stars  (248 chars)
Bobbie and the Capastrami are to die for!  I love this location because they've always been so friendly and speedy.  Unless the college is in session, it's pretty empty.  So if you want great service, awesome food made quickly, visit this location.

REVIEW #3:  5 stars  (881 chars)
Bro and I each got the cheese steak with xtra mushrooms and xtra sweet n' hot peppers. If this is even possible, I think this was the best Capriotti's that I've had. The cheese was melty, bread soft and warm, peppers were hotter here! Our sammies were perfect. Medium is plenty big enough for lunch and will keep you full most of the day.  ...  ... Note to Capriotti's corporate: Keep your current meat supplier! Do not change! (Little birdie told me you're wanting the franchisees (?) to change...) Look at Toyota - that's what happens when you change what works in favor of trying to save a buck. You change your meat supplier to corporate meat, quality declines, customers Yelp that your sammies start sucking. How many times do you need to see it in other industries, let alone with food we inges?! Just don't do it. Keep serving us the same high quality meat you're known for.

REVIEW #4:  5 stars  (1239 chars)
Cappriotti's is my go to place when in doubt. They have so many choices, even with their simple set up. It's a lot more unique than other sub places, just because of their meat. You can sense the difference after one bite. I feel like it's just better quality, it's either that or the "shreddedness" of it making it easier to munch on. Either way I can't go wrong when I come here. ...  ... My personal favorites are their turkey, steak and cheese (I love it with onions and peppers, real spicy!), the Bobbie (when I really want to let it all go lol) and their sandwiches instead of their subs. ...  ... Be careful when you order, a small is quite enough to feed one person. Medium can feed two. And a large can feed a small family! ...  ... This particular store is good, I really feel the family vibe and the workers are really laid back. I always give them a tip since it goes to their "beer money", and I respect the honesty. ...  ... Keep in mid though, their subs are a little bit more pricey than other places but I classify then as "quality over quantity". ...  ... Overall, whether your driving by or planning on going out of your way.. Cappriotti's is a good place to choose for a sub other than the 'robotic' subway or quizno's.

Forget the alcohol, I would come to Vegas just for THE CAPASTRAMI and THE BOBBIE.

REVIEW #6:  5 stars  (47 chars)
Great place, they even have vegetarian options.

REVIEW #7:  5 stars  (690 chars)
I came here last Tuesday to buy my mom one of Capriotti's signature BOBBIEs. It honestly couldn't get any better than it already is. For $6.60 + tax, you get a 7" sub of pure goodness. My friend first introduced it to me a couple of years ago "It's basically a thanksgiving meal!" she said and I have been hooked on the Bobbie ever since.  ...  ... The staff in this branch was friendly and the cashier saw to it that everyone was given personal treatment. He was very polite and courteous, definitely a personality that would keep customers. I liked the idea of black and white checks to surround the walls and floor tiles, It gave the place more character and made it feel more authentic.

REVIEW #8:  5 stars  (223 chars)
I can't count how many times I have eaten here. I left Vegas a few years ago and every time I visit, I make sure I eat here at least once during my stay. You can't go wrong with a capistrami or a bobbie. Both are delicious.

REVIEW #9:  5 stars  (576 chars)
I've always been a big fan of Caps. I don't think i've ever had a bad sandwich from this place. And the fact that they make your sandwich to order there is no getting cold or "old" food.  ...  ... This location was decent service was good and the food came out quickly. My cheesesteak sandwich came out piping hot and full of flavor. Everything was melded together perfectly with the peppers, onions, meat, cheese and mushrooms.  Wasn't very busy so it was nice and quiet and we were able to relax and enjoy our lunch! ...  ... if you've never been here before try the Bobbie!

REVIEW #10:  5 stars  (313 chars)
In my experience Capriotti's is a five star sandwich place. As much as I could ask for in a sub/salad type place, good staff, good product. My go to is the Bobby, and it's amazing, but I've even branched out to try the salads and they were quite satisfying as well. I always highly recommend Capriotti's for lunch

REVIEW #11:  5 stars  (527 chars)
Now I know there are multiple locations here in Vegas, but this one is the best!  I always order the philly cheesesteak with mushrooms and you have to get the hot peppers, I wanna know where they get them!  This location is clean, the staff are super friendly and their tip jar says beer money, love it! Went in today for my weekly fix and as always, the meat cooked well, love the fresh bread and of course the hot peppers.  The staff member who rang me up (he might be the owner) gave me a $3.00 off coupon for my next visit!

REVIEW #12:  5 stars  (350 chars)
Quick friendly service and the yummy sandwich creations!  My fave is the Bobbie!  It's thanksgiving dinner in a sandwich!!  Cold turkey slices served with mayo, stuffing and cranberry sauce. Delicious!!! Although it may be even better if the turkey and stuffing were served hot.  The smallest is a 9"!  It's a lot of sandwich!  You need to go hungry.

REVIEW #13:  5 stars  (396 chars)
The only complaint I could have against this and any other location is that I've been going to Capriotti's for 4 years now and I finally got a survey thing for $3 off! Capastrami is my go-to sandwich, but bobbies are great too just have to be in the mood for one. The service is exceptional, and the location is super convenient. Just a walk across the street when I work and attend class at CSN.

REVIEW #14:  5 stars  (684 chars)
Vegetarian turkey sub.  Holy crap.  The best sub ever. ...  ... The boy and I stopped at this location on our way back from a hike at Red Rock Canyon.  We were both pretty hungry but still ordered small subs, which were more than enough.  Half of a small would have been more than sufficient for lunch, but I ate the whole thing because it was so damn tasty. ...  ... They also offer vegetarian cheese steak subs, which sounds pretty interesting.   ...  ... Oh, and the boy got a regular turkey sub and was impressed by the freshness of everything and that it was actual turkey, not processed slices. ...  ... When in Las Vegas again I will definitely be making a trip to Capriotti's.

REVIEW #15:  5 stars  (1371 chars)
When I first moved here in Vegas, I saw this sandwich shop so many times on my way home. It was almost like my guide home. So, I started thinking maybe this is just Vegas' version of Subway. Oh, but never in this life time will it ever be compared to Subway. My friends took me here after church. Apparently you have to eat after church, cus it just completes the service. ...  ... All I kept hearing was, "Try the Bobbie", "Try the Capastrami." I am more of a hot sandwich person so, I went with the Capastrami. It was the greatest decision I've made at a sanwich shop. Kinda makes me wish I made great decisions like this throughout my life.  ...  ... So, anyway about the sandwich.. It was this prefect hot, juicy pastrami that laid on a cold bed of some kind of coleslaw. With this peppery Russian sauce to top it off. I always get extra russian sauce on the side. This sandwich always satisfies my hunger everytime. ...  ... I tried the Bobby another time. It is a cold sandwich, but it's unique. It's basically a thanksgiving lunch. It has the turkey, bread stuffing, cranberries and cranberry sauce.. It's just as good as the capastrami. ...  ... I also tried this sandwich called eggplant Parmesan. It's absolutely filling for a no meat sandwich. So much flavor. Now I ave yet to try the rest. ...  ... They also sell tastykakes! Those deliciously moist krimpets.

REVIEW #17:  4 stars  (1480 chars)
An office favorite.  One of the many locations in the Las Vegas Valley, but this one is more memorable to me than the others I've visited.  More on that later. ...  ... Capriotti's is a sandwich shop whose slogan is "Quality is our only gimmick"  and they have proven that to us with every visit.   We have yet to get one bad sandwich out of the bunch, and we have ben getting lunch here at least once a week for the past two years that I have been working for my company.    ...  ... Some of our favorite sandwiches include ... The Bobbie - aka Thanksgiving dinner on a roll.  Shredded turkey, Cranbery sauce and Stuffing and Mayo wrapped in the bread of your choice. ... Capastrami - Hot Pastrami, Cole Slaw, Russian Dressing and Swiss ... Mushroom Cheese Steaks ... Sweet Italian Sausage with Sweet Peppers ... And what we lovingly refer to as the "Joe Pesci" which is a Small Italian with extra peppers. ...  ... These are not your average skimpy subs, the small rolls are 9" and the large are 20" and they are fit  to bursting with all the goodies. So make sure to bring your appetite! ...  ... But my favorite reason to go to this specific location is, depending on how much of a tip you leave them, they show their gratitude by yelling out either: " BEER MONEY!  or BIG BEER MONEY!!"  Either reaction is cool, but it's always fun to hear "BIG BEER MONEY!"  I won't tell you at what amount beer money becomes BIG beer money, that's up to you and your generosity to find out.

heard a lot of good things about this place unfortunately the closest to me is in las vegas. since i was in vegas i dropped by for a sandwich to go and decided on the capistrami. i thought it was a 8.5 out of 10. The bread was the best part of the sandwich. the pastrami was tasty but i've had better. that's not saying i wouldn't go here again because i absolutely will. good thing that i just found out there is one now in my city of torrance. i will be trying that one shortly...like as in tomorrow!

REVIEW #21:  4 stars  (208 chars)
I might move back home just to eat Capastramis on a regular basis.  ...  ... Picture a hot pastrami sandwich with provolone and some kind of insane Russian dressing. Hot? Yes. Add orange creme soda and voila!

REVIEW #22:  4 stars  (1061 chars)
They have many locations in Vegas and some in other states. I've never dined in and always get food to-go or delivered.  I've had the Capastrami, Bobbie, Cheesesteak, tuna, homemade roastbeef, Italian, meatball sub and veggie cheesesteak (just out of curiosity). I also get their grilled cheese sandwich which has at least 4 slices of cheese.  At the counter, they have Tastykakes - if you're from the East, you know the yummy goodness I'm talking about. ...  ... There are 2 things I used to dislike: tuna sub and salt & vinegar chips. But for some odd reason, when I tried eating these together, I was pleasantly surprised.  Their tuna isn't fishy, the mayo isn't overpowering and the onions are not overwhelming. Then you have salty tangy chips...mmmmmm... ...  ... But what really makes this place a must-try is their BOBBIE which is Thanksgiving in a sub sandwich.  It has stuffing, cranberry sauce and of course, turkey.  It sounds a bit strange when all eaten together but believe me, it is delish! So, if you like Thanksgiving, you will like the Bobbie.

REVIEW #23:  4 stars  (460 chars)
This Capriotti's is a very well run location. I never have any issues whatsoever. They are quick, courteous and professional. I love their cheesesteaks, but their turkey is also really good. Plus, they carry Wise chips! They are typically hard to find in this town, unless you go here or the Bagel Cafe. They are my favorite chips from back when I lived in New York. The honey barbecue are awesome! If you like Capriotti's, this is definitely a solid location.

REVIEW #24:  4 stars  (240 chars)
This was my first experience at a Caprio this and I must say it was a great one. I got their famous Bobby sandwich which is just like a thanksgiving dinner if you've never heard of it. It's reasonably priced for how good the sandwiches are.

REVIEW #25:  3 stars  (880 chars)
Ate here for the first time over the Thanksgiving weekend.  The menu is small but there is probably something for everyone.  I planned on getting the Bobbie since that is what everyone raves about but when I found out it was a cold sandwich that kinda turn me off.  I ended up with the cheesesteak sandwich.  The sandwich was pretty good.  Hubby had a tuna sandwich and he said it was just like a big subway sandwich (he likes subway but I'm not sure that was a compliment).  Drinks are bottles so no refills.  The service was fast and friendly.  This location had a terrible sewage oder in the dining room that was even stronger in the bathroom.  It made eating much less enjoyable than it should have been.  I would rate the food 4 stars but will remove a star for the horrible stench.  When I go back next time hopefully the smell will be gone and I can bump the star level up.

REVIEW #26:  3 stars  (584 chars)
First timer here. ... I rank it three stars because: ... I've had better Italian subs. ... The price was way high for just a sandwich without being in a combo. ... the cold veggies on the bottom got warm and soggy under the hot meat. ...  ... It was still pretty good, and if it weren't for the coupon that printed out, I might not ever go back! ...  ... I have heard of this place being famous for the Bobbie, but I don't like that whole thanksgiving sandwich thing. Don't care much for sweet with my salty in a savory type of meal.  ... Maybe I'll try something different next time.

REVIEW #27:  3 stars  (284 chars)
Forget Subway, go here instead...Try "The Bobbie" it's like Thanksgiving Dinner in a sub! The Italian sub is pretty tasty too...get extra mayo though, because their subs are kind of dry.  The subs are huge too, its enough for lunch and dinner.  It's a carb. blowout waiting to happen!

Rex is a tough guy...a real man's man...better...he is a real Rex's man. Most men know they can never be Rex...and all women know they will never be with anyone as good as Rex. It is a burden. It is a curse. Rex bears the mantle for what all men should be. Tough. Strong. Virile. Always has a rag, some gas and three pills found in Gary Busey's house.  Still, there is another side. A sensitive side. A side that has a heart.  Rex weeps when he sees pictures of fat girls who was one thin. Rex sobs uncontrollably when he sees a puppy...eating out of a dumpster...and there is none for Rex.  Rex wails and throws himself to the ground at the mere thought of Jessica Alba's sweet babies...how they have ruined her once beautiful vagina.  He is human. Rex IS human...no matter what the Slovakian courts may say. ...  ... Today...this day...January 45, 2193...Rex weeps again.  Sadness has washed over Rex...much like the time he found out that his girlfriend wasn't just smelly...she had died 38 days earlier. Damn you paint thinner and Pine Sol...why do you have to be so much fun with such an evil side.  Granted Rex is not as upset as when Judy... Jenny...Jana...whatever her name was expired...this time Rex doesn't have to throw out his couch. Still Rex is upset.  Why do you ask?  DON'T EVER ASK ME A QUESTION AGAIN YOU PATHETIC FREAK!!!  Rex will tell you at his own time...okay...Rex is upset because another love of his...is dead.  Capriotti's Sandwich Shop is dead to me.  Rex has actually eaten Capriotti's years ago back east. Rex decided to leave where he was staying...by hiding under a laundry truck and going through two gates, swam through a river, wrestled a rat the size of a large dog and survived in Wilmington...which was the hardest part.  During his brief, but highly publicized change of address he ate at a Capriottti's. It was excellent. Perfect sub. Inventive. Quality ingredients. Care. Pride. It was a taste sensation. A revelation. ...   ... That was a long time. A long, long time ago. Now...now Capriotti's is basically Subway but a few notches better...but not nearly as good as it should be. Especially considering the price differential between the two. Such a shame. Total shame.  It would be easy to change their ways, but the chain is now owned by a corporation so the traditional corporation changes are taking place.  Less meat. Lower quality ingredients. Substantially less overall care and dedication to the craft which is sandwich making. ...   ... Rex went and bought 2 subs for the first time in about 9 months.  Rex bought the Cole Turkey and the Bobbie.  The Cole Turkey Rex hadn't bought in 3 or 4 years.  The turkey was dry. There wasn't enough of it. There wasn't enough sauce. It was a total mess. Lots of cole slaw because it is cheap.  The Bobbie...my beloved Bobbie has been absolutely destroyed. Heavy on the stuffing light on the turkey, too much mayo and not enough cranberry sauce.  Rex is a good man...a great man...a fair man...a well hung man...and he tried the best sub. The Capastrami. That is when things went wrong. Rex stood up and attempted to defecate out the horrible food. Rex screamed..."I AM GOING TO CRAP THIS CRAP OUT OF MY CRAPPER!"  Everyone else screamed...melee ensued...Rex was escorted out...for those who are interested...mission accomplished. ...  ... This location is no better or worse than all of the location. It isn't an individual store issue it is a systemic issue because of the change in ownership.  Rex wants to love Capriotti's. It is what the world needs...a great chain that makes incredible subs/sandwiches with care and quality. There just isn't one out there.  Firehouse comes close (review to come later) but there isn't a perfect one. ...    ... Now the expended menu with salads, etc will only water down the brand and quality further. They could have spent more money to buy meat in bulk at a lower cost so they could more on their sandwiches, like they used to have. No. They use their purchasing power to buy lettuce. Really? That is corporate thinking...bad thinking. ...   ... Rex will always be what you want him to be. Incorrigible. You will always be what Rex wants you to be. Gullible.

NASTY NASTY NASTY sandwich.  Pulled turkey on wheat.  I think our cat eats better food than this.  I don't know what all of the hype is about., but the sandwich I had was a waste of money.  The DRIEST turkey.  Seriously - like someone rolled the meat up in a paper towel and squeezed every last bit of moisture.  Oh, and the chick who made it looked like she was still wasted on something from the night before.  Ugh, that probably had something to do with it too.  I should just stick with Subway when I'm away from the yummy delis in the SF Bay.

Yay!! We have a new sandwich place at Town Square and it can't get better than Capriotti's.  The little sandwich shop is located in the old spot of Jonny Maguire's.  When you walk in, you can swear it's the same restaurant as not much has changed in the set up except the big board menu above the kitchen and ordering stations.   ...  ... The staff is super friendly.  They seemed to be as excited as I was to be there, and I hope that time does not take away that enthusiasm because I genuinely appreciated the sincere friendliness.   ...  ... I walked in at about 1pm on a Tuesday and there weren't very many people in here.  This is disturbing because I would HATE for them to suffer the same fate as Johnny Maguire's.  I'm hoping once more people realize they are here, they will come.  Build the sandwich, and they will come.  ...  ... Anyway, I ordered a small (9-inch) turkey with all the fixings.  In my excitement I had forgotten to tell her I was a mall employee, but to my pleasant surprise, she made sure to ask me before finishing the transaction.  I got a small discount, which I truly appreciated.  Then I waited for my sandwich.  The employee who was making sandwiches called out a couple other people's names and then saw that I was standing there still waiting.  He asked my name, and 2 minutes later my sandwich was ready, and to my surprise, a large instead of the small I had ordered.   ...  ... The best part of all of this, how freakin delicious my sandwich was!  What a pleasant experience.  I'm so excited and I hope they are here for the longrun!

I learned about Capriotti's when I was here in 2012 for the Yelp Elite Spring Break event.  I spoke to one of the owner reps and he gave me a free sandwich card for me to use the next time I come back into town!  Sweet! ...  ... When I did eventually go back later that year, I lost the card(doh!) but I still went to get a sandwich here.  Personally out of all the sandwiches I tried, I personally like the Bobbie the best which is turkey, cranberry, and stuffing.  I also had tried the Capastrami and the SlawBe Joe which was pastrami and roast beef respectively.  However, both of these sandwiches have cole slaw in them...not a sandwich that can keep for a couple of days.  I ate half of the Bobbie the day I ordered it and ate the rest the next day without refrigeration.  Still tasted good!  Any sandwich that can taste as good as the day you bought it, wins oodles of points in my book.   ...  ... This location in the Town Square is very convenient and located upstairs from the Coffee Bean.

I've wanted to try Capriotti's for a long time but every time I'd pass by a Capriotti's both here in Las Vegas and in Southern California, I'd eaten a meal a short time before.  Finally, the timing was right and I got to try their famous Bobbie sandwich: turkey, stuffing, cranberry, and mayo.  Looked kind of dry but was really good.  The turkey wasn't salty, the stuffing was tasty and had a nice texture, and the bread was really good, even though I don't usually like white bread.  There seemed to be too much cranberry (not usually a fan) but I was mistaken.  There was just enough to complement the turkey and stuffing.  Will definitely return to a Capriotti's on my next trip back to the mainland.

If you are a Cap's fan, this location is great. There is a location by my area on Rainbow and 215, but Johnny and I drive the extra mile to come here because I am in love with their sugar cookies. They're so soft, chewy with crispy edges. The people are nice and friendly too. ...  ...  One time, I ordered a chicken cheese steak to go for my boyfriend when he wasn't with me and they accidentally made me a regular cheesesteak. No problem. They apologized and I waited for the right order. I didn't realize until I got the chicken cheese steak that they insisted me to keep the other one for free because they made the mistake. Now that's customer service.  ...  ... I personally like cheesesteaks, but when I'm in a refreshing type of mood, Capastrami for me please.

REVIEW #9:  4 stars  (363 chars)
Located on the same level as the Movie theaters.  I'm actually getting myself the black an bleu salad.  I get to try Jesse's sandwich that's why. Lol. ...  ... Small little shop, great service.  It's a small simple menu so that every time you go to Capriottis you can try each one.  I'm a Bobbie or Capastrami girl! Oh an hey have nothing Bundt cakes too. Yippie!

REVIEW #10:  4 stars  (507 chars)
New location in Town Square, across from the movie theater. Sandwiches are great just like any other Capriotti's locations and the employees are fast, efficient and friendly. If you've never been to a Capriotti's before, I would really recommend the Bobbie or the Capastrami...which are my favorites. It was hot outside and Capriotti's seemed to have their AC turned up much higher than other stores that day. Loved it since it was really refreshing...also caused me to stay there longer than I had planned!

REVIEW #11:  4 stars  (464 chars)
The cole slaw is in-flipping- believable!!! ...  ... We had never been to a Capriotti's before, so we gave it a shot. The woman behind the counter wasn't exactly friendly and definitely not helpful after asking if it was our first time there. I got the vegetarian turkey something or other and it was meh to say the least. The very best thing about the entire experience was the freaking cole slaw! I will go back, just to have a cole slaw sandwich. NO JUDGING. :)

REVIEW #12:  4 stars  (124 chars)
Three cheers for the Capastrami!!!  Location is a bit tough to get to but if you're already in town square it's no big deal.

REVIEW #13:  4 stars  (1598 chars)
Well this is a place that despite its oddly arranged seating and small space is going to do well at Town Square. I honestly cannot remember what was here before Capriotti's, but can we really remember many of the unmemorable, poorly thought out, and down-right bad places that have opened up at Town Square? The place seems cursed, save for Yard House. BUT I believe Capriotti's WILL survive, if only based on the fact it is a chain that delivers good food and it is a name that will have people flock to it no matter what. ...  ... I happened upon Cap's while I was shopping today and had two things in mind. 1. Getting some food and 2. Escaping the heat. I wandered to Cap's and entered. The place is tiny and cramped. There is bar seating and a few tables. No matter how busy this place gets, it is not going to hold many people, but I've noticed that about a lot of Capriotti's - small places, limited seating. ...  ... I received the Capastrami (Small) and a small fountain drink, which I had to shimmy to the back of the place to fill up. There is room for exactly one person in front of the soda machine so be prepared to wait if the place is busy.  ...  ... My sandwich came out quickly and was delicious as usual. Cap's uses the finest meats and the best ingredients, that's why their sandwiches taste so good (save for a burnt Philly Cheese Steak I had once).  ...  ... If I'm in Town Square and need a quick bite, this will probably now be my go-to. The only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is again, the tiny space and the necessity to squeeze around people to get to the soda fountain.

REVIEW #14:  4 stars  (1075 chars)
While it many not have the glitz of the rest of the Las Vegas strip from the outside, Capirotti's serves some of the best sandwiches around. It is unfortunate that the first reader did not have a good experience, because I have only had terrific experiences. Capirotti's serves several great sandwiches, but the highlight of this place is a sandwich called "The Bobbie", which is a Thanksgiving feast of turkey, cranberry sauce and stuffing on a tasty sandwich roll. Other winners include "Slaw Be Jo" (roast beef, cole slaw, provolone, russian dressing, and mayo) and a tasty eggplant parmesan sandwich, which is one of many vegetarian choices. The only negative is that there are not a lot of places to sit, which can be a problem during the heart of the lunch rush. Service is friendly and prices run from about $6 for a small (9") sandwich, to $11 for a huge (20") sandwich which can be easily shared. I like to go with a few friends, get a few sandwiches and split them up. This is a regular stop for me when I am in town. Do yourself a favor and give Capriotti's a try.

First time at this location. Ordered my usual, chicken cheese steak... One word, DRY.

REVIEW #16:  3 stars  (459 chars)
I had to try "The Bobbie" after hearing people rave about it. I've never been overly impressed by Capriotti's and this sandwich was on par with the rest of their food; just OK.  ... I LOVE stove top stuffing. I LOVE cranberry sauce.  And I like turkey sandwiches.  So this sandwich sounded promising. Unfortunately it just wasn't anything special. I could definitely make this at home faster and cheaper. On the plus side the small 9" sandwich was pretty big.

REVIEW #18:  1 stars  (1366 chars)
I wouldn't come back. ...  ... This was my first time at Capriotti's and I am pretty disappointed because everyone tells me that it's the best sandwich they have ever had.. Me thinks not. ...  ... The cashier was completely ice cold towards me while I was ordering and only spoke to me wwwwwwheeeeeen: I finished ordering and gave her my card to swipe. When she handed it back and said nothing, I started walking away to sit down at a nearby table. Immediately, she raises her voice and says "HEY! YOU HAVE TO SIGN THIS FIRST!" Maybe it is because I have been in customer service for so long that something like this pisses me off, but that's not how you address customers. If it's a big deal, wait until the receipt is done printing, and THEN hand my card back at the same time saying "Will you please sign that receipt for me as well?"  ...  ... I ordered the Roast Beef without onion and added mayo. To my surprise, the roast beef was shredded.. I've never had it shredded before when I have ordered from other places? And the big bummer was that the roast beef was very very dry. The bread was okay, but it was on the colder side. I didn't know if I had the option for it to be toasted when I ordered or if it's served like this, but the cashier could have cared less.  ...  ... After my buddy ordered, he turned to me and said "That girl was such a b%$* to me!"

Capriotti's makes the best damn sandwiches. Bobbi, Italian, or Philly FTW.  ...  ... This location is setup a little different than others with their counter but I've never had a problem with service.

REVIEW #2:  5 stars  (1030 chars)
Is it possible to be in love with a sandwhich? I think so. I can't say one bad thing about Capriotti's. I used to be strictly a Subway girl (I know right!!) Before my fianc convinced me to try Capriotti's,  abd I'm so glad he did! ...  ... Everything tastes super fresh, and delicious! My favorite has to be tge steak abd cheese with the hot peppers, mushroom, and a little bit of mayo (it makes the hot peppers not so hot) I've also had thd Italian which was my go to sub before the steak and cheese. Salami ham provolone cheese on a fresh soft slice of bread you can't go wrong!  ...  ... You also have to try their signature sandwhich the "bobby." As I like to call itbits Thanksgiving in one sandwhich!  Roast turkey, stuffing and cranberry sauce! Absolute heaven! I know this review if for this Capriotti's on South Rainbow, but I have never had a bad experience at any of the Capriotti's that I have been to! If you are visiting,  a local forever,  or a newcomer to the valley you must try Capriotti's!  You won't regret it!

REVIEW #3:  5 stars  (255 chars)
Very impressed with this location. It was Very clean when walked in and smelled great. The staff acknowledged us immediately. We ordered The BOBBIE!! It was so delicious. We will be back it only takes us 10-15min on the freeway to get here. Well worth it.

REVIEW #4:  4 stars  (164 chars)
Great food and great service. Not a place you want to eat in but you can. It's more of a take out place. ...  ... The Italian and the Capistromi sub is my favorite.

REVIEW #5:  4 stars  (577 chars)
I've been to many Capriotti's in Las Vegas and this one was basically the same as the rest. Good service, yummy food. Someone started to order before us when we were there first and the person who was taking our order told the customer to wait because we were there first. I thought that was very nice of him and showed that he valued us.  ...  ... Got the bobbie this time! I loved it but I have to admit I missed the bits of crushed pepper that comes on their regular subs. I think next time I will have to ask them to add it on top of the sub. It's just to good to not have!

It's capriotti's.  Decent sandwiches, very few good brands of chips, sterile restaurants. I'm just not totally faschnickered on this place and never have been, but it's okay. I might never crave capriotti's but I'll definitely eat here again.

REVIEW #9:  2 stars  (593 chars)
Service at this location is not as good as some other one's. I walked in and waited at the counter for maybe 5 mins. I was staring at the girl behind the counter either she didn't see me and was too busy with her current order or didn't care. At least acknowledge the fact that I'm there waiting for someone to take me order! A quick 'hi I'll be right with you' would have been nice! Also I order a mushroom cheese stake with onions and lettuce. It was a to-go order so once I opened it I found no lettuce....fail. It was my first time at this location but I was not impressed with this store.

Always solid!  We visited Capriotti's the other day and ordered the same-ole same-ole.....cheese steak sandwiches.  My boyfriend always gets the cheese steak sandwich with onions and peppers and I always get the chicken cheese steak with onions and hot peppers....with a side of mayo and a little salt....Dangalang!  Always fresh, always consistent.  Sadly enough I could eat this everyday.  The small sandwich is more than enough and its so good you cant put it down.  But I must admit that once you devour this amazing sandwich you will be ready for a big fat nap and to stretch out yo belly. ...  ... On a side note the employees are so nice.  Don't forget to tip them because it certainly is amusing hearing them all say "Beer Money" when they dont even look old enough to drink.  hahah

REVIEW #3:  5 stars  (306 chars)
capriotti's has the best sandwiches!   ...  ... my favorites are the bobbie and capastrami.  the bobbie is like thanksgiving dinner in a sandwich.  what's good about the capastrami? um, everything!   ...  ... i can't go without having capriotti's when i'm in vegas.  i frickin wish hawaii had at least one.

REVIEW #4:  5 stars  (210 chars)
Excellent sandwiches.  3 out of the 4 times I've gone I've had the Bobbie.  Had a steak and cheese once, but I definitely prefer Thanksgiving on a roll.  May as well try things that you can't get anywhere else.

REVIEW #6:  5 stars  (575 chars)
I am in LOVE with the Bobbie. It is my new favorite sandwich in the world and I crave it all the time! ...  ... Oh wait, I am reviewing the place here. Umm, this location is nice and clean and quite and service was good. They made the sandwiches well and quite quickly. ...  ... Only sandwiches I order here is the bobbie (a new discovery for me but will be all i get from now on!) and the cheesesteak which I usually order as a mushroom cheesesteak and sometimes add peppers and ketchup. Yum! Great hot sandwich. ...  ... There are so many locations around Vegas, I love it.

REVIEW #7:  5 stars  (898 chars)
I don't know why I don't go here more often, but I guess it's a good thing as it's the type of thing you could (maybe) get burned out on.... Or I fear the BF will get burned out on it, but my love of Thanksgiving sandwiches will still be on fire.  ...  ... It's not in a busy shopping center, so I don't think a lot of people know it's there, at least I didn't until I searched for one specifically by the house.  ...  ... They have various kinda of sandwiches, cold cuts and hot, but I stick with turkey based sandwiches. Turkey is one of those weird guilty pleasure comfort foods I have so naturally get the Bobbie, and sometimes the Cole Turkey. The BF gets Bobbies or Capastramis. I did try the vegetarian turkey at a event once, and I would be hard pressed to realize that isn't meat. ...  ... I hear much about their cheesesteaks, and maybeee one day I will bust out my routine and order one.

REVIEW #8:  5 stars  (81 chars)
I love their cheese steak subs. If you want a cold sandwich, try the cole turkey.

REVIEW #9:  5 stars  (1130 chars)
I've seen them around town but took me so long to actually try it. Definitely one of the better sandwich chains around for sure. Felt like a small unfussy family owned shop....it doesn't feel "corporate". ...  ... I love shredded turkey sandwiches every style possible, but no sammy shop does it, and I can't  commit to roasting a turkey to make a friggin sandwich. Leftovers is why I love Thanksgiving so naturally I love the Bobbie here....shredded turkey, cranberry,  stuffing, mayo....mmm.  ...  ... Went with the 2nd best seller too to try the populars first. Capastrami was pretty good, but I can never shake my loyalty to Langers in Downtown Los Angeles.  ...  ... Shared the 2 sandwiches with the BF and it was soo filling we still had a piece leftover for a snack so definitely they don't skimp on the fillings. ...  ... Next time I'm going to try to Slow Be Jo and the Cole Turkey- I love slaw and russian dressing sandwiches!  ...  ... Definitely glad I tried it, just sad it took a while since I thought it was just another deli cut place like Subway or Port-o-Subs. A fan for sure, simply because it's roasted turkey.

REVIEW #10:  5 stars  (287 chars)
Meat and veggies are fresh, service is great, prices are reasonable and sandwiches are HUGE! ... My favorites are the bobby and the cole turkey. (Capastrami is uber great, too!)  ... Another nice thing is that they will hollow out the hoagie roll for you if you don't like so much bread.

REVIEW #11:  5 stars  (510 chars)
mmmmm yummy sandwiches here.  I decided to stop by because I was starving and there was nothing else around.  This was my first time here so I decided to play it safe and order the grilled italian (small).  It was soooo delicious.  The salami was a little on the spicy side for me, but it tasted very good.  I ordered the small one and was only able to eat 1/2 of it.  I grabbed a menu on the way out and plan on being back to try the other flavors. ...  ... Price wise it was not bad the for the portion size.

REVIEW #12:  5 stars  (231 chars)
Oooooh the Pastrami is the best!!!  I get a craving for this sandwich!  It's a little  on the pricey side, but I believe they use quality meat and the sandwiches are HUGE!   ...  ... You try it once, you'll be back again and again!

REVIEW #13:  5 stars  (257 chars)
Really good sandwiches, the bread is fresh, the meat tender, and the spicy peppers will kick up any sandwich. I will continue to eat here, it taste like a great New York Deli sandwich and not like the other sandwich shops with the gross meat that taste wet.

REVIEW #14:  5 stars  (391 chars)
The Bobbie is the greatest creation known to man. Being that there are like a million locations in las Vegas, this has to be the best one in the north west area. They are very friendly and are quick to greet anyone who walks through their doors. I've never had any problems with food or service at this location or any other for that matter. This is a truly classy sub spot for a good price!

REVIEW #16:  5 stars  (509 chars)
This is a great family owned sandwich shop franchise. All I their sandwiches are good, but their specialty selections are amazing. The Bobbie is amazing, and like thanksgiving dinner on a hoagie. The Cole Turkey, Slaw-be-joe and Capastrami are also amazing. I'd frequently order a large, get it cut into thirds, and have a delicious meal for later. You can call ahead and pick  up the food for later. They also let you get party platters, and the folks at work were always impressed when I bought Capriotti's.

REVIEW #17:  5 stars  (373 chars)
This particular store is always very consistent and the workers are extremely friendly.  Due to a Freudian slip, I accidentally ordered a large Bobbie for me and a large cheese trio for my wife and came  home with 40" of subs!  Oops.  Oh well, nothing like leftovers for the weekend.  It had been awhile since I had ordered from them so I guess I'm making up for lost time.

REVIEW #18:  5 stars  (461 chars)
Used to say Subway was my favorite sandwich place but Capriotti's has knocked Subway off its pedestal.  I put a lot of weight on the bread of a sandwich and their's is great.  Just the right amount of chewy.  Tried the Bobby once (very unique) and loved it but keep going back to a basic turkey or roast beef with lettuce, tomatoes, and vinegar and oil dressing with herbs.  Perfect.  I'm usually able to resist their gigantic brownies.  Aren't you proud of me?

REVIEW #19:  5 stars  (235 chars)
We have ate at Capriotti's several times and have yet to be disappointed.  The food is always fresh and good. ...  ... We hadn't realized that we walked in 20 minutes to closing time.  They didn't try to rush us out and were very nice.

REVIEW #20:  4 stars  (513 chars)
I have always been a big fan of Capriotti's for many years now. I am from philly and it's the closest you will get out here. The last time we went 3 of us split a cheesesteak,cappastrami and a bobbi. They all taste real good but the bobbi had so little turkey on it and seemed to be filled with stuffing. If this was my first time here it would have to get 3 stars but cause of all my others years of great sandwichs i just hope that this was just a bad sandwich maker and will give them the benifit of the doubt.

REVIEW #22:  4 stars  (701 chars)
I've been a fan of Capriottis since my first encounter with the 'Bobbie' at a catered work function. I have since grown to love the 'Capastrami.' It is an amazing sandwhich creation made with pastrami and cole slaw. The 'Bobbie' has turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce and mayo. I haven't had a bad sandwhich from this place, or any other Capriotti's in town. THe cheesesteaks are above par as well. The only issues I have with this chain are the lack of drink varieties and the price. I'm not saying it's not worth the price because inch for inch you're paying for quality meats and condiments. I just think that I would probably eat there more often if it didn't cost me $45 to feed my family of four.

I've been fatting down at Capriotti's Sandwich Shop ever since I set up camp in Las Vegas almost two years ago. Why do I keep returning, you ask? Because I consistently get a good sandwich without the awkward salad-tossing mongoloid named Jared. ...  ... The meat, vegetables, bread, and just about everything is PERFECT at Capriotti's. Even the service. The ONLY areas that keep them from a perfect rating is price and lack of side dishes. While I understand that I am reviewing a sandwich shop, it frustrates the hell out of me that you can't get a single side dish. ESPECIALLY when you already have stuffing and cranberry sauce (from the Bobbie) and coleslaw (SlawBeJo) for the sandwiches. ...  ... Capriotti's Sandwich Shop has a massive variety of just about anything you can put between buns (Take those nasty thoughts to the strip, people). With a great selection for EVERYONE, from us normal humans to you tree-humping vegetarians, there is a sexy sandwich waiting for YOU at Capriotti's! ...  ... PS - One important thing to note about Capriotti's is that the sandwiches/subs/whatever-the-hell-you-get are almost as good the second and third day (due to the greatness of the bread). Take notes, Scrubway.

REVIEW #24:  4 stars  (433 chars)
Second time here and I like it. Once is an oops, twice is a trend. No fuss no muss no hassle. Nice folks and good eats.  ... What's not to like. Okay, if you're a Coke nut you may have an ish but I'm all about the Dewbish so I'm good to go.  ... If Danny's working when you go in give him a fake name. He's a good sport about it. Not only that but you can tell he does damage to the menu when he's not behind the counter. Good peeps.

REVIEW #25:  4 stars  (262 chars)
The Bobbie is truly amazing!  Though I don't care much for the black & blue salad.  The staff is always friendly which is a plus :). It's great that they use fresh ingredients and they roast their own turkey, but just wish there was an option for a smaller size.

REVIEW #26:  4 stars  (763 chars)
This is a simple sandwich shop chain I'd wish to see all over Northern California!   ...  ... The Bobbie, their most popular sandwich, is not your average turkey sandwich.  With slow roasted turkey, fresh cranberry sauce, a layer of homemade stuffing, and mayo....it's like experiencing Thanksgiving anytime of the year!  One of my favorite cold sandwiches on earth.    ...  ... The Capastrami, their 2nd most popular sandwich, is packed with flavor!  I'm a huge fan of hot pastrami and this pastrami was damn good!  But I wish they had less coleslaw in the sandwich to accomodate more meat.   ...  ... Their enormous subs and quick and friendly service will expedite my return!  Gotta try the others I've heard so much about...the Capacolla and the Cheese Steak.

REVIEW #27:  4 stars  (327 chars)
This place has great food.  I'm vegitarian so its hard to find places to eat in Las Vegas.  Capriotti's has great vegtarian turkey sandwiches.  The staff works VERY hard and they are always very friendly.  It gets pretty busy halfway through the day but they are still very fast making sandwiches.  I would reccomend to anyone.

REVIEW #28:  3 stars  (479 chars)
I like coming here for their Chicken Cheesesteak with hot peppers to make it extra spicy. A lot of people like their Bobby which is a turkey sub with cranberry and stuffing. This place really has a unique menu which I love. It keeps me coming back. My only complaint is that the staff are young, but I haven't had any issues with them. I wouldn't pay by credit card here since their machine seems sketchy. The place looks like it REALLY needs a GOOD cleaning maybe it's just old.

REVIEW #29:  3 stars  (320 chars)
The sandwich was good, as I have come to expect from Capriotti's. The Capistrami didn't disappoint and the Mrs. was pleased with her Bobbie. This location doesn't offer fountain drinks, which was a bit of a letdown. Canned sodas are $1.00 and bottles are $1.80. The staff was pleasant and friendly enough. I will return.

REVIEW #30:  3 stars  (249 chars)
Used a CapAddicts coupon today Free Upsize to a 12' from a 9'...It felt like they used the 9' steak and put it on a 12' bun...Not as much meat as I've been accustomed to from Cap's BUT still Delish just left me wanting more (I know p.i.g. oink oink)

REVIEW #31:  2 stars  (307 chars)
Maybe I am missing something but I just didn't find anything special about my sandwich.  Maybe I was expecting more because of all the positive reviews at other locations.  Store was clean and staff was friendly but the sandwich itself was just a notch above a Quizno's or Subway.  I probably won't go back.

Best sandwiches.

REVIEW #6:  5 stars  (590 chars)
By far the best sub shop.  I haven't been to anyplace that had better tasting subs.  Just today I ordered a philly cheesteak with nothing but meat, cheese, and hot peppers and it was like an orgasm of the mouth.  The cheese was so melted into the spiced beef that it was almost like the beef was stirred in some sauce or something, hard to explain.  The peppers were hot which I loved.  I usually get the cold spicy Italian which is phenomenal as well, but today I tried something else.  Very happy with the service especially if you call it in ahead of time (no wait).  LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!

REVIEW #7:  5 stars  (791 chars)
I give this place 5 stars because it is by far the best sandwich shop of it's kind.  Subway and Port of Subs aren't even worth mentioning in the same breath.  The sandwiches are delicious and huge.  Unlike the other sub places, this place actually has a fair amount of meat and other items in between the bread.  Not like some places where you have to pay extra dollars just for enough meat to actually taste it.  For me, it's all abou the spicy italian, with lots of these tasty chopped peppers.  Sure it's not $5 to eat, but I would rather pay a few extra dollars and get a sandwich that is filling, and taste way better than all others.  There is a Subway pretty much in the same parking lot as my job, but I would rather drive a few miles down the road any day to get Capriottis instead.

REVIEW #8:  5 stars  (505 chars)
I have always loved Capriotti's and found they have the best philly cheese steaks in Vegas (and beyond).  ...  ... However, I decided to try the Tuna Sub yesterday and all I can say is WOW. Best Tuna Sub ever.  I never thought I would have to leave a great review for something as simple as a tuna sandwich, but after eating that one, I had to tell the world - lol. ...  ... So, I will continue to spread the good word about the great food at Capriottis and continue enjoying the best sandwiches in Vegas.

REVIEW #9:  5 stars  (201 chars)
I just had Capriotti's and their turkey with cranberry was one of the best sandwiches I've had in a long time. I hope a franchise opens up in Orange County, CA because I would be there every other day!

REVIEW #10:  5 stars  (387 chars)
My parents lived in Vegas for awhile and introduced me to this FANTASTIC sandwich place. Now every time I am anywhere near a Capriotti's, I have to go. I absolutely love the "real", Thanksgiving style turkey on it! No compressed mystery turkeyloaf here! The cheesesteaks are excellent too, just avoid the hot peppers unless you have a hankering to burn off a few of your tastebuds. YUM!!

REVIEW #11:  5 stars  (472 chars)
one New Year's resolution is to write more Yelp reviews, so here goes... ...  ... In Vegas for NYE & gave this place a shot per other Yelp reviews. I had the Capistrami & the girlfriend had the Cheese Steak, which I had few bites of. Both were absolutely delicious in an awesome-deli-sandwich-sort-of-way. The shop is no-frills with only some bar seating, but the sandwiches are really reasonably priced. So if all you're after is a fantastic deli sandwich, definitely go.

REVIEW #12:  5 stars  (178 chars)
The best cheese steak and pastrami sandwich in Vegas. this is a place for take out. They have a sitting area but its small and not to comfortable. But the sandwiches are great!!!

REVIEW #13:  5 stars  (888 chars)
The hype is real. Is this worth a $20 cab ride from the strip? Come on, it's just a sandwich. Let's not go crazy here... That being said, if you have a car/friend/etc, this place is incredible.  ...  ... What makes it so special? You know that slimy deli turkey meat stuff they serve at subway and well almost everywhere? They don't use that here.. they use real turkey that tastes like leftovers from thanksgiving. As everyone says, the bobbie really is thanksgiving on a bun. I thought stuffing, cranberry, and turkey would be kind of sick, but honestly it's incredible and you must try it. If you're looking for a sandwich place that's different than your everyday deli meat place, try here. The Cran Slam Club is also incredible (if you have a fear of stuffing or feel it doesn't belong on a sandwich), as is the cheesesteak if you're some freak that doesn't like thanksgiving turkey.

REVIEW #14:  5 stars  (505 chars)
The last time I went to Vegas was the first time I had Capriotti's. We had to go twice that weekend because it was so delicious. It's few and far between when you find a sandwich place that offers imitation meat for us vegetarian folk.  ...  ... The vegetarian philly cheesesteak sub is my favorite. The flavors are magical and the imitation meat they use is superb. The turkey sub is also very delicious, tastes a lot like a real turkey sandwich, comes with delicious veggies and served on a kaiser roll!

REVIEW #15:  5 stars  (320 chars)
With all due respect's to Jarred's July 1 review, I decided to test them and place a take-out order... Bobbie with extra mayo and cranberry. When I asked, they said it would be ready in 10 minutes. So, 10 mins later my sandwich was already waiting for me, (and well-made). Staff was cheerful and friendly. No complaints!

REVIEW #16:  4 stars  (264 chars)
Capistami Sandwich all the way!  YUM! ...  ... There's also a elvis look alike that works here - very entertaining. ...  ... Kicked back atmosphere inside.  Local magazines to browse while you wait to take out or eat at their bar.  (no alcohol served here though).

REVIEW #17:  4 stars  (194 chars)
Favorite Sub Sandwich shop in Las Vegas.  I like their turkey & stuffing & cranberry sauce sub sandwich.   Small seating area.  Take-out is better.  Mostly good folks working behind the counter.

REVIEW #18:  4 stars  (209 chars)
Had the HOT ITALIAN SUB (Genoa salami, ham and cappicola). The meat was piled high with pickles lettuce tomatoes and mustard. It really hit the spot. You can rely on this place to satisfy any sandwich craving.

REVIEW #19:  4 stars  (965 chars)
I am sure everyone has heard of Capriotti's but I have to add my two cents. Their sandwiches are so good, and a nice alternative to the chain sub shops. My personal favorite is the Bobbie, while my boyfriend always goes for the capistrami with double meat (ugh, why?). But here is my question, why are all of the staff beautiful young boys?! I have only seen one girl ever behind the counter at Capriotti's. The rest are these cute young things with a knack for making great subs, and girls sweat while they wait! I am in love and completely happy, but I am always begging my boy to go to Capriotti's. I think he is starting to catch on, but I don't care. Girls, Capriotti's has awesome sandwiches, and awesome eye candy while you wait...what could be better for lunch? (Caution: order in advance by phone, or you could get stuck waiting a bit...actually, this could be a good thing!) ...  ... Recommended sandwich: The Bobbie for a Thanksgiving-leftover-style sub.

REVIEW #20:  4 stars  (180 chars)
I love the Italian sub and the Bobbi's at Capriotti's. The sandwiches are huge and the meat is delicious! I always have the other half for lunch the next day. Check this place out!

REVIEW #21:  4 stars  (555 chars)
I'm so glad other people like the Capistrami here, I'm hooked on them!  Everytime we order them at work, I always get the Capistrami.  A lot of people don't like cole slaw, but I love it, and when it's on my sandwich, it's a win/win.  Their slaw is good typical, it's got a nice sweetness, but not as bad as KFC (whose slaw is just insanely sweet for no good reason).   The Capistrami is this-  Pastrami, Swiss Cheese, Russian dressing (1000 Island) and cole slaw.  It's simplicity in it's best.   And it's by far one of the best sandwiches I've ever had.

REVIEW #22:  4 stars  (211 chars)
In Vegas for 3 days, ate here twice and took 2 home! The Capistrami is outstanding! We also had  the Slaw Be Jo I think it was called? The meat was a bit dry, but the Capistrami and the service made up for it!!!

REVIEW #23:  4 stars  (275 chars)
Mmmmm, not usually a fan of coleslaw but theirs is good!! Went here 2-3 times and got the Capastrimi every single time. Now this is a sandwich that I can't finish since it's huge but it's delicious! I've only ate here when we have cars in vegas and when I'm not on the strip!

REVIEW #24:  4 stars  (217 chars)
Well, wouldn't you know, I just wrote a review and now I get to enjoy one!  Delicious, peppery/sweet, but not too sweet slaw.  Flavorful thinly sliced pastrami, just enough cheese and russian dressing.  I'm in heaven.

REVIEW #25:  3 stars  (133 chars)
All the workers seem like they were hungover and take 30 minutes to get a sandwich made wtf. ...  ... But the sandwich WAS good. haha

REVIEW #26:  3 stars  (234 chars)
Love this place, ordered a large italian, and a large steak and cheese. Very nice and fresh, hot and spicy.  ...  ... Little pricy but worth the money in my opinion,. ...  ... Order it for pick up. It was ready on time and good to go.

REVIEW #27:  3 stars  (408 chars)
My 2 favorites are the Mushroom Cheese Steak and the Cole Turkey. I would eat here more often if they would get different rolls. The French bread is horrible. We have even bought whole wheat rolls from the store and remade the sandwich. The Cole Turkey really does not need the Mayo as the Cole Slaw and Russian dressing are enough. A large 20" feeds 3 adults and is a great value. Please get some new rolls.

REVIEW #28:  2 stars  (335 chars)
1.5 - 2 stars ...  ... Yelp reviews say this place messes up your order a lot - didn't happen to me, however, it took the workers 15 minutes to make 2 sandwiches. ...  ... BF also says the grill was also yucky because it had a lot of junk on it. ...  ... Won't be back to this location due to service - but will be back to Capriotti's.

REVIEW #29:  2 stars  (632 chars)
Capriotti's is a very popular sandwich/sub shop in Las Vegas...  I have tried several locations and i do like their food... This location however, sucks my ass.  The steak sub was not filling as they usually are at other locations.  I asked for easy on the hot peppers, well they kinda over did it, completely making the sandwich un-edible..  Perhaps the saying easy on the hots, is beyond their comprehension. Their staff, what a bunch of tools...Food may be decent but the service, to me is a key factor in eating at a restaurant even if it is just a sub shop...  I recommend Capriotti's but not this location...   Hope this yelps

REVIEW #30:  2 stars  (734 chars)
It took like 20 mins for my sandwich, I asked if they had cappacola and they had no clue what that was... kinda strange but whatever. I didnt understand why it took soo long for my food, I order 1 small sub and I was the only person there... plus there were 3 workers! wtf?!  ...  ... I was like sooo super excited because I heard great things about this place! So I get to work and unwrap this mystical creature and bam! Its like my hard on went away! I asked politely for no tomatoes or onions... what do you think I see?! So I was like ugh. I sat there and poked out all the yuckiness and took a bite and almost choked because of the insane amount of pepper!  ...  ... I will not return, Ive had wayyy yummier sandwiches from 7-11.

REVIEW #31:  2 stars  (170 chars)
The sandwich was great!!!! But my concern was about the fact that is no restroom over there so I couldn't wash my hands,  and instead of eating over there I went home, );

REVIEW #32:  2 stars  (512 chars)
This review is for the location not the food. It seems kind of rough to me...including: the ex worker who came in and stated that if she was still working there no one would be smoking... they would be back here doing the dishes and cleaning the floor to the overall cleanliness or lack there of everything else. The window, walls, door, etc...need to be cleaned. I would think with the corporate headquarters in Las Vegas you would not find a store/location in this condition...it didn't get this way overnight.

REVIEW #33:  1 stars  (832 chars)
Came here yesterday while I got off from work, their was a few people ahead of me, both parties had their orders done wrong and while I was waiting in line after 15 mins and the line grew bigger I said I want to place an order, she told me I have to go in the front of the store to place the order. I waited 15 mins for the lady to fix peoples orders, and the line grew bigger and she had the nerve to tell me that? I walked right out. I was more embarrassed then anything as well. I heard people even wispering on how i stood their for that long to be told to go in the back of the line. So rude, she could have kindly still took my order and take it too the front line cooks as she did with 2 parties in front of me.  I will never go their again. All other Capriotti's will still take the order where ever you go inside the store.

REVIEW #34:  1 stars  (1494 chars)
I have to say first that I love Capriotti's. The sandwiches are delicious and the options are terrific. ...  ... However, this location's service has been poor to put it nicely. I let it slide the first time as a fluke, but the second time was nearly the same experience. The first time I called in an order shortly after 11 to beat the main lunch rush. When I arrived, they weren't exceptionally busy, but there were a few people there. I let them know I was there to pick up my order and I paid and started waiting. My bag was ready with 3 sandwiches and I was just waiting on one more. I literally waited 20 minutes for that last sandwich. I was asked several times what I was waiting for and I let them know, but that did not help. ...  ... The second time I decided to avoid the call-in debacle, so I ordered three sandwiches and brought two friends along to order 2 more each (we were picking up for our office). We were one of three orders they had to make at the time, so again, they were not slammed by any means. After a few minutes, my friends received their orders, but mine was waiting on ONE sandwich. I was asked again what I was waiting on and then informed them. Several minutes later and after 5 other groups got their orders, my sandwich was ready. I proceeded to the register and was ready to pay when they handed a call-in order to the person behind me and asked me to step aside so that they could pay. ...  ... What a slap in the face, I'll never return to this location.

REVIEW #35:  1 stars  (267 chars)
I was just about to place my order,  when I looked over the counter and saw how filthy it was.  The grill was black and food debris all over the counters. I immediately left and went to the Cappriotti's on Sunset and Annie Oakley. They are extremely clean. Thank God!

REVIEW #36:  1 stars  (697 chars)
I was visiting Vegas and we originally ordered from Capriottis on Warm Springs and Eastern but they constantly run out of roast beef and don't tell you until you are ready to pickup your order.  Again disappointed by this specific Capriottis we cancelled our order and went to JJs.   ...  ... The sandwich establishments are in different classes but JJs is reliable.   ...  ... I would have rated this review a 5 star instead of a 1 star if they would just tell me that they ran out of the specific ingredients before I drive down to be told they ran out of roast beef again.    ...  ... I'm a fan of their other locations to include the one in Dallas as they never seem to have a supply shortage.

REVIEW #37:  1 stars  (360 chars)
Poor quality food, always dry and unpleasant... A lot of employees enjoy talking trash about their employer in front of customers. Sandwiches made incorrectly often. Would not recommend. ...  ... The owner has resorted to writing poor reviews for her competitors businesses, now reducing their business rating down to 1 star, in my opinion. Extremely childish.

REVIEW #38:  1 stars  (564 chars)
The thing that frustrates me the most about yelp reviews is you don't know the level of taste from the people who are reviewing. This place was gross. The pastrami, which was one of their signature sandwiches was terrible. Soggy bread. Too much sauce, of course to cover up the quality of the meat. If you're a true foodie don't waste your time. ...  ... I did want to mention, to those foodies in search of something special, there is an Asian market in the same mall that has an off the hook hot food bar with homemade egg rolls and incredible Asian delectables.

REVIEW #39:  1 stars  (489 chars)
Their food is always very good, that is not the issue. This locations is a shit hole. It is so filthy and gross, if it were not for the fact that I was starving and the guy wore gloves so that I could watch him cook my meal, I would have left. Many of the Capriotti's need to get their acts together wtih cleanliness, namingly: Capriotti's near Anthem, E. Sunset Rd.and Stephanie St. Cesspools, everyone of them and I think that they are all the same owner. Shame on you all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Capriotti's has the best turkey sub in all of America. They roast their turkeys everyday and the white rolls are of top quality. Go ahead and order the two footer you won't be disappointed. That's a whole days worth of food right there.

Got a Bobbie and Homemade Turkey, last customer for the night; they were delicious!  Consistency is key!

REVIEW #3:  5 stars  (471 chars)
I like this location. It is close to home, always clean, and the staff are friendly. That is my trifecta right there! ...  ... The sandwiches are huge and super tasty. The Bobbie is amazing and everyone needs to eat it at least once in their lifetime. If you don't, it's like a life half lived. The cheesesteak is really good too. My husband's favorite is the Capastrami.  ...  ... Do yourself a favor and swing by for an awesome sandwich that will make your tummy happy.

Ok, so I am NOT a fan of Delis AT ALL none.. I hate strange meat,meat thats been laying out under someone breathing all over it.. chopped meat that someone else has touched..blah, blah blah..Im a freak, I know. However, I was lured into this shop with a friend who swears that this place is the END ALL. I of course will have a bite of his because I am a snob who doesn't eat stuff like that. lol! He had to restrain me from demolishing his Capastrami Sandwich. That had to be THE BEST sandwich that ever crossed my lips. Tender meat, perfect coleslaw, perfect melted cheese and the bread? Fugetaboutit! Seriously.That sandwich made my heart happy! :o)  My only complaint is it wasn't hand fed to me by a rippling man in a loin cloth with my drink...lol!

The Bobbie, aka The World's Most Delicious Sandwich Ever. That is all.

REVIEW #7:  5 stars  (262 chars)
The bobby is the best sandwich ever made! I love it. $20 for a 20 inch sandwich is a great deal, half for now half for later. Can never go wrong with a great pulled turkey sandwich with cranberry sauce, stuffing, and added lettuce. If you never been you must go!

REVIEW #8:  5 stars  (1117 chars)
They say a sandwich can make or break a day. OK, maybe not. I say that, but by the amount of sandwiches I eat at Capriotti's, I may qualify for a "they". ...  ... When I moved to Vegas back in November, I saw a bunch of these Capriotti's locations around town. I also happened to see a Thrillist article about a new location in Beverly Hills (I moved here from LA). ...  ... I paid a visit to this location, and I've been back MANY times. I follow the company on Twitter (@capriottis) and even won a free sub for being a follower. Very interactive company and they WANT your business. ...  ... But I digress... ...  ... Their signature is obviously The Bobbie. Pulled Turkey, Cranberry Sauce, Stuffing and Mayo. Divine. Heavenly. Any other words that describe it? Angelic and pristine? It'll turn your tongue into Niagara Falls.  ...  ... Also the Grilled Italian, which I wont bother describing, because it's an experience all to itself. As is the Capostramie. ...  ... Aside from the great sandwiches, you have your choice of Wise chips, and TASTYKAKES! Prepare for an experience.  ...  ... It's worth the calories.

REVIEW #9:  5 stars  (1025 chars)
Top notch location! Anybody who has lived here long enough and loves Capriotti's knows that this is a old school location. Who knew it would grow to be so big and have locations all over? I did! Well, I dreamed haha. It is nice to have a Caps nearby no matter what area of town I am working so I can grab lunch. ...  ... Always clean inside and the staff are very friendly. I usually call my order in for convenience.This location can be so busy.  The "Capastrami" is my fav. If you love pastrami, coleslaw, and thousand island dressing then this is the sandwich for you. ... I love to stop by before heading to the nearby Doc Romeo park. The paper they wrap the sandwiches in carries well. My man tries the "Cheese Steak" and I sampled a bite. It isn't a true cheese steak and would go elsewhere for that type of sandwich. Good thing there is a variety of options. They have vegetarian options too! ...  ... The parking lot is sometimes cramped but who cares when you know you're going to eat one of these delicious gems?!?!

Bobby! Cole Turkey!!! Slawbie Joe!!!!!!  ...  ... Oh shit, you guys have no clue what I'm talking about if you've never been to Capriotti's. Their standard subs including homemade turkey and homemade roast beef are fantastic by themselves but their specialty sandwiches are what really elevates this place to epic status. ...  ... The Bobby is the standard Turkey Dinner sub including turkey, cranberry sauce, stuffing. Everything seems homemade and delicious and the price for what you're eating is really hard to beat. The Cole Turkey and Slawbie(sp?) Joe both have a base of Russian dressian and a really yummy coleslaw, the only difference being that one is Turkey and one is Roast Beef. I wonder which is which? Hmmmm ...  ... Anything you order here will make your stomach happy so go nuts! Sadly, this location is run by young kids who basically get your order wrong one out of every 3 times so beware. Capriotti's as a whole gets 5 stars but I'll knock off half a star for the haphazard service.

REVIEW #13:  4 stars  (786 chars)
First time here and ordered the Bobbie, Thanksgiving dinner on a bun (turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce, mayo).  Bread was fresh and everything was seasoned nicely.  We got the medium size (12") and wow, it must have weighed about 2 pounds!  Plenty of food for myself and my hubby.  We were the only ones in the shop at the time, so our order was processed pretty quickly.  I don't know how busy this place gets, but I believe one should phone in one's order to save time.  Something I noticed: the floors were a little bit dirty, not so much to dissuade me from trying a sandwich, but just enough to wonder why it wasn't cleaner, especially when there was time and opportunity to attend to it?  I'll come here again to try a different sandwich....and to see if the floor's cleaner.  :)

REVIEW #14:  4 stars  (304 chars)
I gotta say the Bobbie has to be one of my favorite sandwiches ever.  I absolutely love all the componets that make the sandwich.  Especially the cranberry I appreciate the fact it's not the jello like stuff you get in a can.  For me it's what makes the sandwich.  The capstrami is another good sandwich.

REVIEW #15:  4 stars  (498 chars)
I have to visit this place every time I'm in town!!! ...  ... I order a medium turkey sandwich with cheese, mayo, onions and seasonings. That's it!  ...  ... The turkey is roasted fresh daily. They shred it there. The bread is always fresh and tasty.  ...  ... Sometimes you'll have to wait a while for your sandwich, but let me tell you, it is worth waiting for! ...  ... By far, one of the best sandwiches in town. I wish we had them in Southern California. They put Subway and Quizno's to shame.

REVIEW #16:  4 stars  (309 chars)
If you feel like eating a sandwich you definitely have to come to capriotti's.. they offer several different options but their most popular are their capastrami and their Bobby (must to try it) the mix of the ingredients does not sound that good, but believe me once you put it on your mouth you will love it.

REVIEW #17:  4 stars  (579 chars)
If you've never had a Capriotti's, you've got at least one great & low-cost event left in this town of overdone 99-cent prime rubbery ribs!   Their sandwiches inhabit the opposite spectrum of that boring and lame eatery scale -- they're big, they're seriously delicious, and there's a variety so you can always try to get a new one!  Try is implied because after having your first Bobbie or Capastrami, you may not want to edge out into the equally good Italian or heart-obliterating Cheesesteak.   But you should -- if only to prove to yourself you are good at making decisions!

REVIEW #18:  3 stars  (714 chars)
Cappriotti's would get five stars from me because they are super delicious however the problems with Carpiottis is that they are so friggin' slow I''m pretty sure they are like dry aging their ham for each individual order or something.  Trust though, I am not one of those reviewers who had one bad experience and suddenly wants to use yelp as my soap box to put a business on blast.  Every...time...I...order...it...takes.....f....o..r..e..v...e...r. I'm down to wait like 10 15 minutes (ala In N Out Burger) but it seems like Cappriottis takes like 1/2 an hour for a sandwich like ever time.  I would say if you really really love their food definitely call ahead, if not you will be sitting around for forever.

REVIEW #19:  3 stars  (583 chars)
Gave this place another shot. 1st time at this location. Walked in and was greeted right away. Got the grilled Italian. Was better this time. Good amount of meat. Liked it grilled. Would be better if bun was toasted too, because it got very soggy. Went there about 3 o'clock and was the only customer. There were at least a half-dozen employees there which seemed a little overstaffed for the time. Overall I'm still not impressed with Capriotti's. Idk what people are thinking when they rate this place the best for subs. More and more I'm convinced people from Las Vegas are crazy.

REVIEW #20:  3 stars  (508 chars)
I love Capriotti's in general, and you can find what I have to say about them here: http://www.yelp.com/biz/capriottis-sandwich-shop-las-vegas#hrid:L4A9oqiJjf3XwTohxPdN4A/src:self ...  ... For this location in particular... I wasn't too fond of it.  We happened to be in the area and stopped for a quick dinner.  The employees weren't the friendliest, there are three tables to sit at, and the store seemed like it could use a good scrub (floors especially).  Bonus points for fountain drinks and free water.

REVIEW #21:  3 stars  (620 chars)
I think the staff is nicer at the other Capriotti's I've reviewed. Also this one has a long and open layout where you can smell the food going a lot more....today it was kinda smoky. Oddly, this one doesn't have a public restroom either so bring wipes if you get messy with your sammies.  ...  ... There's not much to say that most people already don't know. ...  ...  I like Thanksgiving dinner a lot and do have cravings for the Bobby and know it's pretty consistent.  ...  ... I'll probably be back to this location since it's the closest to mom and grandma in laws house, but I prefer the location by home much more.

REVIEW #22:  3 stars  (385 chars)
I was a bit skeptical of this little sandwich shop but a local friend of mine raved about it. As far as a sandwich shop goes I'd say it's good. The one thing I really enjoyed was the cole slaw on a number of the special sandwiches. It added a lot of moistness and crunch to an otherwise standard sandwich.  ...  ... Pretty good for a quick bite. I recommend the Capistrami. Very tasty!

REVIEW #24:  3 stars  (989 chars)
Stopped by for Lunch the other day.  This particular location has a handful of tables and chairs inside.  When I went, there were only a few people in the joint. ...  ... I ordered a Small (9") Italian Sub (Genoa Salami, Capacola, Prosciutini) w/Hot Peppers, Provolone, Mustard, Mayo, Pickles, Lettuce, Tomatoes, Onions.  Also had a bag of Jalapeno Chips and Bottled Water to go with the Sandwich. ...  ... The food came out a few minutes later and I dove right in.  As usual, it was a sloppy meal with stuff falling out of the Sandwich.  The ingredients were fresh and tasty.  For some reason, even though it's a Small Sandwich, it's always very filling. ...  ... Over the years Capriotti's has declined somewhat.  It use to blow me away, now that it's been franchised I think their ingredients have lost some quality....can't support that with fact, only my opinion after eating at various Capriotti's for over 17 yrs. ...  ... Will I return?  Probably, but won't crave it like I use to.

Good sandwiches but horrible service.  Staff of young boys are rude and unprofessional.

REVIEW #27:  2 stars  (461 chars)
I luv capriottis at other locations but the staff at this one is WEAK! They are slow and unorganized. The head girl who seems to be in charge most times I go doesnt keep things flowing well like the other locations around town. Take some pride in the art of sandwich making and customer service! Your customers are paying around $10 for a combo meal...You chose to work there, don't be miserable, gloomy, and lazy. I hope they step it up cuz I love the location

REVIEW #28:  2 stars  (691 chars)
Let me start by writing that I LOVE Capriotti's, but not lately. I always get a turkey sub with absolutely everything on it, messy and dripping with all of the toppings. The sandwich is usually busting with turkey, not deli turkey, but real turkey. However, the last few times I've gotten it the amount of turkey was minimal - barely there. Very disappointing given that I appreciated the good value the sandwiches have always been. Unfortunately, with the new owners I think they have instituted a new policy about the amount of meat you get. So, it's no longer delectable or a good value. How sad. I may have to drive to another location to see if it's a corporate-wide policy. I hope not.

REVIEW #29:  2 stars  (910 chars)
OK so I love a bobbie, i'll repeat I love a bobbie and I am a sucker for turkey day leftovers.  That being said I would give this place 1 star if it wasn't for that one sandwich.  Their bread is dry, the prices are kind of expensive and the service in any of the caps I have ever been to isn't anything spectacular (I have been to this one the most).  I guess the cap pastrami is OK too but their cold subs are tasteless, just horrible, and this is usually my favorite type of sandwich especially on a hot summer day. I recently got a small turkey sandwich with all the fixings and I ate half of it and I just gave up on it, it might have been the worst turkey sandwich I have ever had in my like and I am not fooling. The bread is the most important part of a sandwich and that is the number one thing caps is lacking, also their toppings on cold subs are plain so the whole thing comes over as boring filler.

REVIEW #30:  1 stars  (686 chars)
Crappy customer service! They were out of stuffing but didn't say anything. After 10 mins waiting I asked what we were waiting for and they said the stuffing would be just 5 more mins. Waited a total of 25 mins and they had forgotten my order. Other people got their bobbies that they ordered after me before I did. I asked for the manager and he had been standing there the whole time and didn't even offer an apology until I said something to him. I don't care how far I have to go out of my way I won't be going back to this location. This is a privately owned franchise location and I hope the manager cares enough to train his employees better and not lose money out of his pocket.

REVIEW #31:  1 stars  (596 chars)
I have been to this shop twice.  ... The first order was a philly cheese steak, no onions, no peppers. Got peppers and onions. Strike one. ... Yesterday Ordered two sandwiches, a 20" ham and turkey, got a 9' ham and roast beef. Strike two. ... second sandwich was an italian no peppers. Got peppers. Strike three. ... Should be able to expect a simple sandwich order to be correct. It's a sandwich shop, not a restaurant with 75 choices of entrees and salads, etc. ... Go to Port of Subs just over the bridge at cheyenne and rainbow. Faster service and the sandwich is correct. Damn construction.

REVIEW #32:  1 stars  (532 chars)
I really don't care much for this sandwich shop I think Jimmy Johns's is better, anyhow my fiance loves the bobbie and I get suckered into it every so often. The wait is so long that you could almost buy a turkey cook it yourself and make a sandwich no kidding. We ordered a large bobbie and it took 25 minutes to get. Their excuse was they ran out of stuffing! NO communication and when my fiance complained to the manager they didn't care. I despise all the Capriotti's if they went bankrupt no loss. Jimmy Johns's is way better!!

REVIEW #33:  1 stars  (440 chars)
The one by South Point was that I first I found & assume each is just as good since its cookie cutter.  LOVED the food. ...  ... Didn't get to order here because they wouldn't let me use the restroom first.   ...  ... People are eating everywhere inside on tables and chairs and outside on the table and chairs so its obviously not a take out only establishment.   ...  ... POOR POLICY.  Its not like its a store where I can steal in there?

This place is amazing. The staff is amazing and the food. We have been to another Capriottis around town and had some rude service once but this one is great.  ... We usually get the Bobbi. It's turkey, with stuffing, mayo and cranberry sauce. Pretty much just perfect.  ... So if you haven't tried it please do!

Writing a review because one of the vegetarian reviewers gave them a one star. ...  ... this place is good. if you are a vegetarian or vegan or whatever, please dont go here and spare us meat eaters the grief. ...  ... Capriottis is the bomb.

REVIEW #3:  4 stars  (384 chars)
Always a great sandwich here. from the Capristrami to the Bobbie you can never go wrong with a sub from Cariottis. Soft bread and full of fillings there consistency among their chain is very admirable as far as chair restaurants go. I'm lucky to have one right across the street from where I live. Youll pay a bit more than a sandwich from Subways but it's worth it extra buck or two.

REVIEW #4:  3 stars  (312 chars)
This is gonna be short and sweet. Good food but I hate when you advertise something you don't have. I can understand if something is online not on your site but you actually don't offer it. You can't fix everything. But on your own windows? If you don't offer delivery please don't have it all over your windows.

REVIEW #5:  1 stars  (292 chars)
The intelligent folks at this establishment put turkey meat on a vegetarian Bobbie sandwich because they don't understand the meaning of the word "vegetarian". They'll also refuse to make you a new sandwich and won't refund the sandwich that they made improperly. Now THAT'S customer service.

REVIEW #6:  1 stars  (273 chars)
Took about 20 minutes to make my sandwich with only 3 people ahead of me. Also there's no reason for them to wear gloves as they'll type in the register and take your order holding a pen with gloves on then turn around n make a sandwich. Not going to this location anymore.

Every Vegas local's favorite sandwich shop. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu, but the most popular sandwich is The Bobbie. It's Thanksgiving on a sub roll, and they do it perfectly at Capriotti's.

I love the Philly here, Amazing!!! Staff and management at this location are very friendly!! My stomach is now complete. I live close so it's convenient. But I'd drive past other Sandwich Shops, just to grub here :)

REVIEW #4:  5 stars  (871 chars)
I recently discovered this Capriotti's not far from where I live. What a find!! The sandwiches are amazing. As a sandwich-lover, I cannot get enough of this place and have since tried most of the options on the menu. I think the best is the roast beef - pulled instead of sliced like at most sandwich places. ...  ... The sandwiches are made-to-order, so it can take a little longer than other sub shops, like Subway, but it is well worth it. You still get a pretty full array of options on the sandwich, it just isn't in an assembly line. They don't have many sides (only an atypical selection of potato chips), so you go here just for the sandwiches. Also, it's more of a take-away place. They do have a small bar and one table where you could dine-in if you really wanted to, but there's no atmosphere. It's basically just a deli counter. ...  ... Highly recommended!!

REVIEW #5:  5 stars  (200 chars)
I stalk these guys when I'm in a city that has em.  I don't live in a Capriotti's city anymore, but I live in a Capriotti's world.  I can live off of the cheesesteak with peps, bobbie, and capistrami.

REVIEW #6:  5 stars  (839 chars)
I'm a sucker for a good sandwich. And this place fits my needs. ...  ... Online ordering to make it quick and fast, just my type of place. Easy to find, and the employees are extremely friendly.  ...  ... Love how family oriented this store is. I always see them doing something for the community. Taking donations, food ones or money and helping out local charity's. I love to support company's that help out those in need, it's always good to give back. Karma is grand.  ...  ... My favorite so far is the Italian. The seasonings and blend of oil, vinegar and sauces just melt together to crest a rich base for the sandwiches. The fresh baked in store bread is crunchy and soft inside. They really don't lack on filling the sandwich up either.. Tons of meat. About twice, almost three times as much as subway gives. Yum! Tastes so fresh.

REVIEW #7:  5 stars  (1012 chars)
If you're from Las Vegas, you are probably very familiar with Capriotti's.  My friends who were in town from Cali, however, were not.  We were looking for an easy sandwich place to satisfy our lunch time craves and I just knew I had to expose them to the deliciousness that is Capriotti's. ... The two most popular sandwiches are by far the Bobbie and the Capistrami.  The Bobbie can be summed up as Thanksgiving on a roll, with fresh turkey meat, mayo, stuffing, and cranberry sauce.  The Capistrami has pastrami meat, thousand island dressing, swiss cheese and cole slaw.  Both are great options and I go back and forth between the two.  I've also heard the Philly Cheese Steak is pretty darn good too, but I have yet to try it. ... The sandwiches always take a little longer to make at Capriotti's (especially if you are comparing to something like Subway), but we don't usually mind.  After all, it takes longer to make when its fresh. You can also call ahead and order, and I believe this location delivers!

REVIEW #12:  5 stars  (653 chars)
Stopped by this afternoon to get something to tie me over until my late dinner reservation tonight.  My first thought was "Why don't they have a 6" sandwich, I'm only going to eat a little and waste the rest.". Ahhh, no.  I decided on the 9" Capastrami.  Needless to say I ate the entire sub in like 4 stop lights.....it was that good.  Perfect blend of salty, sweet, hot, and cold.  The bread had a wonderful soft chewy texture and the sandwich was incredibly juicy and flavorful.  Not to mention the guy at the counter was very nice and friendly.  Oh and to answer his question........yes, I think you guys should open a store in Hawaii, we'd love it!

Vegetarians rejoice! They have a vegetarian sliced turkey sandwich, and amazingly enough it taste good! The rolls are delicious, the meats, cheeses, and toppings are always fresh, Capriotti's is one of my favorite sandwich shops. ...  ... Note to vegetarians: they also have a veggie cole turkey sandwich, a veggie philly cheese steak sandwich, and a veggie cheeseburger sandwich. YES! Choices in food, finally!!

REVIEW #14:  4 stars  (267 chars)
Amazingly delicious veggie cheesesteak sandwich.  Shared a $12.75 20" sandwich and we were both full.  Comes with cheese, peppers, and onions, if you want mushrooms, there is an extra charge. ...  ... I deducted one star because they need a better restroom situation.

REVIEW #15:  4 stars  (1548 chars)
If you are looking for a delicious sandwich shop that's a step above the ordinary Subway and Quizmo's, then Capriotti's is the place to go. The first time I walked into this place, the staff behind the counter was super friendly. I told them I was a Capriotti's virgin and asked for some recommendations. The nice girl behind the counter suggested the "Capastrami" which is "Hot Pastrami, Melted Swiss Cheese, Russian Dressing, and Cole Slaw on a soft roll." How can one go wrong with that? "Sure thing" I fired back and we were off to a journey towards flavorful bliss. ...  ... I watch in anticipation as the sandwich maker spins his magic. About 7 minutes later, my name is called out and this masterpiece wrapped in white butcher paper is bestowed upon me. To make a long story short... I ate it. It was damn good. The pastrami was tender and the cole slaw and russian dressing ratio was perfect. The bread was soft and the whole sandwich warm and inviting. I didnt think I was going to eat the whole thing.... But damn it was good. I didnt want to take the risk of bringing half of it home and not letting the sandwich fulfill its destiny. ...  ... On my 2nd trip back I ordered the Bobbie and it was a little dry. Somehow I thought the turkey would be warm. It's served cold. It was still good nevertheless. ...  ... On my 3rd trip back I ordered the meatball sandwich. It was yummy... But somehow my heart still belongs to the Capastrami. ...  ... I included some pictures. Dang. How do you people write food reviews without getting hungry?!

REVIEW #16:  4 stars  (444 chars)
My experience with this store has been pleasant and filling. I wish they were cheaper but I dont mind paying more for a more flavorful experience. They could use a little bit of remodeling though.   ...  ... I ordered the bobby and the girl made it really fast Within 5 mins i was in and out Cant beat that!! A delicious Quality sandwich made fresh for me :D. ...  ... Thank you for your hard work and for making me feel like a valued customer.

"I did it all for the Bobbie"  ...  ... Yes folk's "Bobbie" sub is their nationally acclaimed best seller.  ... Real turkey (not the processed junk) cranberry sauce, stuffing, and mayo seal the deal.  ...  ... Thanksgiving dinner on a roll, come on seriously...does it get any better?  ...  ... I am just a fan of turkey period, turkey and bacon, turkey and cheese, turkey and avocado, you name it I like it. The "Bobbie" sub is my ultimate favorite way of eating my turkey in form of a sub by far.  ...  ... I know most of us las vegas locals are aware of this sub, if you are a visitor or new to Capriotti's then give this sub a shot!  ...  ... *Honorable mention is the "Capistrami" sub, hot pastrami, swiss cheese, russian dressing and coleslaw. Mmmm yummy as well.

REVIEW #19:  3 stars  (167 chars)
Ordered their cheesesteak it wasn't as cheesy as I wanted and too hot they put too many peppers. I think it's over priced you usually get fries with the amount I paid.

REVIEW #20:  3 stars  (883 chars)
Popped in here about noon on a Friday afternoon. First off, the counter is a little disorganized. I couldn't tell where the line began and where it ended. The staff also seemed new, and not at all prepared for the lunch rush. While my name is clearly "Ben", the cashier seemed to have heard "Matt" but at least she got my sandwich right.  ... I ordered my standard: a medium "bobbie" with cheese. I've got to say that I've had this sandwich probably 4 times now at other Capriotti's, and this was the driest that it has ever come. A sandwich that features stuffing, bread and dry turkey better have some mayo on it. Otherwise, your mouth will be left drier than Britney Spears' concert calendar.  ... The sandwich is still quite filling and the three stars was really for this particular rendition of it. The other sandwiches from the Sahara off-the-Strip Cap's have been phenomenal.

This place right down the street from a relative's place so we visited this place yesterday.   ...  ... The food came quickly and the staff was friendly.  I got away with a large "Bobbie" -- THANKSGIVING in a roll.  I haven't had this in a while and it is just as good as I remember it.  The bobby has turkey, stuffing and cranberry! ...  ... I've frequented this particular location in the past, probably about 8 years ago.  Parking is a little tight at this location in my opinion. ...  ... I would still prefer to drive the little extra distance to the location by my work by the area of Tropicana and Fort Apache or by my home by the area of Town Center & Summerlin Parkway.

REVIEW #23:  2 stars  (731 chars)
I personally like the food at Capriottis, I prefer the one on Silverado Ranch for a few reasons. ...  ... 1. It is much cleaner ... 2. The staff is much friendlier  ... 3. The food is prepared better  ... 4. They have yet to mess up an order ...  ... The location on Sahara is not very clean and everytime we have called in an order the girl that "ALWAYS" seems to answer the phone is completely rude and for some reason does not understand what no peppers means. The sandwiches are always a few notches below the other locations and the attitude of the employee may actually play into that response.  ... I hope they can turn around the customer service and clean up the act a little because overall capriottis has a good product.

REVIEW #24:  2 stars  (364 chars)
I was so excited when I ordered my eggplant parm sandwich....but it was just disappointing :( There was hardly any sauce on it, the eggplant was overcooked...parts were crunchy and parts were tough and chewy like a tire. The bread was soggy and tasteless....I love subs, and I don't think I'll go back to one of these again..there are too many better places to go.

REVIEW #25:  2 stars  (1188 chars)
I'm not a cheesesteak aficionado but I do feel like I know a good cheesesteak when I see one, or rather when I taste one. I ordered two subs. A medium Cheese Steak and a medium Italian. My first gripe happened before I even left the shop with my sandwiches. The man ringing me up for my order gave me my total and when I handed him my credit card he grabbed it with his gloves still on. Gloves that had a meat substance-like film on them. Then he proceeds to hand me a receipt and a pen with the same slimy gloves.  ...  ... I get home and try the cheese steak first. Not impressed at all. First of all half of the meat had burnt edges. Secondly there was almost no cheese in the entire sub. And when I say almost no cheese I literally mean, there was hardly any cheese at all. It took me two big bites before I tasted a hint of cheese. The roll was pretty good though. ...  ... The Italian was a decent sub. No gripes at all. Not amazing but not bad.  ...  ... All in all, given the fact that the cheese steak was a big disappointment, the guy ringing up my order handled my credit card with slimy gloves and the total for two subs came to be almost $19.00 I give this place a 2/5 stars.

REVIEW #26:  2 stars  (631 chars)
Very disappointing recent experience at around 1:30 pm on a Wednesday afternoon.  Store was absolutely slammed with customers, yet there were only 3 people behind the counter!?  Plus the phone was ringing every five seconds so no one could get anything done! Maybe someone or two called in sick that day, but boy did the customers pay for it. I waited at least 20 minutes for my turkey sandwich on wheat..which is about the easiest thing to make on the menu!  ...  ... On the plus side, the employees are nice, and the rolls are better here than most other capriottis.  I sure hope they get their stuff together or I won't be back.

REVIEW #27:  1 stars  (721 chars)
I have been increasingly disappointed in Capriotti's. I have never been able to eat a 9" turkey sandwich with everything on it in a single sitting. Until now. It was mostly bread. There were traces of turkey on it with hints of toppings. When I started eating at Capriotti's over 15 years ago, the sandwiches would be overflowing, because there would be so much turkey on them, the roll could hardly contain it and the plentiful toppings. My sandwich would usually feel as heavy as a brick. Today it was a feather. I might as well have gone to Subway. Sadly, this is not an isolated event or location - it has been the downward trend now at this location, as well as the one on Cheyenne. Save your money and go elsewhere.

REVIEW #28:  1 stars  (1206 chars)
i've been to other capriotti's around the town and i love this place. however this location is horrible! i usually go to the one on cheyenne and they do a fantastic job. ...  ... i called ahead for a pick up order a mushroom cheese steak sandwich. at the other locations they usually ask follow up questions about what i want on my sandwich. this place did no such thing. i had to ask about each individual item that was on the sandwich since the guy seemed so clueless.  i called at 134pm and my food wasn't ready until 154pm. the guy that took my order didn't give me a time estimate or a price estimate.  ...  ... as far as food quality. i ordered a MUSHROOM CHEESEsteak sandwich. there was barely any mushroom and almost no cheese in it. My family and i were all confused because we're used to the other location that produces higher quality sandwiches. My sister thought that they left the mushroom out but I did see 3 pieces in my piece.  ...  ... why are they skimping on the cheese on a cheesesteak sandwich? FAIL ...  ... why are they skimping on the mushroom they charged me $1.00 extra for?  ...  ... never coming back here again. i'll stick to the other locations that have delicious sandwiches

A must stop when I am in Las Vegas!  ...  ... The sandwiches are under $6 for a small, but a small is huge! Lasts me for lunch and dinner, so I consider that a bargain.  ...  ... Even though the Capastrami seems to get the most love here- and I have tried it a loved it- I prefer the Slaw Be Joe sandwich by far. Capriotti's roast beef gets missed in reviews and it is a painful under sight. It rules! It is not like roast beef cold cuts, but like actual shredded roast! SO GOOD! I get the sandwich with cole slaw and russian dressing, sub swiss for provolone and omit the mayo- the sandwich has enough with the cole slaw IMO.  ...  ... Their cheesesteaks are also bomb. I wish I liked turkey because the Bobby sandwich looks wonderful.  ...  ... I also like that they have Wise brand chips and Tastykakes- both from Philly (home of the best sandwiches in the world!)  ...  ... My last request and plea- PLEASE bring Capriotti's to Orange County, CA!

Across the street from South Point Hotel & Casino, this sandwich shop is as good as it gets!  I happened to be staying in South Las Vegas and had the pleasure of treating my British friends to these incredibly delicious and superfresh homemade sandwiches.   The Slaw-Be-Jo was TDF!!  They are huge and well-priced.  No matter where you are in Vegas, this sandwich shop is worth the drive.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!

After living in vegas for two years from Boston I can finally say I found a sandwich shop that can deliver an east coast classic steak and cheese sub! Great steak and warm soft sub roll combine to bring utopia to your taste buds. Two thumbs up from me.

REVIEW #5:  5 stars  (463 chars)
Are you kidding me? Seriously, this is the best sandwich shop ever. Whenever I'm in Vegas this is must. Not only are the portions GYNORMOUS, but the price is cheap. I usually walk off the strip to this location and it is shady, so I would not recommend doing that at night. It is so good, that whenever I am in Vegas, I try to get a room with a fridge so that I can stock up. Please bring this shop to Chicago. If I were to ever own a franchise, this would be it.

Capastrami is the Best!!!! The Bobbie is good to but I have to say the Capastrami stole my heart. Whether it be on the to or leaving Vegas I always have to stop by and grab a sandwich.

REVIEW #15:  5 stars  (774 chars)
Earned every star with their awesome sandwich. Totally surprised my wife and I on the quality. ...  ... On the way back from Vegas we just wanted something light and fast. My friend (thanks Ken) recommended this place, so we thought it'd be good to just have a sandwich for a change. We didn't know it was just a take-out place so we ended up taking it to go and plan to eat it in the car. While I was filling up the gas, my wife started to open the sandwich wrapper. I knew it was really really good because she didn't make any noise. SHe was too busy enjoying the Capastrami to think about sharing. So i had a bite and it was truly the best Pastrami. I got the Cheese Steak and it was amazing too. ...  ... We both agreed that this is a must come next time we're in Vegas.

First of all, the great service at this location cannot be replaced. I lived down the street from this Capriotti's but I moved further away this last month and yet I still go to this location! The guys are hilarious and accommodating. It's just always a pleasant experience at this particular location. ...  ... Secondly, the food is just as great if not better than the service. If you love sandwiches, you'll love Capriotti's. I've taken so many of my friends for their first Capriotti's experience here, and literally not one of them have ever been disappointed. ...  ... If you're vegetarian, try the veggie turkey. It's amazing!!! I cannot stop raving about that sandwich. I ate it everyday for two months haha. If you're not vegetarian, try the Bobbie! It's basically a Thanksgiving dinner on a sandwich. ...  ... Long story, short, come to this Capriotti's! You won't be disappointed.

Great to see that everyone here loves Capriotti's as well!  I've been coming here for nearly 3 years now and I'm satisfied every single time.  I usually grab their signature subs.  The bobbie and the capastrami are my two favorites.  Great staff and great prices.  Even if you're not a sub-type guy or gal, they have plenty of sandwiches to choose from -- freshly made every time.  If you live in vegas and havent tried capriotti's.. SHAME ON YOU!

Great, friendly, and fast service during the lunch rush.  Bobbie sandwich was everything I wanted it to be.  Beats eating lunch in the smokey casino across the street easily.

Holy Moses!!!! Best chicken cheesesteak I've ever had!!! I highly recommend this place.

REVIEW #23:  5 stars  (175 chars)
Honesty, I don't know anything about the food here, but your sign twirler is awesome! I was entertained while waiting at the stop light. I will definitely try a sandwich soon!

REVIEW #24:  5 stars  (1087 chars)
How the HECK? I honestly thought that I wrote about this place months back (July 8th). Anyway, CAPRIOTTI'S is the BEST sandwich shop in the universe. I'm being dramatic and yes...I'm exaggerating, but that is TRUE! I love their SUB SANDWICHES! Especially the Bobbi! OH, BOBBI! ::drools like Homer Simpson::  ...  ... I also ordered the other subs, but the BOBBI is the one that stands out above the rest. I love the sauce, I love the cabbage, I love the meat, I love it ALL! I was so sad when I had to leave VEGAS and travel back home to LA, but guess what.....a week after my BREAK-UP from the LV Capriotti's, I found one "GRAND OPENING" of a Capriotti's in MY AREA! Commence song!: "REunnnnnnnnited and it feeelsssss so GOOD!" ...  ... Immediately, I drove in and bought BOBBI back into my life. I was so happy that I HAD to share this with the FAMILY. I bought it for friends, and they FELL IN LOVE with it, and now....my Family-Family will experience the same!  ...  ... FYI, the one closest to me is in Azusa-Covina area, next to the Chuck-E-Cheese towards Azusa Pacific University!

I came here at least once a week when I lived down the street. This is the BIZNASS!!!

REVIEW #26:  5 stars  (120 chars)
I get the large steak and cheese with mushrooms and onions! It's huge and yummy and I eat the whole thing! Just had one!

REVIEW #27:  5 stars  (110 chars)
I had the Bobbi and my wife had the Pastrami. Both we absolutely amazing and I would recommend both to anyone.

REVIEW #28:  5 stars  (359 chars)
I just had the Bobbie, billed as the best sandwich in America. The medium version was everything i expected, stuffed full of homemade turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce, and mayo. The service was super fast and the girl working at the counter was super cute. All in all, Capriotti's was awesome and i'll definitely go back later this week before I leave Vegas.

REVIEW #29:  5 stars  (284 chars)
I look forward to eating here every time I come to Las Vegas. I got the 20" cheesesteak, a 12" bobbie for the wife and a grilled cheese for the boy. I receive friendly service and would recommend this place to out-of-towners like me who get tired of eating at their hotel restaurants.

REVIEW #30:  5 stars  (275 chars)
I love this place.  And that comes even after mistakes were made.  I was already loyal but once my order was not done right.  I brought it back and it was replaced but they refunded my money and gave me vouchers.  ... I was clear that it was not a big deal but they insisted.

REVIEW #31:  5 stars  (148 chars)
I love this sandwich shop, and will continue being a return customer! If you are looking for a great sandwich shop, this is the place to check out!!

REVIEW #32:  5 stars  (352 chars)
I was ecstatic to see they opened a shop next to our Vegas home!  The Bobbie is a better version of the leftover Thanksgiving dinner sandwich my grandfather used to make.  It is the perfect balance of moist turkey, savory stuffing and perfect cranberry sauce on the freshest bread.  I always get a medium so I can have half for lunch the following day!

REVIEW #33:  5 stars  (338 chars)
I'm a big fan of delicious but healthy sandwiches and Capriotti's fits the bill. We ordered the famous Bobbie sandwich and, boy, it isn't just huge but the whole sandwich is more than enough for three people! This sub is made of homemade bread, homemade turkey, cranberry sauce, delish stuffing, and Mayo! The sandwich is totally amazing!

REVIEW #34:  5 stars  (549 chars)
If you can't wait for Thanksgiving like me, Capriotti's Bobbie sandwich will more than appease your cravings!  The Bobbie consists of shredded white turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce, mayonaise and I heard it's even better with jalapenos.  Another plus for this place is their cheap pricing.  For $7 you can get a 9-inch sub, which is definitely worth your money because it's huge and packed with meat and stuffing.  Every time I've got a sandwich here, there are usually leftovers for later.  This place is definitely my FAVORITE deli in Las Vegas.

REVIEW #35:  5 stars  (662 chars)
If you come to Vegas you MUST COME HERE. Lemme tell you rite now, this place is SUBWAY ON CRACK. ...  ... You can't go wrong with Italian or Turkey, since they're pretty standard for subs. I don't know why, but they taste so much better than subway. One thing I do know is that unlike subway or quiznos, they give you lots of meat instead of packing it with tons of lettuce! I've tried the Bobbie, and it's like a Thanksgiving meal packed into a sandwich. It's a hate it- or - love it kinda deal. It wasn't bad, but I'll stick with the Italian. ...  ... Also, for $13 you get TWENTY INCHES. Yea, 20 inches. ...  ... I ain't never goin back to subways after this.

REVIEW #36:  5 stars  (1164 chars)
It was one of those tired nights where we supposedly wanted something "small" since we just had a pretty big meal. My brother suggested Capriotti's. I was stoked as I wanted to try that place the last time we visited. ...  ... Browsed the menu and I chose the Slaw BeJo which has roast beef, provolone cheese, russian dressing, and cole slaw. It looked unbelievable in the pictures on their menu. My sister-in-law suggested me end my hubs share a large so I chose that (mind you I had no idea it would almost be the same length of a school bus). My family also ordered the Capastrami and Cole Turkey and a chopped italian salad. ...  ... We went to pick up our order and the bag with the sandwiches in it weighed as much as a toddler. The sandwiches were huge! It could probably feed me for a whole week. I could only eat a quarter of the large and it took a few days to finish since we ordered so much. I must say the sandwich was amazing. I wish we had a Capriotti's in Hawaii. They were voted best sandwiches in Best of Las Vegas so it must be good. Delicious. ...  ... Now I need to do a Capriotti's run and an In-N-Out run since we don't have those in Hawaii.

Love the food love the staff. It's everything I want in a sandwich shop.

REVIEW #38:  5 stars  (398 chars)
Love this location. First of all it's convenient.i it's at Las Vegas Blvd & Silverado Ranch. But more importantly the food is consistently good. I have never eaten a bad sandwich from this shop. Everything is always fresh and tasty. The service is awesome. I love the fact that EVERYONE gets greeted when they walk in, no matter how busy they are. This is my neighborhood Capriotti's and I love it!

REVIEW #39:  5 stars  (523 chars)
O M G!  Capastrami is the best sub I've ever had in my life!  So soft and mushy all at once!!  Yum-mmmmyyy!! ...  ... We also ordered the Homemade Turkey Sandwich (brown bread).  That was delicious, too.   ...  ... For sandwiches, you can order brown bread.  Unfortunately, they don't have brown bread for their subs. ...  ... Take out is probably the best.  Washed our sandwiches and subs down with Sweet Ice Tea.   ...  ... If you ever stayed down in the south end of the strip by Southpointe, they would deliver as well.

REVIEW #40:  5 stars  (149 chars)
Sub was huge, I had the 20" Bobbi and loved it but def couldn't finish the whole sub.. I'll def be back to try some of the other subs that they offer

REVIEW #41:  5 stars  (196 chars)
The best sandwich shop in the universe. Cant add much to that. The Bobbie, Capristrami, Cheesesteak. I have been here a month, and have been to Capriotis at least 8 times. Great bang for the buck.

The Bobbie may be the perfect sandwich ever!  I wish there was a Capriotti's near our house in Laguna Beach!

REVIEW #44:  5 stars  (481 chars)
The bobbie sandwich is the tastiest thing ever. I laughed when family were explaining to me about cranberry and turkey!! i was like ewwww thats nasty! Until they told me to take a bite OMG! it was heaven. I have to try it with hot peppers! it was even better. The capistrami is great too. but my fav is cranberry. The philly cheesesteak is ok! but the bobby and capistrami is a must try! and capriotti's are all over but this one is prolly the best around service and food quality.

REVIEW #45:  5 stars  (109 chars)
The Bobbie was a delicious. Like Thanksgiving in your mouth. It's so good once it hits your lips it's so good

REVIEW #46:  5 stars  (151 chars)
The Caprastrami may be the best sandwich I've ever had anywhere. ...  ... And the guys working there couldn't be any friendlier. What an awesome place!

REVIEW #47:  5 stars  (244 chars)
They make the best philly cheese steak I have ever ate. Super friendly staff. Great service. Do not have to wait forever to get your sandwich. Easy location to get in and out of. Make sure you try it at least once, and I promise you'll be back.

REVIEW #48:  5 stars  (206 chars)
this is the best sandwich shop ever! I always get the Cheese Steak and my husband gets the Cap Pastrami!! Love this place. I always give a tip!! "BEER MONEY" is what they say when someone gives them a tip!!

REVIEW #49:  5 stars  (655 chars)
This place is AMAZING..... Not only do you get a Huge Sandwich, but you get punched in the face with flavor. I have tried a few of the sandwiches that they list and they have all been delicious, The hot pastrami comes with pastrami, " Alot of it I may add" and Cole slaw. I do not like slaw but it was great in the sandwich.  This is no run of the mill sandwich farm, you get more than just a few deli slices and a half a head of lettuce.  ...  ... Dont make the mistake of thinking you are at your ordinary sandwich shop and ordering a large.. It is 20 inches long and probably 6 inches around if not more.  This is worth the trip if you are in the area.

REVIEW #50:  5 stars  (1445 chars)
This place is definitely a must-try if you're in Vegas.  I usually stop by before I start heading back home.  It's sort of weird because when I put the address into my GPS, it led me to the wrong place, but I eventually found it.  The store is small and the workers are really nice.  A downside is that they don't have seating here.  When I went, my friends and I just walked across the lot to the Del Taco and sat there and ate our sandwiches. ...  ... Everything is made to order.  Most of their sandwiches come in three sizes - small 9", medium 12", or a large 20".  They offer a bunch of different sandwiches in different categories, such as Cap's specials, cold subs, hot stuff, and vegetarian.  I love their cheese steak sandwich.  I order mushrooms with it too and it tastes amazing.  I get the medium size and usually I can only finish half of it because I can't finish the rest, which is alright because I have something to eat if I get hungry on the ride back.  The medium sized cheese steak is $8.25, but if you add mushrooms, it's another $0.50.  So the total is a little under $10.  I've only tried the cheese steak one, but my friends love the Bobbie sandwich, which is actually their best-seller.  My friends actually buy a couple of Bobbie sandwiches so they can put in the fridge when they get home and have something to eat later on in the week. ...  ... This place is definitely worth trying.  It's cheap and the food's great.

REVIEW #51:  5 stars  (324 chars)
Walked in and asked what the favorite sandwich is. She said italian, and I said sounds great. 12" sub on really great bread, tasty meats all the fixings, I don't think I could eat the whole sandwich it was filling. I are half and it was perfect. Very friendly staff, like walking into Cheers where everybody knows your name.

REVIEW #52:  5 stars  (281 chars)
We had a vendor treat us to Capriottis.  OMG the Thanksgiving in a sandwich kept me full  the whole day through, certainly a meal I could only have once a year, but it's worth it. Since they brought it to us  I can't review service, or the location, I can surmise from other posts.

REVIEW #53:  5 stars  (753 chars)
We were looking for a place to eat around the area and we had to try a place that has a 4+ star rating. As soon as you look at the place, all you see are awards ranging from 2006 - 2012. Capriotti's Sandwich Shop was voted best sandwich shop in Las Vegas for 6 years. It lives up to the hype and the awards.  ...  ... We tried the Chicken Cheesesteak and the Capastrami. Two amazingly delicious sandwiches. Its hard to put words on paper about the fireworks that was going off in my mouth and satisfaction my tummy felt bite after bite. Next time we are in Las Vegas, We will surly be back and try the Bobbi that everyone else on yelp talks about.  ...  ... Woohoo!!! I can't get enough of Capriotti's Sandwich Shop. Looking forward to trying the Bobbi.

REVIEW #54:  5 stars  (984 chars)
What a hidden gem!  This is a small (about 5-6 tables), strip mall sandwich shop on the south end of town that grills up some delicious subs and sandwiches right before your eyes.  My family of four enjoyed several of the homemade roast turkey sandwiches (my wife said her hot turkey club had incredible flavor).  I tried their Reuben sandwich - it ranks up there with the best I've had, and will definitely order it again.  During our 5-day stay in Vegas, we stopped by twice for lunch.  These guys work hard for your business!  The service and value are outstanding, and they seem to do an enormous amount of carryout, as witnessed by (literally) grocery sacks of subs going out the door with customers during the lunch hour.  To go with your sandwich order, they also offer a variety of bottled sodas and teas, along with family-sized bags of chips (this was nice, as we purchased one bag of chips to share with everyone), and a couple of (what appeared to be) home baked desserts.

REVIEW #55:  5 stars  (246 chars)
Where do I start. The Bobby sandwich is excellent.  There service is great always friendly and the wait time is 10-15 minutes top. I was so happy to find out that's there's another location in Green Valley Casino which is very close to our house.

REVIEW #56:  5 stars  (717 chars)
Where to begin where this delicious sandwich shop!!! I had thirteen guest in my party and we all enjoyed our meals very much. I ordered a medium meatball with provolone cheese and pickles...it was so tasty I bought a second one. My husband ordered the Philly cheese steak and he really enjoyed it. They also ordered the capastrami and we really enjoyed it as well...another sandwich was the turkey....least favorite.  On top of the food being delicious, the staff is amazingly friendly! ...  ... There was nothing bad to say about this place with the exception of the very limited sitting space. There are four tables with three seats each TOTAL. ...  ... IF YOUR IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY STOP BY!!!!

REVIEW #57:  5 stars  (180 chars)
Yum yum yum! I don't really crave things... but I got to say... Capastrami sub is soooo good & sooo big!!! I really like the Cranslam Club on wheat!  ... This location is the BEST!

REVIEW #58:  5 stars  (330 chars)
Yum! Our to go sandwich shop every time we first get into Vegas. The sandwiches are so humongous and delicious.  If you think Earls is good, this place is way better!  The employee there are super nice and will give you what you need.  I love this place every time I come to Vegas! Makes for great leftover for midnight snacking:)

REVIEW #59:  4 stars  (75 chars)
A great selection and great services. Not the best I've had, but very good.

REVIEW #60:  4 stars  (515 chars)
Amazing sandwiches which taste even better than the 8 million pictures on Yelp. I got the bobbie and the capastrami.  ...  ... I love sandwiches, everyone loves sandwiches. These sandwiches are huge and full of flavor. I'm going to offend some people and say these sandwiches are the best in Las Vegas... yes, even better than Earl of Sandwiches. You get way more for your money. I'll be trying the rest of their sandwiches next time i'm in town.  ...  ... This is a another must try spot if you are visiting Vegas.

REVIEW #61:  4 stars  (385 chars)
CAPASTRAMI!!! You have to try this sandwich. I always get the largest one so I can eat it for three meals. The Russian dressing with slaw is so good. I also like the BOBBIE. This is a Thanksgiving dinner in hoagie form. It will definitely satisfy any hunger. The people are always so nice here and they make every sandwich fresh as you order it. Capriottis is my kind of sandwich shop.

REVIEW #62:  4 stars  (395 chars)
Cute little sandwich shop , the people were friendly and helpful , the atmosphere was happy and welcoming , I ordered the cheese steak 9" sub with Gilled onions . The bread was a little soft  for my liking but the steak was cooked perfect and there were plenty of steak , cheese and onions , the prices are very reasonable :) overall very satisfied and would return for another great sandwich :)

REVIEW #63:  4 stars  (342 chars)
First off the food here is good for the price. With large heaps of meat and toppings. In addition the subs here go from large to larger to largest which is a great bang for your buck. Service is good.  ...  ... Why only 4 stars? The food here isn't the best, unique to some degree but it isn't something that cannot be repeated anywhere else.

REVIEW #64:  4 stars  (158 chars)
Gigantic sandwiches. 9" is a small here.  Good cheesesteak. Friendly service. Highway patrol eats here. Very reasonably priced for the portions they give you.

REVIEW #65:  4 stars  (503 chars)
Good sandwiches fast!  In and out in 3 min 35 sec. ... When I'm in a hurry or late for work I always stop at capriotti's ... As I walk in I'm greeted by the person making the sandwiches. ...  " hello, order when you're ready"  ... I'll have an medium Italian. ... "would you like everything in it?" ... Yes please! Easy on the onions. Im on my way to work. ... " name please?" ...  ... They called my name,  paid the cashier, placed tip in jar. ... Cashier- " beer money! "           Crew- " thank you!"

REVIEW #66:  4 stars  (154 chars)
Got sick of Subway on this road trip, so this is a refreshing variety. Friendly staff is always a plus. Too bad we didn't have time to try their hot subs.

REVIEW #67:  4 stars  (790 chars)
Had their capastrami and a turkey sandwich, forgot what that was called buy oh my, it was yums! I've heard so many good things about Capriotti's and never had tried it myself, what a big mistake that was! And for me, I'm not much of a sandwich person, but I sure loved eating this. I had to save half of each for home. Downside is that there isn't a seating area but I don't mind eating in the car. It smelled so good, we couldn't wait, so a couple of napkins and we were set. My boyfriend and I are such big fans. Cole slaw and Russian dressing? Genius idea! I want to order that just as a side because I can't get enough of it. And they don't skimp out on the portions, every sandwich came stuffed, I could not fit my mouth around it. Definitely get your money's worth. Move over, Subway!

REVIEW #68:  4 stars  (375 chars)
Hawaii doesn't have and REALLY NEEDS a sandwich shop like this one. ...  ... The Must-SAMPS sammiches: ... 1. The "Capastrami" is to d-i-e. I love pastrami and this only indulges my love for it even more. ... 2. The "Bobbie" is sweet and salty in one. I'm not a fan of turkey, cranberry, or stuffing during Thanksgiving but, I could mos def eat this all Thanksgiving night!!!

REVIEW #69:  4 stars  (294 chars)
I feel like I'm cheating on The Bobbie - my former favorite sandwich that is pretty much Thanksgiving in a sandwich... BUT I must give a shout-out to my other two loves... the CheeseSteak AND the Capastrami w/ everything on them.  Totally hits the spot when you're craving a "gourmet" sandwich.

REVIEW #70:  4 stars  (738 chars)
I had just arrived in Las Vegas with my teenage daughter and her gymnastics teammate.  All were hungry, so we used Yelp to find the nearest, highest-rated, cheap place to eat.  We ended up at Capriotti's, and I can't wait to eat here again.  On the recommendation of the guy behind the counter, I had The Bobbie, which is turkey with stuffing and cranberry.  I always say the foundation of a good sandwich is great bread, and The Bobbie I had was a great sandwich.  My daughter and her friend had (what I consider boring) turkey sandwiches on wheat bread.  My daughter's sandwich, in particular, wasn't great, but she always orders her sandwiches dry.  Her friend's sandwich had mayo and mustard on it, and she seemed to really like hers.

REVIEW #71:  4 stars  (710 chars)
I have only tried one sandwich here and it's so good I have never wanted or even was curious to try out something else. So my rating is only for this particular sandwich : Chicken Philly with no cheese,grilled onions, mushrooms,sweet & hot red/green peppers and a little mayo...Oh Baby, give it to me....  ... This Capriotti's is uniformly made just like other Capriotti's-service was quick and sufficient. I am sad to see that this Capriotti's doesn't sell Mini "Nothing Bundtcakes" here but instead they serve Tasty Kakes products. People from the East Coast seem to go crazy for Tasty Kakes-I bought the Jelly filled cakes and it was OK, nothing special-I'd rather buy a Twinkie. Anyhow, my sandwich-YUM!!!!

REVIEW #72:  4 stars  (792 chars)
I ordered a Capastrami and a Bobbie. The Capastrami I ate within a few minutes of leaving (it's takeout only, so we ate at South Point). The sandwich was incredible. I have 2 restaurants near me that serve giant pastrami sandwiches with cole slaw, and the one from Capriotti's was definitely competitive. The medium was a great size. ...  ... When I got home to Los Angeles, my girlfriend and I split the Bobbie. It was definitely tasty, but I prefer cream cheese to mayonnaise on my thanksgiving-style sandwiches. The sandwich was a little dry, and only had slightly above average flavor. ...  ... All in all, I would definitely recommend this place to friends, and I will try to visit the Beverly Hills location. I just can't give 5 stars because of the dining situation and the dry Bobbie.

REVIEW #73:  4 stars  (231 chars)
I really love their sandwiches.  The meat they use is fresh, definitely not deli style on their specialty sandwiches.  It is one of my favorite places to get a sandwich that is worth anything...nothing else compares to the quality.

REVIEW #74:  4 stars  (749 chars)
I visit Las Vegas for work a few days out of every month. A few months ago a coworker treated me to one of Capriotti's Sandwich Shop's subs and I liked it, I liked it a lot.  ...  ... The restaurant is a Quiznos Sub Shop or Subway Restaurant type but better. A wide variety or sandwiches and subs, but my personal favorites in the hot steak and cheese with mushrooms, peppers and onions. The clouds part because it's heavenly. I have a few others on my to do list too.  ...  ... 4 stars! Why? It's what I want in a quick and easy sandwich shop. Order in or take out and phenomenal food.  It's a must if and when I visit Las Vegas.  Why not 5 stars?  Not exactly an invited dine in experience but...  Don't think you're not my favorite Cap.  You are!

REVIEW #75:  4 stars  (269 chars)
I've never been a huge fan of Capriotti's but apparently I'm the only one  ...  ... I can't knock the customer service or cleanliness of this location because both are great ...  ... Maybe it's just one of those things that I have to have multiple times to finally love

REVIEW #76:  4 stars  (654 chars)
Nine inches is small? That's the sort of thing that makes me feel inadequate.  ...  ... I mean, must make other sandwich shops feel inadequate. How are any of these other joints supposed to compete when $7 will get you nine fantastic inches of OFFICIAL cheesesteak. $13 will get you 20 inches. That's a lot of sandwich. ...  ... And the Capastrami ain't bad either. I have to admit that I've had better pastrami, but I lived three blocks from Katz's for years, so I'm spoiled. However, I do love the flavor combination. ...  ... The bread, the steak, the smiles, and the value here all justify the enormous wall of awards Capriotti's absolutely deserves.

REVIEW #77:  4 stars  (214 chars)
Primo sandwhiches - I usually go for the philly steak or the Bobbie. Love this location too. Always great service.  ...  ... If I could change anything I wish they would bring back their entertainment book coupons.

REVIEW #78:  4 stars  (181 chars)
Quality sandwiches. I've tried enough of the menu to know that you won't be disappointed with regard to taste, portion, or service. This is the best sandwich chain I've come across.

REVIEW #79:  4 stars  (797 chars)
Thank you YELP! We were in Las Vegas for a day trip (freakin' Time Share presentations) and didn't know where to go for a quick lunch. We looked up the local restaurants on our trusty iPhone app and quickly found this sandwich joint close by. ...  ... I'm not big on sandwiches at all. I mean, come on! I can make a sandwich at home, why eat out for a sandwich. Well, Capriotti's will make me reconsider the art of the sandwich deli. "The Bobbie" sandwich was highly recommended. Wow, fresh roasted chicken shredded for a lovely sub with stuffing, cranberry sauce . It's thanksgiving dinner in a sandwich! Delicious. I definitely think it's the fresh turkey that makes this sandwich so good. It was huge and genorously stuffed (that's what she said!, Sorry, too good to pass up). Thanks Capriotti!

REVIEW #80:  4 stars  (752 chars)
The only thing I ever order is the Bobbie. With a sandwich this good, there is no need to get anything else. The idea of Thanksgiving in a sandwich is brilliant and the person to come up with it should be given an award. Turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce and mayo is the normal combination. I prefer mine with light to little mayo, because the meat is not dry and the cranberry sauce makes sure that the sandwich is not like the Las Vegas landscape.  ...  ... This is a staple for when my friends and I decided to go kayaking down the Colorado River. One small sub was enough to power me through the five to six hour ordeal. Nothing goes along with a day down the river more than a Bobbie in my backpack and some beer dangling behind in the cold river.

REVIEW #81:  4 stars  (395 chars)
They make some good of the best sandwiches I have had.  ...  ... I would stay away from the homemade turkey sandwich on wheat as that was the only sandwich I had there I was not satisfied with. ...  ... I usually get the Capistrami with extra hot peppers or the cheesesteak with extra hot and onions.  ...  ... Always get good friendly service and I call in my order for pickup most of the time.

REVIEW #82:  4 stars  (1093 chars)
This location no longer allows you to eat at the establishment. Take out only.  ...  ... I've tried "the bobbie" in the past. It is with their homemade turkey, cranberry sauce & stuffing. Not a fave of mine, but it is definitely something different and full of yummy thanksgiving flavor anytime of the year.  ...  ... I got a small genoa salami ($6) today and it was HUGE. I couldn't even eat it all and still have half of it waiting in the fridge. All the subs come with provolone cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, onions and choice of sweet or hot peppers, mayo, oil, etc. They don't have a lot of choices in toppings, but pretty much the basics, which is just fine with me! ...  ... The bread is freshly made in house and they are not shy or stingy when it comes to piling on the meat (unlike subway!). After a couple of bites into my sandwich, the fillings were oozing out and couldn't keep up with the bread! By the last bite, I had a little piece of bread with majority of it being meat and lettuce. ...  ... Service here is good, the guys who work there are very friendly. Service is fast too.

REVIEW #83:  4 stars  (277 chars)
We stopped because of the reviews very accurate very good. The place is small not many seats. I had the turkey my wife had the roast beef both were very good. The only thing I did not like was the bread could've been better tasted like a large hot dog bun. ... We will be back!

REVIEW #84:  4 stars  (750 chars)
We stumbled upon this gem due to finding an Indian restaurant for my traditional grandparents that can't digest anything non traditional. I have developed an aversion to Indian food, due to the constant need to find different locales that offer this culinary delight to my grandparent's pleasure. So, when I saw a sandwich shop, I decided to buy a sandwich along with my mother and my aunt. Whenever I frequent Subway, I always order a foot long, due to my voracious and manly appetite. However, you get more than you bargain for and a small is the only size I could envision myself digesting! It's H-U-G-E! And mmm it was delicious :) My taste buds are singing in a symphony of joy when I envision it...I'm going to jump in the car and GO RIGHT NOW!

When I'm hungry I never crave sandwiches. I just feel like its one of those things that I can make at home for much cheaper. BUT i have to admit, Capriotti's is pretty good. The samples sound simple and the menu is limited, but their sandwiches are SOO tasty! Plus I love their huge sizes. A sandwich can feed 3 or 4 people if you're not a big eater. Definitely a stop when you roll into town!

REVIEW #86:  3 stars  (213 chars)
A good sandwich, but I didn't think it was the 'second comming' of subs like some think.  As it is 'take out', no bathroom - not a big deal but inconvenient if traveling like we were.  Convenience store next door.

REVIEW #87:  3 stars  (214 chars)
Got "The Bobbie" to see what all the hype was about. It honestly wasn't the greatest sandwich I've ever tasted referring to the sandwiches back in San Francisco, but it was pretty good. Better than Subway for sure!

REVIEW #88:  3 stars  (1195 chars)
I had never heard of this place before but apparently, there is one in Los Angeles too. Me and my group of friends on our way to Zion National Park in Utah stopped here and I saw a pastrami sandwich so I tried it. After having Langer's Deli in Los Angeles and having their pastrami sandwich, nothing else really compares. Capriotti's Capastrami sandwich does not compare to Langer's legendary #19. The Capastrami comprises of hot pastrami in a roll with cole slaw, swis cheese, and Russian dressing. I added cucumbers and tomatoes to add extra health value to it. Ultimately, the sandwich was oversauced. I could not taste the pastrami at all and I felt a little sick afterwards. ...  ... One of my other friends ordered the "Bobbi" sandwich which consisted of turkey, stuffing, and cranberry sauce to give it the Thanksgiving theme. The sandwich was way too heavy for the quarter portion that I had. One of my other buddies told me that the Italian sandwich was good so maybe I should have gotten that. Either way, this sandwich shop is okay. Not the best I have had, but by and large not the worst. If there had been less sauce on the Capastrami, I would have given this place a higher rating.

REVIEW #89:  3 stars  (624 chars)
I love Capriotti's but I wasn't in love with the service at this location. They weren't super rude; they just seemed...uninterested, almost slightly annoyed that we were ordering. We ordered and then walked to another store and when we came back the cook told us they didn't have enough of the ingredient needed to make the sandwich we ordered. Totally cool, shit happens, but I wish they would've said something when we ordered. Also, there is no soda machine, so be prepared to pay for a can of something. It wasn't terrible, I just wasn't blown away like I've come to expect from Capriotti's. I give them 3 brusque stars.

REVIEW #90:  3 stars  (555 chars)
I went there for lunch and ordered a ham & cheese sub. There was a line of people so it took them about 20 mins to make the sub. The employees were friendly and seemed to be working hard getting all the orders out without too much delay.  ...  ... As for the sub - it was meh! The ingredients seemed fresh enough but the bread was far from the best bread I have had on a sub. Maybe people like it because it is really sweet but I would rather have bread that tastes like bread! Maybe the cooked sandwiches are better but I wouldn't order another cold one.

REVIEW #91:  3 stars  (729 chars)
I've heard about these shops and this one is in my neighborhood, right next to the comic shop I go to. I won't say it's bad, but they have a limited selection of sandwiches and they make you feel like you have to know a secret password to tell them what you wanted on it, or they assumed you knew everything that came on it, even though the menu doesn't say much. The second time I went in there I ordered a Grilled Italian sandwich, and when I said I wanted Mayonnaise, the employee responded with "on the sandwich?" Ummm... I just ordered a sandwich and asked for Mayo, do you think I want it in my soda or spread on my car in the parking lot? YES ON THE SANDWICH! ...  ... I'll stick to Subway, better service and ingredients.

REVIEW #92:  3 stars  (149 chars)
not as good as they used to be. I used to go to Capriotti's allot to get my steak and mushroom sup fix. it was good but not as good as it used to be.

REVIEW #93:  3 stars  (457 chars)
Not the best sandwich I have had, but better than fast food subs. The Bobby was a unique take, but the rest of the menu was kind of so so.  I had the chicken cheese.  The chicken was good, shredded white meat that tasted fresh and the only reason I'm rating three stars. Be advised, if you like hot pepper, the pepper option is pepper relish that wasn't spicy at all.   ...  ... This is a take out place! (no public restroom and not much of a seating area).

REVIEW #94:  3 stars  (350 chars)
Pretty good, I'm still not sure what all the hype is about. I don't go out of my way to go eat here, there's limited seating and they overcharge for their bottled drinks like snapple/pure leaf tea etc.I paid $2.99 for a pure leaf tea and saw it at Vons that same day for $1.00. ...  ... They only have white bread no wheat or healthier selections....

I don't know, I think its overrated. its nothing too special. they over load their sandwiches with mayonnaise, butter, and other oily fats. maybe it's just me since i'm a bit of a health freak. butttt my boyfriend is all about it.

REVIEW #98:  2 stars  (588 chars)
I love Capriotti's. Unfortunately, this location disappoints me. I am subjected to go to this location because it is the only one close to me. What I really dislike about this particular location is that they squish the bread so much! If anyone from this location ever reads this please stop squishing the bread while you're packing the sandwich. Every single time I come here the bread always ends up looking so thin and squished. I didn't order a flatbread sandwich. I want a nice and fluffy bread for my sandwich. I'll change my rating only if they stop squishing the bread so much. =\

REVIEW #99:  2 stars  (411 chars)
Sandwich sizes were HUGE.  The place wasn't the cleanest and had NO SEATING or apparent bathrooms.  Yes, the Bobby tastes like thanksgiving, but a mess of a half-hearted thanksgiving it was.  I'll wait until November next time, thank you.  The Italian sandwich my wife had was nice.  Bread was hardly better than Subway.  An alright place to eat if you are hungry but I won't be going out of my way to get here.

REVIEW #100:  2 stars  (363 chars)
Seriously? ... My cheesesteak had barely any meat inside. It was a pathetic combination of meat to bread. Are you that incompetent that you can't even compile a correct sandwich together. They must have been in a rush. THE QUALITY IS LACKING. ... What a shame... I thought I lucked out having it so close to my house. I'll stick to the one on paradise and harmon.

Best and closest Philly cheesesteak ever . They even add the sauce correctly after I asked them too and had the correct ingredients to add as well. Anothernall busness that I well worth the visit. Service was great and friendly they even had chips you can get back east . Really pleased and highly recommend this to everyone.

Great customer service, awesome food, and I dig their "beer money" tip jar & how they give me a thank you jingle when I drop some cash in there!

REVIEW #3:  5 stars  (265 chars)
Home of the Bobbie-basically a Thanksgiving dinner on a roll so that's turkey, cranberry and stuffing, mayo if you want it.  The sandwich's are huge and filling, good to share.  ...  ... Other good ones are the Capistrami and the Eggplant parmesan!  Wonderful! Yum!

REVIEW #4:  5 stars  (408 chars)
I had the same sandwich twice, once it was the last left over piece on a party tray and it got me salivating at what a fresh sandwich might taste like. I forgot the name of the sandwich but it had I think pastrami and this kick ass pastrami on it that really counteracted the meat to perfection. Fresh is definitely better. It's a shame that the sandwiches aren't larger though, that would have been awesome.

REVIEW #5:  5 stars  (348 chars)
I used to work in a sandwich shop and this place is one of my favorites. They prepare everything after you order which is awesome, takes time but is totally worth it.  ...  ... Another plus is that they have big bags of chips, most places only have the regular bags so it's a plus. Guys working in this location are really nice. Quick and friendly.

REVIEW #6:  5 stars  (1130 chars)
I'm a Capriotti's fan. I eat at one 1-2 times a week. This is one location I love because not only is it tasty but it is near a Home Depot I frequent.  ...  ... The store is clean. The dining area isn't very big so I usually phone my order in and pick it up to go. During lunch hours this location is a mad house and can get cramped but obviously worth it! ...  ... I like that Capriotti's has been giving a $3 coupon on some receipts I get. Not sure how long it will last but as long as it is around I will be appreciative! Pay attention to your receipt you might have one on there. You do have to go to a website and fill out a brief survey but it is quick and worth the discount. ...  ... I'm a sucker for a "Capastrami". It has Pastrami, Swiss, Cole Slaw, and Russian Dressing on a hoagie roll. It is pure heaven with each bite. ...  ... They have a variety of sandwiches to choose from. ...  ... Should you be a fan of the "tastykake" brand they carry a variety of their snacks. The "Wise" brand chips are my fav. ...  ... Sandwich sizes are as follows: ... -Small is 9 inches ... -Medium is 12 inches ... -Large is 20 inches

REVIEW #8:  5 stars  (2735 chars)
My husband and I love Capriotti's, and have been regular customers of the Craig Road/Home Depot shop for a decade. We can honestly say that we have never had a bad meal. The consistency of high quality subs and the great variety make this a place we can't resist, no matter what our bathroom scales may say! We've never had guests that we haven't treated to Capriotti's, and we've never had a rude encounter with any of the staff.  ...  ... Some marvelous subs to try - great with a group, where everyone shares:  ...  ... Capistram--melt-in-your mouth pastrami with no gristle or excess fat. Both the swiss and provolone cheeses add another layer of flavor to the pastrami. The Russian dressing pulls it all together. The Cole Slaw adds texture and juice. Bibs might be advised, since this sub can be drippy-licious.  ...  ... The Bobbie -- Thanksgiving on a sub, just the way we like it: Turkey, cranberry sauce, stuffing and mayo. When we have Thanksgiving at someone's home, and we don't get leftovers, we like to stop at Caparotti's the next day so we can pretend we're enjoying all those yumdiddy-great leftovers.  ...  ... Cole Turkey -- a "Bobbie" without the cranberry sauce or stuffing. For those who want to assuage their after-Thanksgiving guilt by avoiding sweet cranberry sauce and an extra bread product. I still like it loaded full-tilt-boogie with the entire table of treats! ...  ... Slaw Be Jo - thinly sliced roast beef, tender and moist, lathered with Russian dressing, mayo and their sweet-savory cole slaw, topped with provolone cheese. It's a toss up when you're in a beef mood whether the Slaw Be Jo or the Cheese Steak is the tastiest. We normally rely on a coin flip, since our taste buds crave both!  ...  ... I don't do red sauce so I rely on the opinion of guests from out of town who tell us they love the Sausage sub with marinara sauce, as well as the meatball sub. I'm also not an italian meat and hot pepper fan, so again, I rely on the opinions of those who love this combination.  ...  ... Yes, I hear you. What the heck am I doing living in Las Vegas if I don't love Italian or Mexican food? Fortunately, at Capriotti's, there are choices to suit everyone's taste buds.  ...  ... I've yet to taste a better cheesesteak anywhere in the valley, nor a finer hot pastrami.  ...  ... Note to service dog users: the staff is welcoming to service dogs, and you won't have any problem with access. They keep their distance, practice good service dog etiquette by not trying to pet the service dogs, and always take time to remark about how well mannered they are.  ...  ... I only wish I had some photos to share, but the truth is, I'm always so anxious for that first bite that I forget to aim the phone.

What can be said about Caps' Bobby? Everything, it's my favorite all time sandwich! It's the best. This location has very friendly people and it's always clean and nice. We always stop by here on our way out of town and they have no problem with making my wife her special sandwich.

REVIEW #16:  4 stars  (328 chars)
Coming from the South Bay, when I lived in Sin City I totally missed sandwiches from Togos. So imagine my excitement when some co-workers put me on to Capriotti's. The sandwiches here are amazing! My faves are the Capistrami and the Bobbie - which is totally like a little bit of Thanksgiving.. all you need is some pumpkin pie.

REVIEW #17:  4 stars  (246 chars)
Excellent sandwhiches. I usually get the Capastrami and/or The Bobbie. I'd choose this place over Subway or Quiznos any day. A little more pricey, but welll worth it my opinon. Lunch hours can get busy. Therefore call in your order ahead of time.

REVIEW #18:  4 stars  (348 chars)
For a sandwich shop with a limited selection they really bring their A game. I cant remember the name of my sandwich but it was a hot sandwich with schredded chicken and all of the extra goodies on top with a special sauce. It was quite delicious ....so if I were you and in the area of this shop I'd definately go check it out =) small but good =)

REVIEW #19:  4 stars  (135 chars)
I have to agree with all the other Yelp reviews...tried the Bobbie and love it!  I'm from Dallas and wish there was one closer to home.

REVIEW #20:  4 stars  (401 chars)
I'm from LA. Nothing will ever compare to Johnny Pastrami but this satisfies me pretty good until then. Husband gets the Capastrami, which i have to admit looked AMAZING. However I wanted a regular Hot Pastrami, not on the menu but they made it for me. :) Enough of each sauce, pickles and $20 for 2 medium (footlong) subs. We eat here about once a month for our Pastrami cravings, no complaints. YUM.

REVIEW #21:  4 stars  (1098 chars)
I've always been a fan of Capriotti's and still think that they have some of the best cheese steaks in Las Vegas.  This particular Cap is located in North Las Vegas in the Home Depot shopping center.  It's a small restuarant with limited tables/chairs inside and a few more outside.   ...  ... Cap sells their sandwiches in 3 sizes; 9 inch, 12 inch, and their monster 20 inch.  I have friends that recommend the Bobbi (turkey and cranberry) and their Capastrami (their pastrami swiss).  I am told both these sandwiches are really good.  However, I've yet to try either.  I've only tried two different subs here; they're steak/cheese and chicken/cheese.  Both meats are thinly sliced, seasoned, and coated in melted cheese.  I usually have both sandwiches plain so that I can savor the meats more.  You can't go wrong with either sandwich.  Simply state, both are delicious.  ...  ... Service is not bad at all and really depends on how busy they are.  Between 11:30 AM and 1 PM, this place can be a madhouse.  Cap is little more pricey compared to say  ... Subway, but the food here is much better.

REVIEW #24:  4 stars  (1148 chars)
There's not much that I can say that hasn't already been said.  Cap's serves a mean sandwich.  No, they serve an amazing sandwich. I can have it for every meal when I'm in town.  I've only tried one variety though, because it was so fantastic, I've never felt the need to try anything else! I tried Caps' for the first time at a Yelp Elite event, and  made my friends take me there immediately for a full-size sandwich experience.  I didn't realize it was a chain until much later, as they don't have Cap's where I live, so sad.  ...  ... My one true sandwich love: The Bobbie.  Turkey, cranberries, and stuffing.  I've tried to replicate it at home, and I can't even come close They must sprinkle it with magic.  It's not the cheapest sandwich in town, but you get what you pay for.  I need to try other sandwiches to see if they're just as fab, and if so, they definitely deserve a 5-star rating.  ...  ... This location is one of my favorites - it's  fast and friendly, with plenty of room to sit and enjoy your sandwich.  They also give military discounts, and if you check in on Yelp, they usually have a check-in offer (not all locations do).

REVIEW #25:  4 stars  (206 chars)
This is my favorite sandwich place in Vegas. I recommend the Capistrami or the Bobby, they are amazing. Also a good tip is to go with a friend and split a 20" sandwich, makes it significantly cheaper there!

REVIEW #26:  4 stars  (1313 chars)
This is one of the two capriotti's I've been too. Which is a bit more convenient for me, since its just down the street from where I live. The second one, is at Aliante Station.  ...  ... Focusing on this Sandwich Shop, I have to say that this is unique in it's own sense. There are some things I do like about it, and other things that I don't like. But the most important thing is, their sandwiches are great. I'm not sure about other Capriotti's, but I know that Aliante doesn't have it, but this Capriotti's has their 20 inch sandwich. That's why I like this place I love their LARGE sandwiches. I do like their staff, which is nice and friendly. Despite the fact of them being busy, they still tend to be upbeat.  ...  ... On the other hand, even though their location is convenient. Mainly off Craig and MLK next to Pet Smart and Home Depot. It is a small sandwich shop. When it gets busy, its kind of uncomfortable standing around for a sandwich. They only have 3 small tables, and a few worn out chairs. The floor itself, seen better days.  ...  ... Overall, I would suggest this place for their sandwiches, but not so much on dining in. They do have a few tables outside, but I would just go their for pick up. Their sandwiches are great, their staff is great. That's all I need to go to Capriotti's for.

REVIEW #27:  4 stars  (202 chars)

REVIEW #29:  3 stars  (686 chars)
I love Capriotti's sandwiches, no matter what shop I've gone to the food is pretty much the same.  This one in particular is not in a casino and is seriously lacking some fung shui.  There is no order counter here, you just walk up to the edge of the kitchen to place your order and to pick it up.  If you've never been here it would be easy just to keep walking right into the kitchen.  The dinning area is tiny but they have a few tables outside.  Last time I went in there I ordered two items, and they wrote them down.  Yet somehow they failed to get it correct.  Still enjoyed them because it's Cap's and it was still good.  I wish they would make the bobbie hot though... booh-hoo

REVIEW #30:  3 stars  (1062 chars)
If you know me, you know I LOVE sandwiches. I mean love.  Love.  ...  ... I tried the turkey on white which included lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, red peppers and jalepeno with a little mayo...the flavors were great but it was super dry. My bread was also a bit hard. My other half ordered the Capastrami and the bread was very soft with a wonderful flavor. I was jealous. Oh, if you check in you get a free large drink so that was cool.  ...  ... The inside has seating for about 14 people. The table we waited at was so wobbly we couldn't touch it without our drinks almost tipping over.  ...  ... After 21 min I had to ask them what's up with our order. In doing so I realized the customers at this location were NOT as important as all of the call in orders (note to self). The lady I asked literally walked in a circle them told me "it'll be up soon."  ...  ... Uuuuh ok...6 min later our order was ready to go.  ...  ... I have a bad taste in my mouth about this location. Think I'll stick with Jersey Mikes,  jimmy johns, and firehouse over this place.

REVIEW #31:  3 stars  (1064 chars)
This Capriotti's location is the closest one to my job, so a couple times a month when I just need a sandwich to get me through the day, I'll opt for Capriotti's. ...  ... It's your standard Capriotti's-pretty small on the inside, nothing fancy. The employees are nice and the dining area is always clean. I wouldn't suggest making plans to dine here during the lunch hours though. This location is always packed and if you don't want to wait, call your order in. I always do and my sandwich is always ready and waiting so I don't have to wait awkwardly in the dining area and watch other people get to enjoy their tasty sandwiches. ...  ... I really like their selection of chips which I don't think you can really get anywhere else and the fact that they offer Tastykakes, which I've never had, but have read enough Stephanie Plum books to appreciate the novelty. ...  ... I guess my only beef with Capriotti's is that they serve Pepsi. That's a personal preference though, so I just never get drinks here.  ...  ... Bottom line: average Capriotti's, call ahead.

REVIEW #32:  3 stars  (214 chars)
This is a nice little place that has some pretty good sandwich's. I got the vegetarian turkey sandwich they also have vegetarian cheese steak (unfortunately no vegan cheese) , but its nice to have some veg options.

REVIEW #33:  3 stars  (1002 chars)
This place is small, located in the strip mall on Craig, next to the Pets Mart. After picking up some doggy items my boyfriend and I stopped here to grab some sandwiches to go on a Saturday afternoon. ...  ... I went in to order while my boyfriend kept our four-legged friend busy outside where they have some tables set up for out-door eating. Um, too bad it stinks outside right around the area of the store though. Definitely not appetizing to eat sandwiches around a sewer-like smell. ...  ... I have given Capriotti's a 5-Star Review before, but this was kind of "meh". I'm bumping it up to 3-Stars though because the Bobbie was yummy per usual. Unlike a lot of people, I'm not a regular at Capriotti's because I'm more of a Port of Subs girl for my go-to sandwich. However, Capriotti's hits the spot sometimes. ...  ... This location is tiny by the way and there's not much seating to speak of inside. Also, the set up to pay/get your sandwich/get your drinks is a little clumsy to say the least.

REVIEW #34:  3 stars  (725 chars)
This place would earn a higher rating from me if they took a little care in making the sandwiches. The ingredients are of high quality, but are used inconsistently and carelessly when the sandwich is made. It is not as if I am surprised, as they are assembled by young lads and lasses who are probably making something akin to minimum wage. Speaking of which, I find it a tad odd that these youthful people call their tips "beer money." Do they take the tips and wait outside a gas station, trying to convince patrons to buy them a twelver? Maybe they should call the tips "candy money" or whatever it is American youngins buy today. Old man rants aside, the sandwiches here are very good, and it is a great fast food option.

REVIEW #35:  3 stars  (661 chars)
This was my third time here. Came here for lunch today and had the Italian. It was ok. The second time, I had the Meatball. It wasn't that good. The first time, I had the Mushroom Cheesesteak. It was the best out of what I've tried so far. ...  ... The place is pretty small. There are four or five tables and a tv playing the ESPN channel. There are also some tables outside. The staff is always friendly. ...  ... I paid with my card on my first visit and their is a offer to get $3 off on your next visit if you do an online survey. I didn't get that offer on my second or third visit when I paid in cash. My buddy who paid with his card today got the offer.

REVIEW #36:  2 stars  (618 chars)
One star because the guys behind the counter were sweet and nice. Another because of price. ...  ... In short, my sandwich sucked and am upset because the guy recommended me to get the sandwich over my original order... it was the turkey something... which was pretty much a thanksgiving meal on wheat bread (turkey meat, cranberry, gravy). I ate the whole thing because I eat everything and because I was starving! ...  ... My cousin who is a local swears by this place. I apparently did not order the right thing. I had a taste of her sandwich (pastrami) and it was soo much better - wish I had ordered the pastrami.

REVIEW #37:  2 stars  (808 chars)
PROS:  ... I had just flown into Vegas and was in need of food before I head to the clubs to get wasted! My friends who are Las Vegas residents swear by this place but I don't understand why. The only Pro this place deserves in convenience.  ...  ... CONS:  ... I ordered my sandwich..they were barely paying attention, I had to repeat my order 3 times. How hard is it to understand Turkey on wheat with extra mustard? Extra Mayo? The guys said? NO!!!!! Extra mustard! YELLOW! YELLOW! YELLOW!!!!!! then to top off this horrible experience, the dude hands me my sandwich (foot long) without a bag while he gave my other friends their sandwiches in bags.  ...  ... HELLLLLLO!?!?!?! Can I get a bag? dumbass!  ... Got home, the sandwich sucked! Wish I would went to Subway!  ...  ... FINAL ANSWER: GO to Subway!

REVIEW #38:  2 stars  (143 chars)
There's only one good sandwich here, and it's the Bobbie. Capriotti's is overpriced and I suggest that you look elsewhere for  decent sandwich.

Hmmm ... Philly Cheese Steaks. It is such a comfort food.  ...  ... I stayed at the Aliante Resort and ate here twice. My first sandwich was so delicious I decided the next day to order another one. The second wasn't as amazing but it still hit the spot. The sandwich is a little pricey costing me around $10. And that does not include chips or drinks. My cheap butt decided to have a cup of water instead.  ...  ... When I am back in LA, I will definitely stop by

They have online ordering so if you're in a rush to see a movie, this is a nice bonus and can pay for it ahead of time. The bobby here was just as good as other Capriottis. The order placed was exactly right. Made our movie in time!

REVIEW #5:  3 stars  (559 chars)
Part of the group wanted Capriotti's and the others wanted Rubio's. It worked out well because the food court at the Aliante Casino has both. I went with Cap's and got the Slaw Be Joe. I love this sandwich. The combination of roast beef, cole slaw and Russian dressing is fantastic. They did it up right with generous portion sizes. One in the group got the cheese steak and said it was great. The other got the ever popular Bobbie, which was overly heavy on the cranberry. The staff was friendly and I got a free large fountain drink for my check-in on Yelp.

So far I have been underwhelmed by my two experiences here.  I found the employees to be friendly, and the food tasted fairly good.  But there was just no pizzazz to it, and in each case it took about 20 minutes to receive my freshly prepared order.   ...  ... On my latest outing I ordered a 12" Cheese Steak with Mushrooms, Sweet Peppers, and Fried Onions.  The grinder was cheesy and filling, but contained well done pieces of beef and was not that satisfying.  A generous amount of ketchup was provided on request as a dip, which perked up the taste of the sandwich somewhat.  Only potato chips are available here, although in each case I would have definitely preferred French Fries to go with my sub.  Upon checking into Yelp, I received a free large fountain drink of my choice.  I opted for Dr. Pepper, and appreciated the gesture.

If you happen to find yourself at the food court in Aliante Station, I would suggest you save yourself the hassle and skip Capriotti's. ...  ... I hate to say it because I really like Capriotti's (see my review here: http://www.yelp.com/biz/capriottis-sandwich-shop-las-vegas?q=nicole) and because this location is the closest to my house.  But I have had too many problems here that I have now decided I will either drive further if I need my sandwich fix or find somewhere else to eat. ...  ... Of the four times I have eaten at this location, I have had problems during three of them. ...  ... 1.  We had a 30 minute wait for 2 sandwiches. ... 2.  We ordered two medium sandwiches but when we got home we realized that one was clearly a small. ... 3.  We ordered one small and one medium sandwich but were charged for two mediums.  The employee noticed his mistake after charging our card and said there was nothing he could do except offer us a bag of chips (which we don't eat).  Also, my husband's Veg Cole Turkey was very skimped on toppings. ...  ... It's a good thing I know how good the customer service and quality of food is at the other locations.  Otherwise, if this was my only experience I'm not sure I'd bother with a Capriotti's again. ...  ... Located in the Aliante Station food court next to the movie theater.  Note: They do not sell large-sized sandwiches.

Been to other Capriottis in town & this favors the least. My order is always the same & have received it consistently in other locations. My large Philly Cheese Steak did not look like a large at all. It looked deflated, squished, lacked meat and cheese. Other locations are extremely generous, taking pride in their sandwiches. This one seems to not do so. Sandwich should be divine if I'm paying $9 for it. Just saying.

REVIEW #9:  1 stars  (374 chars)
Have been to several Caps around the valley many times, always a consistent brand. This was my second visit to this location, both times have been sub par. Last night was the same. Actually watched the guy making my Bobby picking and eating meat while making my sandwich. Blah. The overall appearance of the place was nasty and dirty. Will not be returning to this location.

As a vegan who has recently moved from Los Angeles to America's Dairyland, I literally jump for joy any time I see something on a menu that I can eat that isn't just bread and garnish veggies.  As I pondered their menu this weekend, I noticed the vegetarian symbol next to a "turkey" sandwich.  I asked the girl what that meant, and she said that it was a turkey substitute made out of vegetable protein!  Now, I'm not a vegan who is into fake meats and cheeses, but I'll give anything a chance, and like I said before, was just excited to see more than one option on the menu.  My sandwich came out, and it was massive!  I failed to look at the actual sizes on the menu...so I figured my "small" would be like a Subway 6 inch...wrong!  Nine inches of vegan heaven is what I indulged in.  Thanks so much, Capriottis, for catering to all different dietary needs with your menu!!!  This is definitely going to be a lunchtime staple for me now, as I work right down the street!

Best fast food joint in Madison.

REVIEW #3:  5 stars  (344 chars)
By far the best sandwich shop ever!  The real pulled turkey is key.  This not "lunchmeat" turkey, it is the shredded, pulled thanksgiving kind!  The Cole Turkey is my favorite and my family loves the Bobbie, thanksgiving in a bun!  I am so happy there is a location in Wisconsin!  We frequent here at least once a month driving from Beloit, WI.

REVIEW #5:  5 stars  (657 chars)
I know this place is a chain and all but MY GOD are their subs delicious. Specifically this location for some reason seems to get it right every time. I have NEVER had a bad experience here! Now this location specifically is located in a great place because HUNDREDS of people pass it everday. Every lunch time, its packed. Weekends, packed, some weeknights dinner time, packed. ITS GREAT. This place is always clean, the staff is INCREDIBLY nice and super fast with making the sandwiches. My favorite? The Cole Turkey. Extremely bad for you but you know what? This place is well worth it. Great... now I'm craving it... welp! I guess it's Capriotti's time!

REVIEW #6:  5 stars  (182 chars)
I love the capastromi cheese steak is good too! If only it fit with my everyday healthy diet. I'd be here everyday! I always get a large and eat some today n save the rest for later.

REVIEW #7:  5 stars  (1281 chars)
MUST TRY!!!!  ...  ... I have always loved Silver Mine subs in Madison and I'm not a huge fan of the chains, Subway, Milo's and Cousins...etc. I almost went to Cousins and then I saw Capriotti's when I was driving down the road. I said what the heck let's try it out, I could always go for a good Italian sub, which is what the name sounded like. So I was confused when I walked in, some of the sandwich's looked weird with stuffing and coleslaw and what not. The guy at the counter told me what was on everything and he was super helpful.  ...  ... So I decided to go with the Grilled Italian: Genoa salami, capicola ham, prosciuttini (peppered ham) & provolone; grilled. I should have gotten peppers on it but I got a small and it was huge and the meat and taste was unbelievable. This place is a hidden gem!  ...  ... I came back to the office and handed all my coworkers a menu and said you will thank me later after you go and try it. I will definitely be going back there this week and trying the turkey as the meat is made fresh every day. I was nervous the bread would be hard but it was thick and soft. I have had my fair share of subs in the day, my favorite was Lindy's in Lacrosse but now just 2 blocks up the road from my work is my new favorite place. CAPRIOTTI'S!!!!

REVIEW #8:  5 stars  (458 chars)
This is what a sandwich shop should be.  As noted by others, their turkey rocks.  It's actual roasted / pulled turkey meat & not the Oscar Meyer (sorry not a fan) lunchmeat you find at Subway.  Don't even think about getting anything larger than a medium - trust me I've tried & failed.   Attentive staff + fresh & delicious ingredients, = a great sandwich - watch out Cousin's, Milios, Subway, etc...there's a new kid in town & they know what they're doing.

REVIEW #9:  5 stars  (573 chars)
Wow. Just wow. These sandwiches are excellent. Usually you don't get stuff this good from franchised (fast food) places, but this really blew me away. The prices are a little bit higher than usual ($6.75 for 6', $8 for 12' and $13 for large [can't remember the length]), but not much and the quality more than makes up for it. For comparisons, think Jimmy John's (but better) more than Subway or Quiznos, since the quality is more like a deli than fast food. Finally, like others have said, their specialty is turkey (carved), though they do have other (delicious) options.

REVIEW #10:  4 stars  (1192 chars)
As other reviews have mentioned, the turkey is really the highlight here at Capriotti's.  I'm not usually a fan of turkey sandwiches, because sliced turkey tends to be kind of dismal, but Capriotti's turkey is pulled and it makes for a delicious sandwich.   ...  ... The other things I've tried have been good too.  The roast beef is nice, although it doesn't crush its competitors as convincingly as the turkey does.  The Capastrami (hot pastrami, coleslaw, Swiss cheese, and Russian dressing) was a little odd but perfectly edible.  The Swiss cheese was essentially undetectable, but that's okay with me since Swiss is probably my least favorite cheese. ...  ... All the subs are served on great bread (soft, but still substantial enough to not fall apart after being inundated with mayo and piled high with fixings) and come in one of three sizes (9, 12, or 20 inch).  The prices are very good, so even a sub capable of feeding you for two days is affordable. ...  ... Capriotti's seems like the kind of place that would do well downtown.  There's not much reason to go out to the far west side where they're located, but if you ever find yourself out there, you should definitely stop in.

REVIEW #11:  4 stars  (608 chars)
Love the homemade turkey, it really fills you up and as mentioned by other reviewers the meat is very high quality.   ...  ... They  could stand to upgrade the plain iceberg lettuce and offer a large variety of dressings, but these are minor items. ...  ... While the food is very good, I'm not a huge fan of the ordering system...you put your order in and hang out for them to call your name at tables.  If they could do an assembly line system like every other sub place, it might be a little less awkward.  The parking situation in this complex can suck at times; they really need to expand the lot. ... .

REVIEW #12:  4 stars  (3107 chars)
Oh Capriotti's, why must your sandwiches be so tasty (and borderline addictive)? My journey to Capriotti's was only a matter of time. I hear the buzz of 'free sandwiches' going around the office for a place called Capriotti's at their new location. Alright, I missed that opportunity, but a place that will offer free subs is a place that I need to check out. A few weeks went by and I had forgotten the name (insert sad face). Then my boss comes in with a sub in an nondenominational wrapper (my way of saying it was just a plain wrapping paper - no logo), as he opens it I can smell how delicious it would taste. No sooner did he say how tasty it was (a Chicken Philly Cheese Steak), it was gone. Too good to just let it sit idly? Alright, now I have to try it. ...  ... So the following day, I made it a point to stop there for lunch. I got the same thing that taunted my olfactory perception the day before. Chicken Cheese Steak, as they call it, is one of their 'hot stuff' options. Back to the office I returned with it, and finished it in a short amount of time! Did this sandwich really just happen or had I dreamt it into existence? Okay, I had to go back again to make sure it was as good as I thought it was. ...  ... This time I tried their Cran-Slam Club with turkey and cranberries. I missed the part where they said they used three slices of bread. I looked at this thick sandwich and wondered how I was going to fit it in my mouth. Well, don't worry - I figured that out. Surprisingly, the extra slice of bread enhanced the sandwich. I think I was full after I finished it too. It's a tongue twister to order too, I accidentally called it the Cran-Clam Slub (or Cran-Crab Club) - which I'd be interested to try as well. ...  ... I can see myself returning for more sandwiches, like I said before - they're borderline addictive. Either I need to stop now or just accept it. But, I am only giving this spot 4 out of 5 stars. The rent is just too damn high! Woops (right meme, wrong phrase) - the pricing is a bit high. I can't justify the price to myself to eat there regularly enough for it to become a weekly stop. I do appreciate the 3 sizes that their subs come in, but adjust those prices a bit and you'll become irresistible ...  ... The other complaint I have is specific to this location, the convenience of getting to this location absolutely sucks. One entrance only. First trip here, I turned early and got myself nearly lost in a random neighborhood and had to come back out to find the only entrance. Then when you get into the parking lot, you have to go to the furthest section of the parking lot. Exiting sucks too, I thought I was leaving, turns out I accidentally found the underground parking for the building. ...  ... Give me easy access and I will surely tell all my friends of the positive experience I had. But when you're annoyed coming in - enjoy a great meal - and leave frustrated with the lack of accessibility, it'll leave you with a bitter taste in your mouth. Not necessarily Capriotti's fault - but they picked that location and they should have picked better.

REVIEW #13:  4 stars  (1427 chars)
Oh, dear turkey sandwich made out of identifiable turkey and not pressed lunch meat, I love you. ...  ... I am a big fan of sandwiches. I remember seeing Capriotti's on the Food Network, and was pumped to find out they were opening a Madison location. Capriotti's thing is giant sandwiches (a small is 9") and focusing on pulled turkey.  ...  ... We ordered a few different things, and I sampled the roast beef sandwich on a kaiser roll with cheese, lettuce, tomato, mayo, and seasoning, and their signature, The Bobbie - aka Thanksgiving on a roll. ...  ... I really liked the roast beef. Also pulled, it reminds me of the oh-so-tasty pot roast sandwich that only homemade leftovers have provided me with up until this point.  ...  ... The Bobbie was also good, but I think for me it'd be a once or twice a year thing. The turkey was tasty, the stuffing absolutely delish, and cranberries very sweet. If the cranberries fell more on the tart side than the gooey, sweet side, I'd maybe be obsessed - which is a surprise because for the most part I am all sorts of against mixing up my food. My dad always says, "It's all going to the same place," but I've always been closer to the "my corn can't touch my mashed potatoes" end of things. ...  ... Anyway, the point is that for $7 you can get a giant sandwich featuring home-cooked-style meat and crunchy veggies. Definitely a step above Subway, Silver Mine, and *barf* Cousins.

REVIEW #14:  4 stars  (332 chars)
Rating: 3.8 ... Short description:  Sandwich shop ... Pluses:  Decent sandwiches, some unique styles like the turkey dinner version.   ... Negatives:  Tad expensive, Confused a 'cheese sandwich' with a 'cheesesteak sandwich', but was still very happy with it. ... Recommendations:  I was really happy with the cheese steak sandwich.

REVIEW #15:  4 stars  (1482 chars)
The big deal with Capriotti's is the turkey.  It's pulled roast turkey, not cold cuts.  The other crucial component to their sandwiches is they have pretty substantial rolls.  So here's the rundown of what I've had.  ...  ... The Bobbie: Turkey, stuffing and cranberry sauce--cold.  It's an interesting combo, but kinda works.  I was sucked in by this gimmick.  I've eaten a few.  I like them.   ...  ... Grilled Italian: Genoa salami, capicola ham, prosciuttini (peppered ham) & provolone; grilled.  Dang tasty if you're looking for some greasy deliciousness.  Especially w/ hot peppers.  You can also get this as a cold sub if you prefer.  ...  ... Cheese steak: This one is kinda meh.  Not very great.  If you really want a proper cheese steak then go to Big Red's downtown. ...  ... Turkey sub: To me, this is the real standout.  Pulled roast turkey, provolone, "seasonings," and whatever other veggies.  I like mine with no onions, add mayo, pickles & hot peppers.  Oh boy.  Delicious.  I can eat a 12" and then feel ready to eat the whole thing again. ...  ... Having gotten to the turkey sub, I'm pretty much sticking with it.  I might try something else at some point but right now I'm kind of hooked on the turkey.  ...  ... Their one final gimmick is that a 12" sub is a medium  A large is 20".  I could almost eat a 20" turkey by myself.  I might just do it in a moment of weakness.  ...  ... The owners of the Cousins franchise around the corner should be a bit worried.

REVIEW #16:  4 stars  (3190 chars)
TL;DR Fresh, Excellent Food, no processed deli meats, nice friendly staff and service. Uses Belly Rewards. Good value for $ ...  ... Service: I've always been greeted by a smile and staff is polite and positive. I've never had to wait too long for my order to be prepped. The staff is knowledgeable about their product and will make recommendations for toppings.  ...  ... Atmosphere: The place is clean (i haven't seen the bathrooms) and organized. I've also never dined in, always carry out. The seating is minimal, but comparable to competitor sandwich shops in the vicinity. Bonus, Capriotti's has a TV tuned into news or sports, which is a step up from it's competitors. ...  ... Food: I've had the Bobbie, the chicken cheesesteak, beef cheesesteak, and Cole Turkey. ... I've always found the food to be fresh, tasty, and well combined. Let's be clear, don't come to Capriotti's if you are on a diet or don't do 'the fixin's. Capriotti's sandwiches aren't an assembly line product like most chain stores. They are works of gastronomic art. In order to understand and taste the full effect of the art, you don't mess with the product. Get the slaw, get the onions, peppers, and mushrooms, and get the dressings. Not choosing to do so is comparable to viewing Van Gogh's 'Starry Night' without any of the yellow pigments. It's nice, but not nearly as awe inspiring as experiencing it as the artist designed it to be.  ...  ... Major bonus points for using non processed deli meats. 'Real' roasted turkey and beef make a big difference. Listen, when I was pregnant and craving roast beef sandwiches, this is where I'd head. (FYI, you aren't supposed to eat  processed 'deli' meat when preggo. Just in case you didn't know). The meat makes a world of difference. Every time I take a cheese steak back to work, I have at least 4 people drift to my desk asking me what that delectable smell is. So at the very least, you can be the envy of the office lunch crowd.  ...  ... Cons: The calorie count. If I was a lucky person who could eat whatever I want and not gain an ounce, I'd be there every day. But, because you really need all the fixin's to truly enjoy the food, it's a 'once in awhile'' treat for me. While they do offer lower calorie options, let's be real, the reason you go here is for Thanksgiving in a sandwich or a delicious, greasy, cheesy cheesesteak.  ...  ... Pros: Good value for the money spent, at least in my opinion. The small is a 9" and I've never gotten a larger size. For $7-8 at most assembly line chain stores, you get a 6' sandwich with 4 thin slices of processed deli meats. Not so at Cappriotti's. That thing is piled high with meat and fixin's. I always just get a small sandwich and it's more than satisfying and filling.  ... Rewards Program - this location uses Belly Rewards. If you aren't familiar, it's a loyalty program that a lot of smaller businesses use. I use my Belly Rewards at a lot of places I frequent and it pays off: I've gotten free scones, free coffee upgrades, free massage upgrades, and free sides.  ...  ... Now if you'll excuse me, I have a cheesesteak with sweet and spicy peppers, onions, and mushrooms sitting here calling my name.

REVIEW #17:  4 stars  (791 chars)
We go to Madison a couple times a year and I think we will probably make this a regular stop going forward.   Service has always been good - it's pretty speedy considering that each time we've gone there has only been one person working and it hasn't taken very long for things to come out.  The sandwiches are enormous and very tasty - the last time we were in, I accidentally ordered a cheese steak sandwich and it was absolutely delicious.  The sandwiches come in various sizes but they are all pretty enormous and very filling.  If you are unfamiliar with the area, it may be a little tricky to get to and on one occasion, while the parking lot is big, was completely full and we couldn't quite figure out why but we ended up finding a spot eventually - well worth it once you get to it!

REVIEW #18:  4 stars  (1286 chars)
When you work on the far west side and forget your lunch at home as frequently as I do... what? OK, I'll start over. When you work on the far west side and you're too lazy to pack a lunch, you get kind of tired of the Milio's across the street from the office. The Cousins down the road is fine, but there's one of those near home for the days when you forget to buy groceries for dinner (yeah, yeah... or you're just too damn lazy to make it).  ...  ... What's left, then, for your traditional sandwich lunch? Capriotti's, of course! Located in a clean, newish space on Junction Road, this place boasts a friendly staff and good selection of sandwich choices. My favorites are the Capastrami (haven't tried it? you haven't lived), the Bobbie (with the pulled turkey and dressing and cranberries, it's Thanksgiving every day sans a Detroit Lions loss) and the cheese steak (add the hots and sweets, or forget it).  ...  ... The service isn't as fast as, say, Subway, but that is offset by the fact that they don't serve sandwiches that taste like cardboard. It's fast enough -- I can drive over, order my sandwich, and get back to my desk without being out of the office for 30 minutes.  ...  ... 4 stars on the sandwich shop scale. If they had a punch card, I'd eat a lot of free subs.

REVIEW #19:  3 stars  (230 chars)
9/3/13 Capriotti's delivered subs to my place of work.  I found the shredded pork and coleslaw sub bland and dry, but the turkey, stuffing, and cranberry sub was tasty.  It was Thanksgiving dinner between two pieces of bread!  :-)

REVIEW #20:  2 stars  (2515 chars)
Going to go against the grain here and say that I'm not a huge fan of Capriotti's. ...  ... I work very close to this location, and like Christie L's coworkers, a lot of my cohorts may need to enter into a rehab for their Capriotti's addictions. But, I just don't get it. ...  ... They don't manage their traffic flow real well; there's a huge counter that you place your order at, which is then taken back to the kitchen to be prepared.  After placing your order, you're left to "mill about" as you wait for your food.   ...  ... There aren't enough tables for the normal lunch crowd, so you're hovering around, waiting for a table to open up.  It's worse if your order is "to go," because there's absolutely no queue to stand in. ...  ... The kitchen can be a bit pokey; today's order took more than 15 minutes to prepare.  We grabbed our order of 2 small subs, 1 sandwich, and 1 small hot sub and hit the office, $30 poorer.   ...  ... I've now had at least one item from each "category," and to be honest, they all taste about the same.  I totally appreciate the real nature of their meats, veggies, and breads, but I'm perplexed as to why they're all largely tasteless.  I suspect the bread is the culprit... no matter what I've ordered, the bread has been dry and bland. ...  ... I don't do oil/mustard/mayo/etc., so my sammies tend to be meat, veggies, bread... and the bread hogs my tastebuds.  Although today's turkey sandwich was exceptionally dry - the turkey was almost chalky, it was so dry.   ...  ... I roast/bake/grill a lot of chicken and turkey breasts at home, and I prepare them extra clean - no oil, no butter, etc., and mine are never as dry and tasteless as Capriotti's are. ...  ... Yes, I've tried "the Bobbie," and guess what - it was dry.  Combine dry turkey with dry stuffing and slap it on a dry roll, and see how you do.  I've tried the chicken cheesesteak - it was greasy and tasteless (but at least it wasn't "dry").  I've tried the Italian, and while it was salty, it was dry... you get the picture. ...  ... Call me what you will, but for about the same money, I'd rather hit Chipotle for a burrito bowl or a salad.   ...  ... Capriotti's = MEH ...  ... Service = 3.5 stars (friendly, nice) ... Food = 2.0 stars (bland/dry/tasteless, even the cheesesteak) ... Value = 1.75 stars ($30 for 4 items and 1 order of chips) ... MISC = 2.0 stars (poor crowd flow/logistics) ...  ... If you want a large sandwich/sub that's heavy on bread flavor and not much else, this may be your ticket.

Not happy, got there at open to get a meatball sub, I hope I got yesterday's marinara sauce, I hope they would not serve that crap.  It was horrible.  If that's you standard change it, I wasted my money and will not be back.

REVIEW #1:  4 stars  (462 chars)
Great place for gourmet subs. I love the capastrami, and anything with turkey. The daily roasted turkey's here definitely separate them from all the other sub shops. The only thing it's expensive ($9.50 for a 12" sub) but if you get lucky you can get a survey on your receipt for $3 off your next order. The service is getting better, but it can still be slow during peak times because the sandwiches by convention take longer to make than say at a jimmy john's.

REVIEW #2:  4 stars  (592 chars)
If you want a great sandwich in Madison, come to Capriott's, hands down. The Bobbie is basically thanksgiving on a hoagie, with awesome hand-pulled turkey, cranberry sauce and just the right amount of mayo. And the Capastrami is awesome if you're looking for something hot. Hot pastrami with russian dressing and cole slaw, perfect combination of ingredients. The bread is nothing to write home about, but very solid as well. The prices are higher than Quiznos/Subway etc., but you're paying for much higher quality ingredients. Gotta say, I miss living right down the street from this joint.

REVIEW #3:  2 stars  (1228 chars)
I've been here a few times and I enjoy the cheesesteak with onions and both sweet and hot peppers quite a bit. It's better than other sandwich shops downtown. Aside from having a sandwich that I like, this place really needs to get things together. ...  ... It's never easy to park. I always have to drive around the block in circles trying to find a street spot to park. ...  ... On one visit I got to counter in the evening as the only customer and watched two employees sitting in the back on their cell phones for over a minute before being greeted and served. ...  ... I stopped in at 9:30 on Friday night, a half hour before close, and as I walked in I was told that they had no sandwich bread. I suppose it's worth it to Capriotti's corporate to pay their employees and the utility company to keep the lights on just to turn away paying customers. The more likely scenario is that they don't pay a manager to maintain the business properly. ...  ... Any business that runs out of the single ingredient required for their signature menu items and doesn't give customers a voucher at the door to come back for a discounted or free sandwich on the next visit needs to re-evaluate why they are even in business to begin with.
