I like Simplicity Laser Hair Removal. I have the full body plan. I started going to them because of Groupon. I started at the Chandler location, but they moved three times and it pissed me off so I switched to Mesa, which is closer to my home anyways (Mesa wasn't open when I started and they won't let you switch locations if you are using Groupon). ...  ... The laser at the Mesa location is better than the Chandler location. At Mesa it emits a cold blast only when the laser goes off. At Chandler it is all the time and gives me goose bumps. ...  ... The staff is super friendly and pretty talkative. They seem to be interested in what you have to say.

My first few experiences with Simplicity were less than stellar, but they have made some internal changes lately and seem to be getting things back in line with where a company of their size should be as far as customer service and organization.  ...  ... I bought my first Simplicity package through Groupon (underarms) and had to wait over 2 months for my first appointment. I also had an experience where I showed up for my 8am appointment and no one was there... no staff at all. When I called the main number they said that the one girl that was scheduled to be there called in sick. Needless to say, I was pretty upset (I got myself out of bed at 7am just for that one appointment and didn't get a call... AND they weren't able to get me in for 2 weeks after that appointment that they cancelled on me). Also, was frustrated that the Chandler location switched locations THREE TIMES in less than a year.  ...  ... But, after talking to a manager, it seems that they oversold their Groupons and were not prepared for that many customers at once (duh) and they had some pretty big issues with the locations in Chandler that caused them to move.  ...  ... Anywho, lately, I've had no issues. The gals at the Chandler location have been very nice and friendly, making me feel comfortable every time I'm there.

REVIEW #3:  1 stars  (3173 chars)
Are you kidding me? ...  ... Fair warning: I am super super annoyed right now.... ...  ... I bought a Groupon for this place August 29, 2011 for some underarm hair removal (yes, I'm too lazy to shave my pits) because it was a good deal and close to my home.  When I called for my initial appointment, they did not have anything available until mid-February.  Really?  Fine - I booked. ...  ... Then they moved.  Now they are about ten miles from me.  Okay but annoying.  ...  ... The first session went well.  There was really no wait time or pain.  I was in and out quickly and booked my next appointment.   ...  ... At the next appointment, they were able to complete one side (one armpit).  Then the machine broke.  It just wouldn't start back up.  Instead of them squeezing me in for the three minute treatment in another room with the other machine, they told me to call and reschedule the appointment.  Again, annoying, but things happen. ...  ... The next appointment to get the other side done was within two weeks but I had to wait in the lobby for a while for my appointment.  Then there was confusion on the client being called back - there were two Katherine's and since I'd been waiting longer and the other Katherine didn't get up, I assumed it was me - of course it wasn't.  When I got back into the room, it turned out that it was the medical office that Simplicity shared an office whith that had called me back.  They brought me back to the waiting room and apologized for the confusion saying they weren't allowed to say last names because of privacy reasons.  What?  Never heard of that.  Whatever. ...  ... My next session is scheduled for May 12th.  Today I get an email that THEY'VE MOVED AGAIN!  Now they are nearly 20 miles from me.  WTH??!! ...  ... So I called, to make sure that I understood the email correctly, that they had moved again (of course no one had told me that they would be relocating during any of the sessions or phone calls).  They confirmed that yes, they did move today. ...  ... I very politely said to the girl (she seemed VERY young) that I found this a little annoying that they'd moved once again.  She explained that it would be so much better now since they were not sharing an office anymore and relying on others.  She did NOT apologize. I asked well who can you communicate that to, that I've had to be inconvenienced with the equipment not working and now them moving further and further away?  Is there someone that you can let know?  She told me she would put a note on my file.  I said well, that's fine but will anyone see it?  Then she said, well I'm not really sure what you want to get out of this.  WHAT?!  I said well, all I'm trying to do is lodge a complaint with someone who would care that I've had such an annoying experience but it doesn't appear that is going to happen right now, so thank you.  She told me to have a nice day.  LOL ...  ... I still have 4 more sessions to go through for my entire treatment.  I'm pretty bummed so far and can't really recommend this place.  I'm not even sure if the treatment has made a difference yet since I've only had two and supposedly it takes up to six.  :(

REVIEW #4:  1 stars  (587 chars)
Well, if there was a way to do "zero" stars, I would.  I had called when I initially bought my Groupon but was told that it would be about 2 months before I could get in so I decided to wait and see what my schedule was for the fall.  I just called back today to set up an appointment and lo and behold, the girl told me that my Groupon had already been used...back when I initially called but didn't schedule anything.  There is nothing they can do about it apparently and now I have to take it up with Groupon.  What a joke!  I should have read the reviews before I bought the Groupon.

REVIEW #1:  5 stars  (1181 chars)
I bought three groupons for simplicity because after the first groupon I bought for my underarms, I had AMAZING results. I am hispanic and my hair is dark and coarse. So usually if you're new to getting laser hair removal, you get the best results if you have very light skin, dark and coarse hair. However, even being tan I've had fantastic results!  ...  ... The great thing about Simplicity is their lasers treat all skin types and do not touch the skin, so you can have piece of mind that you won't pick up anything from someone else, or have improper cleaning. These lasers also blow a cool air while pulsing, which makes your session MUCH more comfortable. I've had several sessions for my brazilian, and although it still hurts like hell, the cold air makes it bearable without any type of numbing cream. They also have a killer deal every month. For example, I purchased a "full leg" membership for only $39/ month ( this is usually close to $100/month).  ...  ... All in all, everybody experiences different results and it really all comes down for if you're a good candidate  for laser hair removal. Research the lasers that are good for your skin type and go from there.

REVIEW #2:  5 stars  (320 chars)
This is fantastic place.  I bought a Groupon for laser treatment and truly love my experience.  The staff are very knowledgeable and want to make sure you are comfortable with the treatments.  I would recommend getting laser treatments here.  The prices are very reasonable and they have several locations in the valley.

REVIEW #3:  4 stars  (268 chars)
I have been a customer here for a while. You get good results on areas with thicker, coarse hair. Areas with finer hair take longer and may grow back. Don't take antibiotics for 7 days prior to your appointment. Avoid sun for a week before and after treatment as well!

REVIEW #4:  4 stars  (785 chars)
The new location is beautiful though it can be hard to find the first time and you have to call the 800 number for directions but they're helpful. I have purchased two of the groupon deals for underarm and brazillian and I'm loving it. I've finished the 8 treatments for underarm and 6 for brazillian so far and there's still hair growing but less of it and what does grow back is much finer so that's pretty cool.  ...  ... Ashley did my last set of treatments and has been awesome - I see her like once every 6 weeks and somehow she remembers me and what we talked about for the 15 minutes months earlier, she has to have a ridiculously awesome memory and is super friendly. Will probably have to get another groupon or membership to finish it off but wouldn't hesitate to come back.

REVIEW #5:  3 stars  (444 chars)
I'm just about to finish up my last of 8 visits for my bikini line and I have been less than impressed. The facility is nice and they are always very prompt, but I haven't noticed one bit of difference in hair growth. It's not finer, it's not sparser, I literally haven't noticed any difference except that I'm out some decent $. I know laser hair removal can vary a lot depending upon hair type, etc. but overall I've been pretty disappointed.

REVIEW #6:  3 stars  (818 chars)
Simplicity is the only laser company that I've ever used so I don't have much of a comparison. During my year and a half (or so) that I spent with the company I had several frustrations. I've had my appointments cancelled twice with less than 24 hrs notice...once they called me as I was sitting in the waiting room to tell me that the tech called in sick and they could reschedule me in just 3 weeks (WHAT?).  ...  ... Additionally, they moved locations 3 times which is annoying but each time they moved a bit closer to my house so that worked out ok for me personally.  ...  ... The techs were usually friendly and made what could have been an uncomfortable situation relatively pleasant. The newest office in Chandler is nice - much easier and less confusing now that they have their own office and a receptionist.

REVIEW #7:  3 stars  (625 chars)
Went in today for the first time of 3 appointments I will have.  Am getting my upper and lower leg hair removed.  The receptionist at the desk was doing a fine job getting me my papers but a bleach blonde gal come up and insulted her and took over.  I felt bad for the lady that was helping me and uncomfortable that she was so rude.  A young gal named Tatum did my procedure and was super great.  I saw she had a tip jar with only a $20 in it which reminded me to tip but I wanted to tip $10 and she didn't have change so I will leave $20 after my next visit.  What is a fair tip anyway?  We spent about 20 minutes together.

REVIEW #8:  2 stars  (1116 chars)
I would rank the Chandler location, and it's employees at 4 stars (-1 just for scheduling). The location is really nice, and everyone that I have dealt with there is very nice. I did see expected results - but please do your research before signing up so you don't have the wrong expectations. Scheduling can be tough. Try to schedule your appointments ahead of time and keep them, otherwise you may not get in for a few weeks. This particular location is wonderful! ...  ... I would rank the customer service 0 stars. I have NEVER had a good experience calling the 1-800 number. From scheduling errors, to billing issues, and finally canceling my membership. Every time, something bad. Since I can't rate the location itself and the customer service # separately, I will go halfway and give them 2 stars.  ...  ... The pricing is great! My advice: try a groupon first, if you like it, and can afford to pay for a package up front, that's the way to go. Too many issues with their monthly billing, and customer service - if they made improvements in policies and customer service it would be an overall better place.

REVIEW #9:  2 stars  (752 chars)
Where to start.  Perhaps I will just list pros and cons and let you decide. ...  ...  ... Pros: Cheap (buy on Groupon!!)  New facility is MUCH better than previous ones. ...  ... Cons:  1800 # is the only contact.  Different technician each time, which translates to different sizes being treated.  They are not interested in the LEAST to help you.  They want to make your treatments appt as difficult as possible.  Scheduling is a joke, don't expect to get in anytime soon (I schedule 2 appts in advance and work off that). ...  ... Bottom line.  You get what you pay for.  I would NEVER pay on some sort of "real" plan.  They are a joke to deal with.  BUT, with that being said, once you know how to work the system, and you CAN get in, it does work.

REVIEW #10:  1 stars  (276 chars)
Horrible customer service. I had never been to this location and I could not find it my first time. I was 7 min late and they said they couldn't treat me.... I have been trying to get an appointment for 4 months. I will not continue my membership when it is done not worth it!

REVIEW #11:  1 stars  (1699 chars)
I purchased a groupon for underarm hair removal and I was super excited to have this treatment done. Needless to say my results from the year and a few months treatment were not as advertised.  ...  ... I am a white female, my hair is not super coarse but is fairly dark. At my first consultation it was explained that I had ideal skin/hair for very minimal re-growth after completing the course of laser treatments. Now about a year or so after completion of laser treatments, I find myself having to shave like before. I did my research before getting this treatment done, and I went in knowing that results may vary. The disappointing part comes from paying a lot of money for treatments and being told that I was a candidate for "optimum results." I also expected not to have much hair growth after the visits as that was what I was advised would happen.  ...  ... Not the case!   ...  ... I would not recommend Simplicity for a couple reasons: giving unrealistic result expectations from jump street, constantly moving locations and not telling me they moved so I would show up at my appointment only to find they were no longer at that local and the laser technicians & front desk staff had very snooty attitudes. Oh, did I mention I was constantly being hard sold to upgrade and spend more money on additional areas to treat. I get trying to up-sale customers, I was in sales so I understand it's purpose. But if I say no once, or even twice...don't keep coming after me to spend more money. If I was satisfied with your services, I would have dropped more cash, I was not satisfied nor impressed......no means no! ...  ... I am just grateful that i did not pay full price for their services.

REVIEW #12:  1 stars  (924 chars)
I signed a two year whole body contract with Simplicity in 2010. As many have stated before me-the office moved several times during those two years. They were not able to schedule me in a timely manner and it is my understanding that laser hair removal only works if your hair is in the correct growth phase. Well that can't happen if they can't offer you a timely appointment. At one point towards the end of my contract I told the esthetician  that it felt like the laser was burning my lip and I actually teared up from the pain. She told me that that was impossible and that she was the professional and I should just let her do her job. Needless to say I spent 2400.00 and still have to shave. I recently called them and they told me that they could do touch ups at 99.00 each and that these touch ups are always necessary with any laser hair removal service. Very sorry I chose Simplicity and allowed them to dupe me.

REVIEW #13:  1 stars  (3627 chars)
I started using Simplicity for a Groupon, about a year ago, because I thought "Hey, why not, it's only $198, what could it hurt?" and things seemed to be going okay.  I also got it because their facility was close to my place in Mesa, but after one treatment, they had moved to South Chandler.  It's a 30 minute drive for me now, but as someone else said in another post, annoying yes, deal breaker, no. ...  ... After 5 treatments, it didn't seem to be doing that much for me, as I was still having to shave rather frequently, but I thought I would give it a longer go, and they had a special.  Shortly after signing up for this, I had to go to work in Philly for a month or so, and while there, I broke my right ankle - trimalleolar fracture (every bone in my right ankle was shattered).  The package I had was for full legs and I had a cast going up half my right leg and then after that I had a boot.  Also, I've been in a wheelchair for the better part of three months, so there was no way that I was going to be having laser hair removal any time soon. ...  ... I called up back in early May, shortly after my incident, and explained the situation and stated that I wanted to cancel my contract because it hadn't started yet and I broke my ankle, etc.  She said that they could cancel the contract for $99 but if I would get medical proof, they could cancel it for no charge.  In the mean time, they were going to put my account on hold and when I was able to, I would just call back and reschedule my appointments.  I was totally fine with this agreement. ...  ... Fast forward to now, when I was balancing my accounts and noticed that I've been being charged for the last three months!  I was appalled and immediately sought to do something about it.  I called them up on Tuesday (it's Thursday now and still no resolution) and she said she would have to speak to someone and call me back that day or the next.  I heard nothing back for the rest of Tuesday, and nothing at all on Wednesday.  Finally at 10:48a on Thursday, I get a call back stating that they cannot cancel the contract but what they could do is extend it.  I stated that I do not really care to do business with a company that cannot honor their word and that I was lied to.  I'm a pretty faithful and loyal customer, and my friend even recommended them to me, but this customer service has been horrid.  All I asked for was a refund of the final session from Groupon, plus a refund of the last three months, sans the $99 for the contract termination fee, just to save me the trouble of calling my doctor's office, getting the medical information I need, finding a fax machine, sending it to Simplicity, etc.  I just wanted to sever all ties.  Currently, I still have no resolution, and they would not let me speak directly to a supervisor.  I'm being told that they'll call me back.  As of the writing of this review, I have no resolution and I shall never recommend anyone to this service, and will be telling all my friends to never use their services.  I've already posted this in other social circles as well. ...  ... I finally received a call back about the situation on Tuesday, 30 July 2013 around 3pm and was apologized to for everything going so incredibly wrong and that she wished that corporate would have contacted her sooner to sort everything out, but by this time it was too late and she is in the process of returning the money owed to me and canceling the contract.  In the end, it was resolved, but not until a week and a half later of going back and forth.  If I do decide to ever resume my laser treatments, it will be elsewhere.

REVIEW #14:  1 stars  (2825 chars)
No!!  Don't do it!   ...  ... This is my second review on this particular merchant.  They were previously located at 1455 W. Chandler Blvd Ste B-11 inside of the Bellagio Clinic.  They promised that the move to their own facility would enable them to provide better service.  Not at all... ...  ... Apparently, if you are a male and have an accent, certain staff does not wish to be pleasant or provide even the most basic customer service, let alone treatment.  Let's just say my husband has had a truly horrible experience with this place.  To the point of being prejudicial, but that is his story to tell... ...  ... I've really tried to give this place a second chance after the last experience I had.  They swore up and down that that was not how they normally operate and that the move (another 10 miles out of my way, now totally 20 from my home) would only allow them to improve service as they would no longer be restriced by working in a physician's office. ...  ... Here is what I know: ...  ... It's impossible to get scheduled within a reasonable amount of time.  They are either under staffed, overbooked or both. ...  ... It's impossible to speak to someone who is not a child.  Seriously, they all are just out of high school.  They can't answer simple questions and they are all sitting around texting or looking at Facebook on their cell phones. ...  ... There is never any management on site.  How is this even permitted by their corporate office? ...  ... The website says "Our staff includes a certified esthetician, a registered nurse, a nurse practitioner, and a full time board certified medical doctor".  Not true.  No one is in the office except for the very young and unsupervised Laser Technicians.   ...  ... You cannot call them directly.  You must call the 800 number to ask questions about anything.  Even to ask driving directions when you cannot locate the new office and there is no signage to help you find the place.   ...  ... They have tip jars in the rooms.  Really?! Tip jars??!  Is this Starbucks?  This to me is completely tacky.  I have been in the service/hospitably/spa industry for over ten years and I have NEVER seen nor would even ever ALLOW a tip jar to be placed in a treatment room with a HUGE sign stating that tips are appreciated!  Of course they are - but don't make me uncomfortable and feel obligated to leave one - especially when the service is so very poor. ...  ... To submit a complaint, you must fill out a form online and wait for a call.  I did just that and received a call the next day from what I assume to be the location manager.  She left a voice mail.  I've been trying to call her back for three days.  It goes straight to voice mail.  I've left a voice mail but still no return call. ...  ... Over it and getting all of my money back from Groupon...

I agree with the previous reviews, I get pretty decent customer service, and the techs are nice.  I noticed a big difference between simplicity and the results I saw with them vs. Neos Med Spa.  I do see some improvement, but not nearly as much as Neos.  The groupon for simplicity was FAR less than Neos cost though.  I would consider another groupon to simplicity after seeing how my result end up after my final treatment, but mainly because of the low cost.

REVIEW #2:  1 stars  (1907 chars)
I am sad to have to write this review, since I love finding great businesses and deals to share with friends/family/etc. Unfortunately, I will NOT be recommending Simplicity Laser to anyone. In fact, I will be warning people NOT to waste their time and/or money there. I purchased a Groupon about a year ago for laser hair removal treatments. I have done laser hair removal before at Advanced Laser Clinics and got awesome results. I have several friends and family members who have also had laser hair removal done at ALC as well as other places. All of them have had great results as well. So, I am no stranger to laser hair removal and how it works. So, my groupon was for 8 treatments, with 4-6 weeks between each treatment. I spent the last year of my life driving 40 minutes to and from Simplicity Laser (in Glendale) every 4-6 weeks. I have been finished with my treatments now for about a month. I literally can't tell any difference in the amount of hair I have in the treated area. I will generously say that i have had MAYBE 10-20% reduction. This is absolutely NOT typical and unacceptable. I mentioned my concerns several times during my appointments and was blown off each time. I called to speak to a manager and was told that I should make a "client review" appointment to discuss my results and a possible resolution. I had my "client review" today and was basically blown off again, and told that they weren't going to do anything to help me unless I purchased more treatments. Basically, this company gets you in the door with, what seems like, a good deal...and then treats you at a low level on the machine...all the while trying to sell you more treatments. A good company will treat you aggressively with the machines, so that you see results. And then you'll come back to them because they work. I am very disappointed in this company and their business ethic, customer service, etc.

REVIEW #3:  1 stars  (845 chars)
I paid $1000 to get treated for a year and a half, which equals to about 14 sessions. I have one last treatment to do but I am so unsatisfied with the results that I know I have to go somewhere else once I am done with this place because I have the same exact hair growth I did before I started. I don't know what type of laser they use that gives such bad results. On top of that, they are pretty rude. A couple of times they gave me an evening appointment and the building door was closed once I got there. After calling them 3 times, the tech came down and opened the door. I was expecting for her to apologize but she acted like it was my fault. Anyways save yourself time and money and don't go to this place. They are expensive, don't know what they are doing,  they rush through every session and use broken lasers that doesn't even work!

REVIEW #4:  1 stars  (622 chars)
If I could give no stars, I would. First off, EVERY SINGLE appointment I have had, they cancel on me at the very last moment telling me their laser is broken. EVERY single time! This is terrible customer service. But my real issue is that I've had laser treatments at other spas and have great results immediately. So far after 4 treatments I've seen nothing. Couple that with the laser breaking every single time, I think their laser quality is awful and that I won't ever get the results I'm expecting. Don't waste your money with this company. Go find a reputable spa that is known for results, this is not one of them.

REVIEW #5:  1 stars  (190 chars)
It has only been a few months since I finished my treatment, but I already have the same growth as before I started.  It was a WASTE of time and money.  The treatments didn't change a thing.

When I bought my Groupon last year, I called to make an appointment in March and was told they weren't accepting Groupon appointments until April. The earliest I could be seen was late April. No bueno for bikini season. Nearly a year later, and my last Groupon visit is scheduled for this week and I'm going to cancel. I chose the "small" area for $99.  ...  ... I wish Groupon or Simplicity had explained that for a bikini area "small" meant one straight line down, and back up. That's it. One 1/4 inch "line" zapped on each side. The first four visits, the technician did the two lines and booked my next appointment. It wasn't until I expressed dissatisfaction that I wasn't noticing a difference that another, friendlier technician told me to expect two dozen visits for a larger package for my desired result. That visit the technician zapped further out from the single line. And she tried to upgrade me on a different package. The following visit, same thing, zapping in a slightly larger area, smooth sales pitch to buy a new package. While my hair in the single line is lighter, more sparse, I still have to shave daily during swim season.  ...  ... I've since done more research, I'm going with electrolysis with a company that doesn't offer discounts to group sales. Unlike laser and pulsed lights, electrolysis kills every follicle the electrologist treats.

Got a groupon deal here so I tried it out. I've only had to treatments so fa but it went well. I was very nervous about the whole laser thing. They use a cold laser and it really doen't hurt but rather feels like a really cold chill. Like I said it's only been two treatments so I haven't really noticed the results. Both times the girls were really nice, quick, and professional. The office is located in a plastic surgeon office.

REVIEW #2:  1 stars  (581 chars)
I got suckered into signing up for the whole body unlimited month to month.   The tech burned me so badly I blistered and was in so much PAin.  So I tried again and they told me the laser was on the lowest setting.  It again burned me.  I took pics and I could not get out of the contract, spoke many times to corp office in Utah and told them the situation.  They made me pay my contract in full each month even though I was only able to do two treatments. Rip off, I do not recommends this business to anyone and have pics and bank statements to prove it. Beware of this company.

REVIEW #3:  1 stars  (2074 chars)
OK, love the laser, the customer service has been the biggest disappointment I think I can remember or have experienced, ever.  ...  ... I arrive, sit for over 10 minutes after checking in and then I am told, I have to reschedule because I was late...??? The clock is 5 minutes fast, you have a sign in the lobby saying they only allow 5 minutes to be late (to be fair to the other clients)  or they reschedule, and then argue with you about what time I actually arrived.... Argue, seriously!   ...  ... Then I see two techs sitting in the back office, on their phones, clearly not servicing clients. It is now 20 minutes after I arrived and while trying to reschedule, a client comes in and leaves. So I ask, why if you have no clients when I got here, and you have none now do I have to reschedule. She tells me some BS that they have to be fair to the other clients..... what clients?? I was the only customer in the office! Then the next lady arrives late, she got caught in the same accident as I did, they immediately tell her she needs to reschedule, still, no new clients.  ...  ... I spent over 30 minutes after arriving, signing in, waiting to be told I have to reschedule then having to wait to reschedule ...  wouldn't it have been more customer service oriented to stop arguing and just perform the procedure. It literally takes 2-5 minutes for two procedures.... I spent more time on the office rescheduling than I have combined over all of the appointments I have previously attended. ...  ... But guess what, now I am late for my next appointment, at which I was not told to reschedule, but was accommodated, I was treated as a paying customer.... Oh, I get it now, Simplicity already has my money, they do not need to be polite or provide customer service, they only need to argue with me...   ...  ... Never wrote a review before, that was negative, this is a first and hopefully will be my last. I will be asking for a refund but I am sure I will be told No... the easiest answer they can give instead of providing customer service. Scottsdale, AZ office.

Bought on a Groupon for my husband without checking ratings first. It has only partially working after 4 visit, to rid the hair. They begin the treatment on a lower level and then work their way up. They don't use any gel (Cheap) and it hurts like hell and do not provide any cream afterwards. And there are spotty hair patches that look like corn rows! When we confronted the black haired woman, who likes to listen to country music, she got all defensive. Face it chica, you did a craaapppy aaaasss job!  ...  ... Better off with another place, check AZ spa Girls for reviews and deals, Spa 810 rocks! ...  ... Case in Point: Groupon has hit all time lows, Living Social is junk too.

I am sad to have to write this review, since I love finding great businesses ... and deals to share with friends/family/etc. Unfortunately, I will NOT be ... recommending Simplicity Laser to anyone. In fact, I will be warning people ... NOT to waste their time and/or money there. I purchased a Groupon about a ... year ago for laser hair removal treatments. I have done laser hair removal ... before at Advanced Laser Clinics and got awesome results. I have several ... friends and family members who have also had laser hair removal done at ALC ... as well as other places. All of them have had great results as well. So, I ... am no stranger to laser hair removal and how it works. So, my groupon was ... for 8 treatments, with 4-6 weeks between each treatment. I spent the last ... year of my life driving 40 minutes to and from Simplicity Laser (in ... Glendale) every 4-6 weeks. I have been finished with my treatments now for ... about a month. I literally can't tell any difference in the amount of hair I ... have in the treated area. I will generously say that i have had MAYBE 10-20% ... reduction. This is absolutely NOT typical and unacceptable. I mentioned my ... concerns several times during my appointments and was blown off each time. I ... called to speak to a manager and was told that I should make a "client ... review" appointment to discuss my results and a possible resolution. I had ... my "client review" today and was basically blown off again, and told that ... they weren't going to do anything to help me unless I purchased more ... treatments. Basically, this company gets you in the door with, what seems ... like, a good deal...and then treats you at a low level on the machine...all ... the while trying to sell you more treatments. A good company will treat you ... aggressively with the machines, so that you see results. And then you'll ... come back to them because they work. I am very disappointed in this company ... and their business ethic, customer service, etc.

I have been getting laser from Simplicity for almost a year now and I am very happy with my results. The customer service is great, I love the email appointment confirmations they send you - very useful and convenient. The Scottsdale salon is a nice new office. The staff is friendly. They have great deals. My hair is going away nicely. I'm very happy!

I've never been to a business that operates with such efficiency.   These girls are always on time.  I'm a punctual person and I appreciate it. ...  ... This office is fairly new.  It is located in a new medical office park/building.  So, the area in which it is located looks fabulous and is clean.  The office door is right up the stairs to the right.  It is not at all difficult to locate. ...  ... The ladies in the office are professional and they know how to get the job done.  I could not be happier with the services that I've received and I will go back and complete my treatments.  One of the better $99 I've ever spent.  I am SO happy with the results!   ...  ... NOTE:This is a note for women with darker skin.  This office does have YAG lasers.  If you are thinking about getting Laser hair removal and you have darker skin tones, then you want to use the YAG laser.  Google it.  It is the best laser for darker skin.  Even if you don't choose this location, I would ask if a different location has the YAG before accepting an appointment there. ...  ... I personally think that when I'm getting a cosmetic service such as this, the office should provide modern amenities that I don't get when I go to my GP, like WiFi so I can check my Yelp Messages with faster downloads.  :-)  Unfortunately, this office does not provide that service.  I wish they would.

I contacted Simplicity laser, by email via the website, about my concerns and have not been acknowledged. BTW I have had no (zero) fallout from my last treatment. I am so annoyed at this place!

REVIEW #4:  1 stars  (641 chars)
I feel like I have to constantly monitor my treatment, they constantly try to use the Yag laser instead of the Alexandrite. I suspect that they don't have enough lasers plus it will extend my treatments because Yag is far less aggressive. The treatment I had today was Yag and the girl lied to my face-I asked three times if she was using the Alex and she said yes or avoided answering. I worked in this industry, as a RN doing treatments, and I know it was a Yag.  ...  ... I will not be going back, once I complete this Groupon package. I am disappointed with their customer service as well. They are not friendly and talk down to clients.

I have received a message from the corporate office manager, Jeanette, related to my  email but have not actually spoken to her-I did call her back twice, so far. My last call was Monday Oct 28, 2013 prior to my scheduled laser hair removal (LHR) apt but she just stepped into a meeting.  ...  ... I went to my appointment. Staff escorted me to the YAG room. I refused treatment. Told them that they have lied to me and I would not have treatment with the YAG. I left and wrote the following email to the corporate office..... ...  ... I am incredibly unhappy with the services at the Scottsdale,AZ office!!!!!! I have exchanged messages with Jeanette at the corporate office in Utah but have not been successful in an actual conversation. My final attempt at an effective treatment was Monday October 28, 2013 at 2pm at the Pima Rd location. I left without getting LHR treatment and at this point, I would appreciate a refund for four of the six paid treatments. The staff is offensive and unfriendly and lie about the laser they use!!!! I am appalled!! I worked as a registered nurse in medical aesthetics for two years, I do have knowledge and the staff disregard clients opinions and expectations. Please contact me for discussion of a refund. Thank you, Carolyn Burr ...  ... I hope they make things right. I'll let you know

If the price sounds too good to be true, it is because it is.  I have gotten good results with laser hair removal elsewhere.  When I didn't get any results at simplicity, I complained and they wouldn't give me the time a day.

REVIEW #7:  1 stars  (366 chars)
If you want to feel a LOT of pain use their hair removal service.  When I visited this place it was my first time using laser and I was naive enough to believe that laser hair removal was a painful thing.  Shop around and you will see that there are other providers with much better equipment that is NOT painful at all. Do not use this provider. Avoid at all costs!

REVIEW #8:  1 stars  (136 chars)
Still, no response from Simplicity. I am going to write to them again today. I want an additional treatment to make up for the last one.
