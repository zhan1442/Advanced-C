0	5	0	0	0	their prices may be higher than some asian cleaners but their quality of service is excellent. it really shows they take care of their customers clothing. i have never had my shirts packed so nicely when i pick them up at other cleaners. and looking over their work i found no flaws. ...  ... you get what you pay for here. and i will continue to be their customer :)
0	1	0	0	0	I had a very bad experience with the store.  Very rude seamstress. She cost the company she works for money because my husband and I will never go there again.  If you are looking for a friendly family business, do not go to Boston cleaners on West Charleston they are expensive, rude and unfriendly.
0	5	0	0	0	I was on vacation and found this cleaners in the area. They were super friendly and the place is clean. The prices are a bit higher then other places, but they found some casino chips in my pants pocket and returned them to me when I picked up my clothes! VERY IMPRESSED!
2	4	0	0	1	Burgers, Fries and a milkshake. Life doesn't get any better. The burgers are really good and so are the fries. But what really sticks out are the milkshakes. The Oreo milkshake is my favorite and I cannot get enough. This is the place to go to satisfy that burger, fries and a milkshake craving after a hot summer day of chilling by the pool.
2	5	0	1	1	Everyone in my family was sad to see this place close down several years ago but we were all excited to see it open again on a recent trip.  Great fries, great garden burgers (most of us are vegetarian) and great milkshakes.  A recent trip to Chandler Mall included lunch at Ruby's followed by a trip later in the shopping spree to consume some milkshakes.  Not a bad way to spend the day (and 5,000 calories!).
2	4	1	2	1	I love me some diner food and this is a good place to find it.  4 stars for the diner category.  Our first visit here was for brunch.  I tried out the Carnitas Skillet.  It was good, but I discovered carnitas is not great in a scramble.  The potatoes were great.  My wife had Huevos Rancheros and was gracious enough to share with me...good stuff. ...  ... The kids had a burger & mac' n cheese.  Both were good.  The staff here was very friendly and helpful and every request for this or that was met with a "sure!". ...  ... Our waitress was very good and had this almost Amy Winehouse look going on.  I thought she was hitting on my wife as she kept referring to her as "sweetie" or "honey" or "babe" or...but by midway through the meal this had transferred to all of us.
3	3	0	0	0	3 1/2 STARS ...  ... This is Marriott's TIME-SHARE complex across from their luxury hotel. We traded a time-share for a week here in May. I must say, the place was packed - it appeared to be fully occupied. ...  ... Our room was small but just fine for us. The employees were all friendly and the grounds were kept in good shape. ...  ... We found this to be a good place to use as a base for a week's holiday while taking day-trips to the Grand Canyon, Sedona, Prescott, Scottsdale, the Phoenix Botanical Garden, and so on...
3	4	1	3	0	My friend got the time-share suite (2 bedrooms, living room, kitchen, and 2 balaconys).  SWEET!  We had a wonderful time enoying complex.  The grounds were well kept.   ...  ... The pool area was walking distance.  2 large pools (1 pool had a waterfall, volleyball, and basketball), 2 hot tub areas, 1 kiddie pool.   ...  ... Stayaction for the weekend!
3	5	0	3	0	I traded my lockout unit (Extra bedroom) from Desert Springs Marriott Villas in Palm Desert for a one bedroom, living room and dinning area and kitchen. The unit was on the third floor end unit which had a terrific view of the Wildfire Faldo golf course.  ...  ... Marriott Vacation Club is awesome. I've owned the two bedroom unit in Palm Desert location for 16 years and also a two bedroom week in Newport Beach Coast for eleven years. The program is nice BC it allows me to occupy, trade, rent, deposit outside of Marriott or trade my weeks for reward points or vacation points.  ...  ... Canyon Villas is located at the JW Marriott which is great due to you'll have all the amenities of the hotel pool, spa, hotel restaurants, and two 18 hole golf courses within minutes of your villa. If you choose to use the villa amenities  there are several pools, a fitness center, beach volleyball, and daily activities.  ...  ... I highly recommend ownership in Marriott vacation club, the program has enabled me to travel to Phuket & Bangkok Thailand, Hong Kong, Macau, Shanghai, Xian, & Beijing China, Bali & Singapore Indonesia, Ho Chi Men Vietnam, several islands in Hawaii, Paris France, Cancun, Puerta Vallarta Mexico, Boston, several cities in Florida, West Virgina, Manhattan, New Orleans, Hilton Head and Savannah. I know i'm missing some places but you get the drift.  ...  ... I've never been let down with Marriott Vacation Club locations that's why I try to stay within the Marriott family - with other timeshares you don't know what your getting. Another pointer is never buy outside the U.S. International Timeshares go under and your screwed. I had a co worker that had that happen in a resort in Mexico.
3	5	0	3	0	This is one of the nicest hotels I've ever been on. It was spacious and their bathroom alone was ginormous!!! I would definitely keep going back whenever I'm in town.
3	4	0	1	2	My roomie's father has this timeshare thingy and selected this place and invited us to fly out here. ...  ... Wow!  The Marriott Canyon Villas is one of the nicest places that I've stayed at.  We basically stayed at a huge suite with an adjoining room.  Big kitchen.  Large living room.  Furnished balconies.  Big bathroom.  Washer and dryer included.  You're bound to have a grand time here. ...  ... Except...the beds.  I found the bed to be a little too soft for my comfort.  After my second night there, I spent the rest of the week tossing and turning.  My roomie found better comfort on the couch.  I should have just slept on the floor. ...  ... Everything else was great!  The hot spa was heavenly.  The sauna was relaxing.  The gym is open 24 hours.  There were adequate games available to keep people, especially kids, busy.  There is a mini-convenience store where you can also rent DVDs.   ...  ... Canyon Villas couldn't have picked a better location than at Desert Ridge.  If you go out for a walk or a run, you can't miss this huge beautiful golf course.  In addition, you're bound to see wild quails running around.  Don't be surprised if you spot a jackrabbit here and there.  Plenty of nature sceneries here. ...  ... Friendly staff here.  Awesome place that just need to improve their beds.
3	2	2	4	1	Looking at the schedule of the resort activities upon arrival, we learned that Wednesday was a cowboy sing-along. No, I'm not shitting you. I love my family and we had a great time being with each other, but that really epitomized our opinion of this hokey old-person resort.  ...  ... If you have a timeshare somewhere like Vegas or the Poconos, this place might be worth your while to swap. For us (a family that owns our timeshare in Maui), it was quite a downward step.  ...  ... The room was smaller than our unit in Hawaii, which made little sense; it wasn't dirty, but also didn't feel as clean as other properties we've been to; a light was burned out in our room and the maintenance people neglected to fix it; and the workout room smelled like formaldehyde.  ...  ... The Marriott hotel across the way, however, is ridiculously luxurious. So if you're not bound to renting through the timeshare, you should stay over there instead. If you are bound to the timeshare, you can still use their pools, which is well worth it.
3	4	0	0	0	friendly staff, looks clean, great room amenities. their gym is right in front of the lobby with windows for all to see you sweat. no cardio machines. small snack shop w/ decent prices. bring your own spices for their kitchen.  look for luggage cart to move your things to and from car. free parking and wifi is a plus!
3	4	0	1	0	everything your family needs is on this property. space, cleanliness, modern kitchen, 2 pools, 1 kiddie pool, golf, fitness room, satellite TV, free parking, free wifi, grills on property to BBQ and rabbits for your kids to chase.  ...  ... there is a strip mall not too far from property which will cater to all you needs. its about 35min drive from phoenix airport.  nothing real scenic to go to in scottsdale so enjoy the property as much as you can. ...  ... prices are up there for rental and if you purchase things at their thrift store, expect it to be pricey too. employees and customer service was good! ...  ... we had a great time and cant wait to go back next year!
3	5	0	0	0	You will love Canyon Villas.  Address on Yelp is wrong, & I submitted a correction today.  7/9/2011.  We just returned from our 3rd stay at Canyon Villas, which are located at 5220 Marriott Drive, Phoenix,AZ. There are several buildings with studios, 1, & 2 bedroom/2 bath Villas (like condos).  They are sold as timeshare but can also be rented by anyone & traded into by other owners.  Numerous pools, spas, recreation & the nearby Desert Ridge Shopping Center offer much to do.  The villas & resort landscaping are really beautiful.  2 bedrooms sleep up to 8 people.  1 bedroom 4, & studio 4, but studios are better for 2 people max.  Villas have a full kitchen/dining room with dishwasher, washer/dryer, & all have patio or balcony with tables/chairs.  Resort has gas BBQ's scattered around that you can use.  Most of the time you can use pools at JW also, & Marriott has a free shuttle bus that takes you over there & back & also goes to Desert Ridge shopping center which has an Albertson's Market for your food supplies.  IF YOU PLAY GOLF, THERE ARE 2 SEPARATE COURSES NEXT TO THE RESORT, WILDFIRE IS ONE & I FORGOT THE NAME OF THE OTHER.  Take the Marriott timeshare tour, they are not high pressure & you can get $100.00 in Marriott dining dollars, or Marriott Rewards points.  Most people buy with Marriott as they are the premier timeshare company & owners love the resorts.  They now sell MVC points & you have no home resort, instead of timeshare weeks. It gives you freedom of reserving your time at any of the resorts.   Lots of wildlife live in the resort, owls, quail, rabbits and more.  You will love it!   Go to www.Marriott.com for more information.  No, I don't work for Marriott, but we are loyal and love the Marriott level of service and quality.
3	5	0	2	0	First off, ignore the review from Jen S. 1/19/2011, as it doesn't fall in with other reviewers & we have stayed here 3 summers for the week each time. Canyon Villas is beautiful inside & out & very clean.  If you ever have a problem call to report it & they will fix it quickly.  Hispanic maids at hotels never seem to report stuff like clogged drains or leaky faucets, etc.(in my experience).  Marriott service is amazing. Yes, they do have a cowboy singer who is at the firepit for about an hour so, who plays a guitar, but you don't have to sign along, & it is not a detriment.  This resort is not for old people, or hokey in the least.  It is beautiful with multiple pools on site (as well as those you can use at the adjacent Marriott JW Hotel).  The rooms at the hotel are smaller & no kitchen/washer dryer, etc.  If you like to cook your own meals, like having a balcony with table/chairs, dishwasher, & all amenities, incl. granite counters throughout, then the Villas are for you.  They can be rented by the night using Marriott reservations number or www.marriott.com.  Select Marriott Vacation Club for the search by hotel type & enter Phoenix.  There are now DVD players in every room, the "studio" (lockoff unit), the 1 bedroom master & the living room.  These 3 components equal a 2 bedroom, 2 bath unit.  You can rent 2 bedroom as stated, or just the studio with mini kitchen (small fridge, microwave), living room, sleeper sofa & king bed, full bathroom.  The 1 bedroom is the master unit with separate bedroom, bathroom with large shower, sink & toilet, plus a large soaking tub & 2nd sink.  Living room also has a dining table that sits 6 people with included chairs.  Marriott is upgrading sleeper sofas in all units when they come up for renovations to a new type that was tested at Marriott Villas Mountainside Park City Utah.  They are made by American Leather & are memory foam mattresses that fold out & are much, much better than the existing standard metal frame & lumpy old mattresses.   No telling when all locations will have them.   There is a special kids pool area at the north end of the Villas resort.  It has sprayers in the concrete, etc.  There is also a separate playground area between some of the buildings at the north end.  Each building is 3 stories high & each building has an elevator.  Generally these units are pretty quiet in my experience.  I have found the Canyon Villas to have a very good maid staff & they are very clean.  We usually trade our week for a week each year at Canyon Villas because we love it.  I love the desert & the landscaping & wildlife at Canyon Villas is just beautiful.  There is a free shuttle to the JW each hour & they go to Desert Ridge Shopping Center every 2 hours on the even hour.  Desert Ridge has BJ's Brewpub, Barnes & Noble, Dave & Busters entertainment,a large movie theatre, Kohls, & numerous other large restaurants & shopping.  You also get your groceries to stock the villa there at Albertsons (a great market).    We always can't wait to go back every year.   There is lots to do if you want to venture out, like the Phoenix Art Museum, Bot. Gardens, Zoo, Arizona Rock & Mineral Museum, visit the State Capital building, etc.  There is Wildfire Golf Course on one side of the property & another amazing Golf course on the other side.   Oh, the beds are the same as in the JW, firm, but have a pillow topper on them.  Super comfortable always!  Also, as the units are updated, they are going to have all stainless steel appliances.   If you do the highly recommended Marriott tour, you will see the updated unit they use for showing.  Marriott is a great company & timeshare tours are not high pressure.  It is a great product & well worth buying into.  They no longer sell weeks, just points & you no longer are tied to a home resort.  You can use your points annually for where ever you want to stay.  You buy a point value & still pay maint. fees based on the point value you buy.
3	5	0	1	0	We just got back from a weekend at the Villas and everything was fantastic. Great service, beautiful rooms (we had two two-bedroom condos), beautiful grounds. The beds were extremely comfortable and the kitchen was well-stocked for cooking.  We also used the gas grills to BBQ.   ...  ... We were really impressed with the staff both at the Villas and at the main resort (Marriott Desert Ridge) across the street. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful, even in the 105 summer temperatures. For pool time we preferred the Marriott/hotel side of the resort (the Villas office will provide you with a wristband to get pool access there).   The main hotel has two pools and a lazy river.   There are two pools at the Villas but the area is smaller and it feels more crowded.  The hotel also has a few restaurants, including a Roy's with patio seating and happy hour from 4 to 6pm.  Although we spent a lot of time on the hotel side of this resort, I always prefer the condos for kicking back, relaxing and for eating in when we want to.  ...  ... We'll definitely go back.
3	5	0	1	0	Back after one year but instead I traded my efficiency unit for a two bedroom - scored! ... The staff filled my request and gave me a high floor and golf course view. ...  ... The two bedroom was spacious and I really enjoyed the extra bedroom and bathroom. HD Direct TV was included and wireless internet is also complimentary. Staying here also gave access to the JW Marriott fitness center and pool and I utilized the Revive Spa with a Swedish massage. The Canyon villas offers shuttle service to the JW Marriott every half hour or you can take a 10 minute walk over which you can dine at 4 different restaurants and a Starbucks for your caffeine fix. ...  ... For those of you who don't know me I enjoy golfing and the Phoenix area has 119 public golf courses. I can visit the area and play different courses at various price ranges. The Marriott resort has two 18 hole golf courses one designed by Arnold Palmer and the other by Nick Faldo and both are upscale and in great condition. ...  ... So if your into spa, golf, dinning or all of the above check out Marriott Canyon Villas.
3	4	0	0	0	After spending endless time looking at condos on VRBO and other properties, we settled on the Canyon Villas, and were really, really happy with the decision.  ... In looking at traveling with kids, and with family in the area that we wanted to spend time with, we thought it was critical to have a full kitchen and ample space for us to spread out.  The Canyon Villas have all of this, and at a very high level.  ... We chose a ground floor 1-bedroom unit that backed onto the courtyard, which includes 2 shuffleboard courts, numerous gas fire pits, and three spotless grills.  It was ideal for family, and we used the grills nightly, which ended up being a great place to meet the other owners/renters. ...   ... The staff was superb, and the property was spotless.  ...  ... You do have access to the JW Marriott across the street, either via an on-the-half-hour shuttle or by walking.  In our case, the shuttle driver was under-utilized, and was basically on call, which was spectacular.  The JW is a gorgeous property, and the pool/lazy-river is top notch.  They have super-pricey dining options if you are leaning that way.   ...  ... Not having to eat out for every meal made fora very relaxing time, and not having to really venture off of the property for entertainment was even better.  The pools at the villas themselves are more than adequate for just about everybody - they just lack the lazy river - but have food & drink service, fountains, air hockey, etc. ...  ... It isn't cheap, but they have military and AAA discounts (we used AAA and saved a few bucks).  It really balances out if you do your cooking in the unit or on the grills - there is a very complete Albertsons less than 5 minutes away, along with a massive strip mall with any number of awful chain restaurants that you might want to utilize.   ...  ... For golfers - $199 seems absurd for a resort course, so I didn't play Wildfire.  Shop golfnow.com - there are deals everywhere in Phoenix on good courses - I found Legend Trail (~15 minutes North) for half that amount.   ...  ... Highly recommended.
3	4	0	1	0	This is a great family resort if you need a villa with a kitchen, washer/dryer and space. We have stayed at Marriott Vacation Clubs all over the U.S. and we really love it here. It's not too big but is in a perfect location for us. You can use the pool at the JW Marriott across the way, but my kids loved the pool here and it's easier to use. The pool was heated to a perfect temperature!  Across the way is the Desert Ridge Marketplace with an Albertson's, 24 hour CVS, Einstein bagels, many other fun restaurants, AMC movies, big box shopping like Marshall's, Ross, etc. It's very convenient for shopping and dining as well as getting to the 101 highway for all of the fun places to go nearby.  ...  ... I also found a great nail place across from Desert Ridge called "All About Nails". Very nice and very clean - plus reasonably priced. ...  ... We will return when we need a Scottsdale base for vacation. Our only complaint was check in was 2.5 hours late (6:30 PM instead of 4:00 PM), and the lack of pool towels on 2 days. Otherwise a well-run vacation club.
3	5	1	1	1	This place is awesome.  The place is beautiful and immaculate.  The golf course in front is stunning and I hope to play here in April.  There is a huge shopping mall with a supermarket, movie place and shopping so we made dinner in our condo tonight.  There is a lighted lounge area outside my room with BBQ grilles and shuffleboard courts.  The bathtub is huge and my wife loved taking a long bubble bath.
3	5	0	0	0	Great views, great customer service.
3	3	0	0	0	The rooms are absolutely first class, but I would not consider staying here again.  A few hours across the street at the JW Marriott proved most relaxing.  Unfortunately, it is a bit of a hassle to get over there.  There is nothing really in walking distance, and you need to drive a good distance to find a decent place to eat.
3	4	1	3	2	You can bet it will be a nice resort if it carries the Marriott name.  ...  ... They are consistent, even though some are still nicer than others.  Canyon Villas is located in upper Phoenix where the air is a bit cleaner, the view a bit nicer, open spaces and grand desert views, but still conveniently close to amenities. Accessible to the freeway and lots of shopping, it is living the good life. Well.....maybe not when it is 122 degrees outside, or a torrential monsoonal rain that can float your car away, or even a nasty dust storm.  Yes, it can have it's occasional down sides. ...  ... There are plenty of directions to go to find good food, entertainment, educational attractions, culture. I do lots of Yelp research and Grouponing for about a week or two before I come here, just to catch up on what's to do and see around here.   ...  ... The villas are beautiful and comfortable, good beds too. And then you have gorgeous desert landscaping, beautiful pools, patios, golf courses, a spa, kids' play areas, and fun scheduled activities (how about duct tape wallet making for one) if you would rather not go out in your car. Add to that the neighboring JW Marriott, with all its finery, with shuttle service every half hour to and from the resort. If you stay at this resort, all those things are part of the package. ...  ... And it is a convenient ~5 1/2 hour trip from Los Angeles area. ...  ... Mr. B and I like it here.
3	5	0	0	0	Bought here 8 years ago with absolutely no regrets.  The villas are wonderfully appointed and the atmosphere is great.  The staff goes above and beyond to come up with activities at the Villas.  Access to the main resort makes it equally appealing.  Also a short distance from lots of great dining and shopping.
3	5	0	0	0	I'm an owner and I am critical, but I couldn't be more impressed with the Canyon Villas.  The Staff - remembered my name and building.   ... The shuttle driver - remember my building and information ... The JW Marriott - was available ever 30 minutes via shuttle ... The Pool staff at JW Marriott - was friendly and explained what/how to enjoy the facilities ... The Marketing Staff - was not pushy and made me want to come back.  ... The tour guides - informative and fun ... The Cowboy Singer - had a great voice and did a wonderful Rawhide set ... The only thing I would suggest is that on Monday morning, get mics for the presenters or tell the grounds keepers to lay off the blowers and keep quiet for the one hour so we can hear what is available during the week.   ... I can't wait to come back.  I stayed in a lock off (no kitchen) but bbq'd every night.  Staff brought me a blender (not normally in the lock off) and made my stay wonderful.
3	5	0	0	0	Omg Tyson was the most helpful person I've ever met in the whole world. He made my whole expirence amazing! His awesome attitude was just a step above and beyond the call of duty. He should be the CEO of this place. Or at least a $2.83 raise!!!! Worth every penny of my time and money!!!!!!!!! ...  ...  ... Heart ya Ty!!!!!
4	4	0	0	0	Always packed which is a good sign! Very good food
4	3	3	2	2	Another strip mall joint, this place has pretty good pizza, but their entree items are better. Have had some good lasagna there, and eggplant Parmesan. I just don't like the atmosphere... I feel like I'm dining in a storefront ... Oops, I am!
4	4	1	1	1	I love Nicks!  Casual, consistent, well priced.  Great Osso Bucco, homemade pastas, love the seafood ravioli.  Several locations in the valley but we like the Frank Lloyd Wright one.  Sometimes the service is just ok but lately, seems to have improved.   ... Nothing fancy, just good food at a reasonable price.
4	5	0	0	0	I love this place!they have amazing chicken parm and I love the bread they served with olive oil and vinegar. Not to pricey but a good restaurant. I come here often with my family. Love the small family restaurant. You have to try this place!
4	5	0	0	0	Consistently good Italian food. Reasonably priced wine.  Love the antipasto misto.
4	5	0	0	0	Nick's is the mom and pop of AZ Italian restraunt must! The food is always consitently great! I highly recommend the Chicken Piccata. :) It is a very casual place as far as decore but the food is what does it for me.  I would have to agree with Ronald's review below. (The two chair in the middle... worth waiting for a better table)
4	3	4	5	3	I've been to Nick's a couple of times. The place is always mobbed by couples, groups and families. I don't get it, but I guess I'm in the minority on this one. ...  ... The bread is outstanding, the service is ok, but nothing to write home about. The Chicken Parmasean is so so. I only finished one of the two pieces of chicken because it was so meh. And the Linguini with Clams was unspectacular as well.
4	2	1	2	1	The prices are about 2 bucks more than their website.  Their sauce had a lot of sugar, not unlike ChefBoyArDee. The bread seemed like it included cornmeal, not tasty.  The service was just okay.
4	3	0	2	0	A favorite of my wife's. It is not a bad place but nothing exciting it is ok. So when my wife wants to go I usually take her. You know a happy wife makes for a happy me
4	4	0	0	0	Nice local Italian spot. Nice daily specials. Everything is fresh and very tasty with a nice presentation. I usually stick with the chicken parmesan. The one area they need help is with their bread.
4	1	6	7	2	How the hell you gonna trust a place to be authentic when they don't even know the difference between "parmesan" and "parmagiana," so they just combine them into a made up word. (WHAT THE HELL IS PARMASANA?) ...  ... "Parmagiana" is a style of cooking. "Parmesan" is the cheese you sprinkle on your spaghetti. ...  ... God! People can be so stupid.
4	5	0	0	0	LOVE! I love this place the greek salad is so addicting I could eat it everyday.  I always get the spaghetti with tomato sauce its pretty basic but the sauce it very sweet and delish!  It is a neighborhood place where you go in and you will know someone! Overall Excellent!
4	3	3	3	0	For an appropriate metaphor to Nick's restaurant, one need only look to the chicken section of their menu. ...  ... Piccata? Yes, quite. ...  ... Marsala? Ahh, of course, a staple. ...  ... Parmesana? Why certai-- wait. What? What the fuck is Parmesana? I get what Parmesan (Parmigiano) is: it's a dry, hard granular cheese. I'm also familiar with Parmigiana (which means "from Parma," Northern Italy): it's usually used to denote a particular breaded meat/eggplant dish that is bathed in sauce and cheese. Parmesana, on the other hand, isn't a word. One could write it off as a simple spelling error, but they repeat that exact mode in the following veal section. ...  ... So, there it is. Nick's is essentially a generic place that doesn't quite know its identity, and it does it extremely well without anyone ever noticing. ...  ... Nick's is a restaurant for people that are afraid of change; afraid of diversity; afraid of trying something new. While I can't say there's anything wrong with ordering Chicken Parmesan or Spaghetti and Meatballs every time you go out to dinner, it's not for me. After all, Nick's would be ridiculed amongst the pretentious diners of NYC, and I feel similarly. Every time my parents take me there (it is my father's favorite restaurant, which is very telling of his tastes in food) I can't find anything on the menu that sounds interesting enough to pop off the page. When I eat the food, I can't find anything about it that is exceptional enough to remain in my memory. ...  ... But, it is perfectly palatable, freakishly fresh food. I can't help but play devil's advocate and offer the argument that this is a great restaurant for people who like generic American-Italian food and are tired of (or too good for) Olive Garden. You know who you are. Just don't expect any breadsticks at Nick's.
4	5	0	0	0	Best Italian food in north Scottsdale for the money.  If you know of another one, let me know.  Their antipasto misto is the best I've had in AZ. Linguini with clams is to die for :) Very friendly service.  I'll never go back to Macaroni Grill!

4	4	0	1	0	Nick's Italian Restaurant (13910 N. Frank Lloyd Wright Blvd, Scottsdale, AZ) aims to please with a menu diverse in selection. Tinted windows, location inside a small strip mall on N. Frank Lloyd Wright makes for an unassuming establishment.  Upon entering, you are welcomed into a simple environment with a menu where one can find everything from traditional Italian pasta dishes to dishes with veal or seafood.  ...  ... Their traditional garden salad is a generous portion of lettuce, a sprinkle of tomato, and cucumbers served with your choice of ranch, blue cheese or house vinaigrette dressing ($3.95).   You receive a large portion of salad for this unbeatable price.  The house vinaigrette in particular, is light and coats every inch of the salad with taste. ...  ... For the main course, the "chicken parmesana" ($14.95) as spelled on their menu, takes a different twist.  Instead of a coated breaded chicken breast, theirs is simply a grilled chicken breast covered with a thick covering of mozzarella and mild marinara sauce.  Along with this dish, a serving of spaghetti with marinara sauce give the pasta compliment to this dish.  There is no lack of mozzarella cheese on this dish; every bite brings a delicious taste to any cheese lover.  ...  ... For dessert, their homemade chocolate chip cannoli ($5.95) is not to be missed.  A savory pastry shell is filled with traditional cannoli style cream, topped with many chocolate chips.  It is a most filling dessert; their cannoli can easily be split between two individuals. ...  ... With a simple atmosphere, Nick's simply focuses on what is most important - the food.  With a menu with many selections to choose from and delectable dishes, you can find a hearty Italian specialty easily at Nick's Italian Restaurant.
4	4	0	0	0	Yes, I am a fan of Nick's Italian Resto on FLW in North Scottsdale.  They have a great selection of salads here, works well if you are on a low carb or non processed food diet.  My favorite is the Di Mare salad which I modify to my liking, no shrimp and choice of oil and vinegar dressing.  Vegetarian?  They have caprese salad and pasta choices.  Lunch specials are available too for under $10.00.  The food here is tasty and delicious.  The only drawback to this place is the ambiance and the service.  They have black checked tablecloths, some Italian food decor, looks ordinary.  The service is hit and miss.  Take out is always a good choice.  If you however want good food and great salads, then Nick's is the place...  Buona appetito

I typically get penne with red sauce and sausage. This was the first time I ran out of pasta prior to running out of sausage! That's what I call loading it up with the good stuff! Also had a house salad which was an extra $4 or so (bummer that not included). A variety of different breads to warm you up. Save room for the tiramisu! Even if no room left, make some. Made fresh in house daily and probably some of the best ever.  ...  ... I'm a value guy. If soup or salad was included with the dinner, would have received 5 stars. Not knocking it in any way because it didn't. I'll be going back and see myself becoming a regular.  It was obvious that everyone there was a local!
4	4	0	1	0	tiramisu!!  luckily i ordered a salad and caprase salad so i didn't feel so guity having dessert.  it was very busy when we got there so it must be a fav in the area.  the service was good.  would go back.
4	4	0	0	0	I went here with my mother a couple of weeks ago off from a 'Groupon Now' offer. We shared the chicken picatta. The portion was large and the dish was flavorful. We each added on a side salad - it  was a typical salad for a restaurant, mixed greens with one slice of tomato; per usual, disappointing. However, I got the greek dressing and really liked it.  ... I felt the price was reasonable, but enjoyed it more with the groupon offer. They had a long list of specials that looked good and there were several menu items I would like try. I will check them out again sometime.
4	2	2	3	2	I had been wanting to try this place for awhile and a Groupon brought us in on a busy weekend night.  The place was packed to the gills, the several outdoor "patio" tables also full.  We were told 10 minutes wait.  20 minutes later we were still standing (no available chairs to wait in) against the wall.  (If the Groupon wasn't expiring, we would have left.)  Servers were desparately trying to navigate the tables and the crowded entrance to serve the patio area.  I admired the fact that most still continued to smile in the face of such a crowd.  Finally we were seated in a high traffic area, our chairs were continually bumped with each passing waiter or guest.  This was not fun or relaxing. ...  ... About the food.  Definitely not worth the wait.  We both had salads (because the pasta dishes do not come with any sides).  The wedge salad was covered with bleu cheese dressing, w/ sliced tomatoes and onions on the side.  House salad had a very nice balsamic dressing but the salad was 1 kind of lettuce & a couple cuke & tomato slices - we were not impressed, esp. for the price.  Penne Alla Campagna sounded good w/ spinach, sun-dried tomatoes, mushrooms & chicken - but it was somewhat bland, chicken was tough.  Lasagna didn't fare much better on our table.   ...  ... I wonder if the experience might have been different on a less busy night.  If they are always this busy, then I guess they won't miss our business.  With all the many choices in Italian, we won't be returning to Nick's.
4	5	2	3	1	LOVE NICKS! I have been coming here for many years... and the food has always been really good... at really reasonable prices. ...  ... I tend to stick with the pasta dishes... as all the pasta is fresh and homemade. My favorite dish on the menu it the fresh pasta, homemade sausage, peppers and onions, in a marinara sauce... amazing! I have also had the chicken marsala... also very good.  ...  ... The tiramisu dessert is amazing... make sure you save room. Also they sever Illy coffee which is wonderful. Great way to cap of the meal.  ...  ... My one word of warning is: Do Not overdo it on the bread before your meals arrives on the table!  ...  ... A true testament to this place is that everytime I come in it is always BUSY! This is true on a Tuesday night as it is on Saturday.
4	3	0	0	0	Pretty decent place. The kids ad pizza and liked it. I had veal parm and it was pretty good. My wife had a seafood pasta special with shrimp and she said it was tasteless all together. The prices seem to be reasonable in regards tithe pizza, but the veal and special were a little expensive for the quantity of veal I got and for the flavorless shrimp pasta combo. The atmosphere is nothing to speak of, almost cafeteria feeling with little or no decor at all. I would go back to try it again I think, but my wife would need more convincing. Overall, not a bad place, but fits in there with your average Scottsdale meal.
4	2	1	1	1	This place gets a big "EH" when it comea to food and service. The bread is clearly NOT fresh. It is cold to room temp at best and the texture gives away the fact it is not far from stale. I ordered the eggplant parm. The breading was too heavy, the sauce bland. Nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food. My side of steames veggies....cold. I am sure they sat for a long time before my eggplant was plated. My husbands mushroom ravioli in pink sauce was alright, but again the raviolis were clearly not housemade. The food took almost an hour to come out. The prices here are too high for what you get but other than that...I would not return or recommend. The place was busy though, so people must love subpar italian food.
4	3	1	2	0	For a local place, not too far from home, Nicks Italian works. I love their salads, especially for lunch. Pizza deal is great too. I have to be honest though, the past few times we called for "to go" orders, they never say THANK YOU and or a GOODBYE just the phone hanging up on us. I mean, come on! We're spending OUR money at your business and you can't even treat us with some gratitude when we place an order to go, especially when there are other restaurants competing for business??? ...  ... O.k., there is my rant. ...  ... I'll come back for lunch but I am saying goodbye to "orders to go" only because you all are not very pleasant on the phone. ...  ... I really do hope a manager reads this and fixes this problem, STAT.
4	4	0	0	0	I didn't actually go to Nick's, he instead came to me. I used Nick's for a company catering event today, and ordered 3 things: the meat lasagna, the chicken risotto, and the pasta bolognese. All 3 of them were delicious. The meat lasagna went so fast, we ran out of that before we even got into the second pan of risotto or pasta bolognese! It was meaty and hearty and everything a lasagna should be. We also got the spinach salad that was supposed to have cucumbers, tomatoes and bacon on it, but someone in the kitchen was a bit stingy with the cucumbers, tomatoes and bacon. They also brought sliced french bread that I used to sop up my meat sauce and it was the epitome of comfort food. Overall I really enjoyed the food, and would definitely go there on my own.
4	4	1	0	0	Nothing fancy here -- good-sized standard Italian dinners at reasonable prices in a family atmosphere. They have a handful of basic sauces that they put on a wide variety of dishes, ranging from fish to chicken to meat, as well as their homemade pasta. ...  ... A standout is the grilled vegetable salad. Sounds pretty ordinary on its face, but they do a great job with a healthy mix of carrots, zucchini and peppers.  ...  ... The eggplant parm was solid -- several slices of eggplant smothered in mozzarella. Another diner at our table had the housemade sausages (sweet) with homemade fettucine, which also got good reviews.  ...  ... The wine list is short (with a shortage of Italian wines with the except of three Chianti's) but well priced. ...  ... Our waitress said she'd been there with Nicks for 15 years, so she knew the menu inside out and winked when we ordered things she hinted were good. Gotta like that.
4	5	1	0	0	Great food Italian food. All homemade. Owner seems to be on location everyday
4	4	0	3	0	Nick's has great lunch specials! I ordered the Chicken Piccata & got enough of a serving for 2 meals at a fabulously affordable price. Service was awesome, it was also very quiet and not too busy. Don't judge a book by its cover, this place definitely has a "hole in the wall" appearance from the front, but it's gourmet in the back guys!
4	5	1	0	0	Great food! Great service.
4	5	4	4	4	I judge italian food by "Is it worth me making it myself because I can do it much better or is this good enough that I don't need to do the work."  I was raised making italian food and even make pasta from scratch on occasion. I tried Nick's because I got a groupon and I love trying new restaurants this way. About Nick's...I can't even make italian food this good!  ...  ... Everything about the food here exceeded my expectations. The appetizer antipasto combo was an amazing combination of italian meets, cheese, and bruschetta. Each item was fresh and delicious. For the main courses we had the gnocci with meat sauce and baked zitti with sausage. Both were perfect. Great sauce, fresh homemade gnocci and pasta, fabulous!!! For dessert we brought home two cannoli's because we were stuffed. Well that night we got to relive the whole expereince! The canollis are fantastic. Fresh, tasty...I really can't say enough about how good the food was.  ...  ... The atmosphere is great, restaurant is nice and clean, service great...I never have to cook again!!! This is absolutely my new favorite restaurant and probably the only italian restaurant I would recommend to people as being as good as mine! Conceited...I know :)
4	5	3	2	2	Fresh homemade pasta! You can really taste a difference in their sauce and noodles. I was a little concerned going in because of the looks outside, It is in a strip mall and I didn't expect much. Inside was very nice however. The service staff was very friendly and the food was great. The appetizer antipasta platter was the highlight. Fresh meats, peppers, and bruchetta. The canolli's were truly the best I have ever had and they were huge! I think this is now my favorite italian restaurant. The pizza's looked really good and I will be back to try them. My daughter remarked that the capuccino that she had was excellent as well. Portions were good and I had some to bring home.
4	5	1	0	0	Excellent and consistent..reasonable prices
4	3	0	2	0	The baked ziti with sausage is a good choice. Pizza is alright but you have to like a thicker and more toasted crust.
4	5	0	0	0	Hot dang diggity dawg, this is as good as it gets! ...  ... In all seriousness, throw any of your plans for tonight out the window and go to Nick's. Their pizza is superb, their bread is binge-worthy, and the wait is short. Even their plain cheese pizza has a similar taste to my various fantasies of feasts in the heavenly afterlife. ...  ... They also have a variety of pasta dishes and other fancy Italian things. Whatever. I just love the pizza.
4	2	6	4	2	************Like Eating In The Back Seat Of A Yugo*********** ...  ... The servers can't even maneuver between tables. ... YOU WILL rub elbows with the neighboring table. ...  ... ***********Use To Be A Top Notch Italian Restaurant********* ...  ... It seems they went on an aggressive expansion plan......about 5 years ago. ... The food quality slipped.......BIG TIME. ... Prices rose.......BIG TIME. ...  ... Now its kinda of..........an over priced Olive Garden. ... .......and in my opinion Olive Garden is DRECK .
4	5	0	0	0	In the 13 years that we've been going to Nick's, every visit has been perfect!  Perfect food, perfect service, perfect atmosphere! By far my favorite Italian restaurant!
4	2	9	24	13	We go to Nick's about once a year.  For the most part our experience has been positive. ...  ... I tend to order pasta dishes while my wife enjoys the Chicken Parmigiana.  Both could be better and the place can get crazy crowded at times.  The tight space and food reminds me of Giuseppe's on 28th http://www.yelp.com/biz/giuseppes-on-28th-phoenix  Though I like their food better. ...  ... Sometimes you just don't feel like cooking.  When it comes to Italian food, how many of us want someone else to do it better?  In this department, Nick's is just okay.  ...  ... The new management at New York 51 Pizzeria (formerly Redendo's) up the block might have the edge on Nick's. Time will tell. ...  ... http://www.yelp.com/biz/new-york-51-pizzeria-scottsdale ...  ... Sorry!
4	4	1	2	1	Let me preface this by stating my mother is FROM ITALY. Finally ordered from here after hearing countless good reviews about this place from multiple sources.  Ordered takeout on a Friday night as the wait was for over an hour.  I ordered the baked ziti, the bf ordered the lasagna. This place is legit.  It's fantastic.  Absolutely great food, quality ingrediants and made me really feel like I was eating in Italy.   ...  ... The people are super nice and very polite, which is always nice.  The only downside is this place is packed all of the time and it is really very small.  The parking location is next to a Circle K, which always carries a very interesting aroma.  Aside from that this will be a repeat establishment.
4	5	0	0	0	Very good! Probably best to get there early, it's a small establishment and can get quite busy. The calamari and bruschetta were excellent! I had Chicken Marsala which was very tasty, but a humongous portion! I had a taste of the marinara sauce and Italian ice cream and both were quite good. Definitely recommend it!
4	4	4	6	7	Thanks to Groupon, we found the gem in our neighborhood.  The dining room is small, so when it's busy, tables are tough to find.  There are only a few chairs next to the hostess stand and it can get really crowded there during peak hours. ...  ... We've ordered the following menu items: ...  ... Gnocchi w/Gorgonzola Cream Sauce, $10.95 ... http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nicks-scottsdale?select=T5quiIz0RxafYkagpoC7qQ#T5quiIz0RxafYkagpoC7qQ ...  ... 10" Sausage & Pepperoni Pizza w/Gorgonzola Cheese, $9.45 ... http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nicks-scottsdale?select=vIKi17UY1fSyVSRfNzISQw#vIKi17UY1fSyVSRfNzISQw ... http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nicks-scottsdale?select=U4ODmyuyxB7jSYmpbBIyAw#U4ODmyuyxB7jSYmpbBIyAw ...  ... Baked Ziti, $9.95 ... http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nicks-scottsdale?select=HHBLkID7bubiO48cia_3Xg#HHBLkID7bubiO48cia_3Xg ...  ... The Gnocchi & Baked Ziti is delish.  They cook the Gnocchi just the way I like it, al dente.  The Better Half enjoys her Baked Ziti with Gorgonzola Cream Sauce and they oblige her with that special order. ...  ... The Pizza is very very good.  I love Pizza and they do a great job here. ...  ... The service here is good, I wouldn't say excellent. ...  ... Return Factor - 90%
4	3	0	2	1	Wasn't especially impressed. Found it odd that the staff was busy getting frks to the empty tables rather than customers (us) with food on the table. Note to staff: get utensils to sitting customers first.  ...  ... Everywhere I've ever been, when it says Chicken Parmesan on the menu, it means breaded. Theirs wasn't. If you're going to deviate from 95% of the restaurants in the world, maybe you ought to put that fact on the menu?  ...  ... Might eat here in an emergency Italian craving, but won't go out of my way.
4	5	0	1	0	This is a simple-looking Italian restaurant in a small strip shopping center, but don't let the looks deceive you.  The menu is varied, and every dish I've tried has been fantastic.  The Calzone is stuffed full of excellent cheese and whatever ingredients you choose to add.  It's sized as a meal for two.  The lobster raviolis are excellent, with lots of real lobster chunks.  No fake fillers or small quantities here.  Even the salads are exceptionally prepared and great. ...  ... It's a little ways from the more commercial parts of the city, but worth driving out to.
4	3	0	0	0	Nick's spaghetti bolognese is what I crave on one of those "eat your feelings, carb overload" type of days. It is soo good. Unfortunately everything else I've tried (pizza, chicken Marsala, Alfredo) were all just so-so at best.  I've learned my lesson though and will continue to return for the bolognese!
4	5	0	1	0	Been coming to Nicks for years and its still my favorite place. I keep coming back for the Chicken Parm and cannolis!! This place is a staple in Scottsdale, best Italian food around for miles. I dream about their food. Authentic, classic, innovative - they have it all.
4	4	1	0	2	The Veal Marsala deserves 5 Stars. ... Service was good, but the appetizer came out just a couple minutes before our entrees.  Plus, we weren't able to make a reservation, and even though we called ahead, we still had to wait 30 minutes for a table.   ... At least they gave us some water while we waited. ... My girlfriend thought her pizza was "just OK," but it was definitely a good value. ...  ... I would come back just to have the Veal Marsala again.  ... Overall though: ALMOST excellent.
4	3	1	3	1	Got a touch lost one day and happened to drive by Nick's and decided to give it a go for dinner that night.  I had the Fettuccine Alfredo with Grilled Chicken and my fiancee had the Baked Ziti with Sausage.  Get the Ziti if you order either of these two dishes.   ...  ... The Fettuccine was very al dente, which some prefer - but it was almost to the point of under-cooked and close to crunchy, not my thing.  The Baked Ziti on the other hand was very good.  The sausage on it was cooked perfectly and the noodles didn't taste nearly as under-cooked.   ...  ... If you order only one thing from this place get the Tiramisu!  That dessert definitely put this place back in play for us to return.  It was light, airy, delicious and not too sweet or too mocha-y.  My non-coffee drinking fiancee loved it and my addicted coffee self loved it too!   ...  ... Overall: B- (with a huge A+ for the dessert)
4	3	0	0	0	This review is only for the location on Frank Llyod Wright.  This location is the main one, which the owner frequents most often.  It is open and very light.  Everyone sits at a table, there are no booth and no bar.  The food here is a bit better then the location on Tatum.  The pizza is a great price.  Large cheese pie is less than $13.00...the sauce is  a tad salty but if you ask them to put extra basil on the cheese it lessens the taste of the salt.  The pasta here is better than the other location and the wait staff it good.  There are many other places to eat Italian food in the area, but this place is good with the same crowd coming in day after day.  The meatball subs and seafood pasts dish are pretty tasty.  Great inexpensive place for linch.
4	5	0	0	0	Love this place! I have been going for a few years now and have never been dissatisfied with a dish or service. For starters, they bring out a great assortment of bread. I have tried many of their dishes and they have all been very good. I love to get the grilled vegetable salad with grilled chicken and a side of the arrabiata sauce. I have found it to be the perfect combination. My boyfriend gets the chicken marsala with a side of fettuccine alfredo. The fettuccine is amazing. They make the pasta in house and cook it perfectly. Great neighborhood restaurant!
4	2	0	0	0	Our first time at this restaurant and was not impressed.  It was kind of busy and we decided to wait for the 15 or so minuets. A party of four arrived about  10 minutes after us and were seated after about 5 minutes. After about 10 more minutes we were seated at a table in a high traffic area and were continually being bumped. They did have a seating list but were seating people out of order.  The bread was cold and dry and the salad was nothing special ( way over priced for what you got).  Pizza was above average and my wife ordered gnocchi it was not traditional very thick and gummy. We ordered the tiramisu which was pretty good and the service was good. We will probably pass on returning, the place was very chaotic and loud.  Definitely not a place to go if you want to talk unless you like using your outside voice.
4	4	0	0	0	Saw this on our way home today and decided to stop in - not a lot of stuff in the little strip mall so I assumed it was just a pizza place. ...  ... Boy was I wrong. As soon as you walk in the door you see that it's a little more special than 'just another pizza place'. It's clean and cozier than I expected from the outside. My husband ordered the Spaghetti Bolognese and I ordered Chicken Ravioli. Their pastas are handmade (I didn't review the entire menu close enough to see if they all are, but there was quite a good selection of home made pasta). ...  ... The garlic bread is VERY yummy, I had a piece while we waited for dinner and then used a couple more to schmutz around in the pink sauce served with my ravioli. ...  ... Our waiter was Anthony - and he looked like he was from New York for sure! He was very polite, he and the other gentleman were very attentive. There was a cute blonde gal working tables, too, she was a little chatty for me - just when I was ready to point out how chatty she was to my husband she started talking about how good the pizza was at some other restaurant. ...  ... Then she mentioned that their pesto was better than "ours". Um. . . . Really? Then she mentions something about another restaurant to yet another table before we left this evening. I neglected to do my Review from the restaurant, so I forgot what that particular subject was about. Quite annoying to hear the wait staff discuss what they like about another restaurant, over THEIR restaurant..... especially annoying when it's the same food type as the one that they work in. ...  ... Nonetheless, we loved Nick's and will be going back. Maybe next time we'll try their pizza, I've ready a couple of reviews about how good it is.
4	4	0	2	0	Very good Italian Food, but didn't quite live up to my expectations...   ...  ... Wait For Table = 2.5 stars ... Service = 3.2 stars ... Atmosphere = 4.0 stars ... Beverages = 3.7 stars ... Appetizers = 5.0 stars ... Entre = 3.9 stars ... Dessert = 4.4 stars
4	5	4	5	5	Where has this place been hiding. Took my wonderfully beautiful girlfriend here on a surprise date after we saw a movies. This is one of her favorite restaurants and I wanted to try it out. Plus take her out for a nice dinner. ... Everything was very nice. Very unassuming little place in a nondescript strip mall. Everyone inside was very friendly. The food was amazing. Some of the best Americanized Italian food I have ever had. Of course if you want authentic Italian food you have to go to Italy or make it yourself. I got the risotto and my girlfriend got the gnocchi. We shared. Trying bites of each others dishes. I couldn't decide which one I like more. They were both so good. The gnocchi was very tender and fresh but the risotto was no slouch either. It was a great meal. Even the bread they brought out was very good. The price was very reasonable too. Not as expensive as I was thinking it was going to be. ... We will definitely be back. I really want to try a pasta dish because I am told they use fresh homemade pasta. I think if I didn't like this place my girlfriend would have dumped me on the spot.
4	4	0	0	0	If you like calamari get the Di Mare salad.   It is served with a house vinaigrette dressing, nice & light! and loaded with grilled calamari & shrimps.  As I allergic to shrimps, I get it with extra calamari and it is so delicious, perfect for a low carb diet! The servers here are so friendly and helpful, I frequent this establishment especially for lunch that they k ow ,e and being a creature of habit, I always order the same item, the Di Mare salad, "sin camarones"!
4	4	2	0	0	Nick's saved the day before baby Jesus's birthday! ...  ... We'd had a leisurely xmas eve full of working out, breakfast tacos and going to the movies. Suddenly, it was that late-afternoon/early-evening time (around 4:45-5:00) and we found hanger levels quickly approaching. We had planned for  a Christmas Eve feast at Oregano's like last year, but those assholes decided to give their employees an extra holiday day off. What is this, communist Russia? ...  ... So we drove aimlessly and tried to figure out who the heck was open on December 24. As we rounded the bend of FLLW Blvd. I remembered my old coworkers used to love coming to Nick's for their lunch special, and that we were in close proximity of the place. Boyfriend gave them a quick call to see if they would be open and sure enough, they would be until 9:00 p.m. DONE. ...  ... We were one of only about three other tables in the place when we got there, but like I said it was a weird "very early-bird diner" time. Had we eaten at a regular time, we'd have to wait, as I saw each and every table fill up in our time dining (and a line forming!--make a reservation if you want to eat at a "normal" dinner time.) ...  ... We split lots of things, because hey, holidays, fat, lazy, etc. We started with the bread basket, using the garlic and rosemary (!!) infused olive oil on the table for dipping. I could have made a meal out of the garlic knots in the basket and that godly oil. Perfection. Next was the bruschetta, because carbs are what baby Jesus wants us to eat. Their version uses tomato, onion, capers, black olives and with a shake of parm and a drizzle of aforementioned EVOO, it was outstanding. ...  ... We decided to be bad and each order a pasta dish, plus a small Mediterranean pizza. I KNOW. WHO CARES. I'M WORKING OUT LOTS LATELY. I opted for the penne carciofi, which had an abundant amount of artichoke chunks dispersed throughout the pasta, all covered in a bright, lemony white wine sauce. It was absolutely delicious, and when the sauce was scooped up with the bread? DONE. BF got the fettuccine with homemade sausage that came with peppers, onions and a marinara/wine sauce and said it was outstanding. The Med pizza had all the standards: kalamatas, spinach, sun-dried tomatoes, arti's, feta. It was tasty, don't get me wrong--but to be honest, the pasta was the star of the show. We both said that we need to come back to try EVERYTHING on the menu. The only thing I would have liked more was an offer for cracked black pepper and crushed red pepper , but to be honest, we were so busy hoovering our food that we didn't even ask for these...I'm sure they are available. ...  ... Service was good. I don't know why but I was absolutely chugging water that evening, which I try not to do in restaurants, but both our server and the busser/food runner were quick with refills. Our server's name was Tony and he looked like a tiny Soprano's extra. Glorious. Like I said, the place was absolutely packed when we left, so Nick's knows what they are doing. We will soon be part of the wait crowd!
4	4	0	0	0	We love to come here for a casual date night. I always order the Pasta Primavera with gluten free penne and cream sauce. It's not too heavy and tastes fresh. I love and respect that they offer a gluten free pasta. I would love to see them expand the options, or at least offer gluten free bread :)
4	4	1	0	0	I drove past this place and thought man these guys dont look like they'll be busy. I walked in on a Tuesday night at it was Packed! That was nice to see. Seems to be an authentic family and felt like a little Italy. I had the Mediterranean Pizza and the Ziti. The pizza was delicious and I was surprised. The ziti was pretty good as well. Over all I will stop by again.
4	4	0	0	0	First time at Nick's Saturday night.  The place was packed but it was only 10 minutes before we were seated.  Ordered the chianti which was reasonable for $7.  The bread served in the basket consisted of various types--regular italian, foccacia, garlic knot?   All fresh.  The olive oil on the table which was infused with rosemary and roasted garlic was a nice accompaniment to the bread.  Ordered Shrimp Fra Diavolo which was served with linguini.  It was good, but disappointed that the portion consisted of only 5 shrimp.  6 would have been minimally more acceptable.  How do Chinese restaurants serve 10 shrimp for almost half the price? How do they do that?    ... Hubby had chicken with eggplant which was a special order.  He had it with vegetables--broccoli, cauliflower & carrots.  The portion was very generous and the up charge for the special order was $2 over the chicken parmagiana price.  I thought that was fair.   ... Jeff was our server.  He answered the questions we had about the menu and was very attentive throughout our meal.   ... I will definitely try Nick's again maybe at lunch to check out their sandwiches.
4	4	0	0	0	What a lovely modern Italian place hiding in a strip mall in Scottsdale! Visited family recently and they took us out to dinner, practically off the plane. A nice, quiet interior, tastefully decorated and with very good service - solicitous without being pushy, a rarity these days. The food was very well prepared, in reasonable portions and served with flair. And best of all, it was exactly what the menu described! I would have given it 5 stars, but there were just too many table crammed into the rather small space. This is the one establishment I would happily return to on our next visit.
4	4	0	0	0	I absolutely love this place. The food is always outstanding. The service is very good as well. The atmosphere is a little bit cafeteria like but they make up for it with the food and service. Prices are reasonable. There isn't much of a waiting room so if there is a waiting list, you are standing around kind of in the restaurant. The restaurant is small so some of these things are a bit awkward.
4	5	0	0	0	Nick's is always a stopping point for us when we are in Scottsdale.  We have been going to Nick's for years.  Great Italian food at very affordable prices.  Nick is almost always there when we go so it is always nice to say hello.  Staff is great but we do miss our favorite server, Terry, as she has retired.  Weekends can be pretty busy, especially in season so go early to avoid a wait.  They will take reservations for parties of 6 or more only.  Looking forward to many more years to come at Nick's!
4	4	0	1	0	Great service, great food. 4 stars only because leftovers so caked with butter I was unable to remove leftovers from styrofoam. I had to drain a solid two tablespoons of butter from microwaved leftovers.
4	2	0	0	0	Nice restaurant inside. Nice location. Excellent staff. I dont like leaving negative reviews, but the food was "edible" at best. No flavor and everything tasted like it was out of a can. I'm glad we had a groupon that someone bought us or else I would have had a tough time coughing up the $50 for dinner. Maybe it was an off night for them...who knows. Don't think we'll be going back. Try Marco's Italian bistro up the road. Great place.
4	2	0	0	0	This may be the most over rated place ever!  OMG the stuff is so absolutely average at best. The staff when you walk in remixed me of an episode of restaurant stakeout. I tried it but I won't be back.
5	1	1	2	1	You sneaky little bastards you. I curse your existence.  ... I get home yesterday to find one of many credit card offers from what I though was capital one credit card.  ... I always get offers from them so I figure why not finally get a card from them.  ...  ... I call in to a automated system, plug in all my info and right as I hang up I look at the credit card promotional offer paper I got in the main and I noticed that it's not Capital One, rather it's Credit One.  ... You pieces of donkey feces.  ... Their logo looks identical to that of Capital One, which I'm sure was done on purpose. ... I immediately try to call back to cancel my application, but it was impossible to get an actual person to talk to, no matter how many times you pressed 0!  ... Finally I googled them to find another phone number and after struggling with the machine again I got to a operator after a 20 minute wait.  ... It was some foreign lady with a hard accent and could not understand me. I had to repeat everything about 5 times  ... Finally she understood me and canceled my application (at least I hope she did).  ...  ... Sly bastards.
5	1	1	4	0	I forgot to mention that I when I accidentally signed up (because I thought they were capital one) they also sent me a $75 bill, for no reason! Before I even got the card (not that I wanted the card).  ...  ... Jerks, I hope this crappy company goes out of business.
5	4	1	1	0	They're okay.  I get to pay my bills online so I'm a fan.
5	1	1	5	0	Fees! Fees! Fees! Don't sign up for this card. They will charge you a fee for opening the card. They will charge you a fee for authorized user. They will charge you a fee for the "premium design" of the card itself. And, they will charge you a fee to pay the fees online! I would give them zero stars if I could!
5	1	0	4	0	For starters, why are six very valid complaints filtered?  Maybe this one will get filtered too. ...  ... I love how they show their physical location on the map as being at the airport. ...  ... I wish I had read these reviews before I signed up.  Their latest stunt was to charge me a monthly fee that pushed me over my paltry limit by $1.17 and they sent an "overlimit" to my credit report.  Nice!  I'm trying to rebuild my credit and they are going to do more damage. ...  ... I just moved too, and I'm afraid to put in a change of address!  Closingthis account ASAP.
5	5	3	6	0	I am giving this card 5 stars because I read all the other reviews and am surprised by how many people are mad that they signed up for a card without reading all the info first! You THOUGHT it was Capital One? That's your fault right there! You're giving all your personal info to these people, maybe you should know who is receiving it. I knew I was paying a $75 fee for signing up, they just took it out of my credit and I paid it (in full!) on my first bill. Sure, no one reads all the terms and conditions on everything they sign up for, but you read the first damn page with all the info and the NAME of the company. I have received no surprise fees (as of yet, of course), I try to pay my card in full when it is due (except this last time, I paid half), and I use the plain grey card they sent me because paying extra to have a picture of my dogs face on the card just didn't seem worth it!
5	1	0	4	0	Worst Credit Card I've owned to date. Seriously no matter what situation you are in you are better off not working with this bank. ...  ... Signed up got hit with a hidden $75 fee right off the bat. Hidden fees EVERYWHERE. They take the notion of getting "big banked" to a new level.  ...  ... Made an online payment 3 days late for double the minimum payment.  I thought i was paying a payment and a late fee. Turns out I was making one for the payment I missed and one for the payment not due for 27 days.I get calls days later saying I need to pay more money as I made two payments toward my card and no payment toward late fee. I ask can you just move the payment not due for 27 days to the late fee and I'll make another payment before it is due. Them - "Sir our system doesn't do that. We are trying to help you out today. Don't you see all the help we are offering. Now I need your debit card to charge the late fee to"  ...  ... Mind boggling. Easily the worst, most aggressive horrifying card I've owned to date.
5	1	1	3	0	One of the worst customer service ever. I've had my card for over 5 years. I've been past due on the payment date, but never delinquent (30 days past due). I appreciate reminder phone calls but their customer service is out sourced to India. I received a reminder call recently from a male person who obviously spoken English as a second language, was extremely rude and condescending. He was literally interrogating me on why I hadn't paid my bill. When I asked to speak to a supervisor, the supervisor wasn't even sure what credit card they were calling about. I tried to call the next day and couldn't talk to anyone in the U.S., even when I asked for the collections department. I have a small balance so this will be paid in full and I may only keep it for my credit history and emergencies. P.S. Do they pick their names out of a hat? Jennifer. Really!  BTW, Capital One's customer service is excellent!
5	1	0	1	0	I had this card for about two years, just paid it off.  Not recommended as this card is designed to make money off persons who have bad credit, so they can hit you with fees.  I don't like the outsourcing customer service outside of US, when there is adequate talent pool in Las Vegas looking for work.  I asked the US customer rep to talk to CEO about this, she said write him, I asked for his email, she said no, I need to write a letter, who the heck writes letters anymore??
5	1	0	0	0	This credit bank is a scam based pariah!  First I received an unsolicited credit card in the mail.  I chose NOT to "activate" because I did NOT apply.  After one week, I received BILL for $75.00 as an annual fee!  When I called this "bank" to state this information and asked for PROOF of an application, I was promptly disconnected.  BEWARE!  This is possibly aimed at the elderly who would not notice details but would rather simply pay.
5	1	1	4	0	Absolute scam. Preys on ignorant consumers. These people should be thrown in jail.
5	1	0	1	0	I only wish I had read the review first on this company.  Sadly I was also hit with a lot of "hidden" fees and it was all in the fine print supposedly.  They hit you with a $75 annual fee and a fee for which type of card print you want.  When I called to request that the fees be credited or rescinded the girl (in India) said there wasn't anything she could do but deduct $25.  I said I still would like to cancel the account and she said that's fine but never deducted the fees she initially gave me since I'm now cancelling the account.  A complete nightmare and poor business practices of this company.   ... Awful...do no get suckered in to doing business with these people.
5	1	0	4	0	$100 in fees in less than a month and I haven't even used the card!!! RUN RUN RUN! I'll agree...easily the worst card ever! But at some point the US Government will get a hold of their scam and they will be shut down.  I have had the card less than a month and will pay the $100+ balance and close it out just to save the grief! Should have seen the HUGE red flag when they called and called for me to actually activate my card! Just read our warning and learn from our mistakes.  I'm shocked they have gotten away with it for so long, but it's only a matter of time.  I'll be filing my case with BBB and spreading the word. All we can do is do the same and try to help others from making the same mistake. And to Credit One Bank, enjoy the ride cause your days are numbered!
5	5	0	3	0	Im with Kimberly B...this is a card for people rebuilding credit.  Mine got tanked due to a divorce.  I have been rebuilding, and started with a $300 limit, and it is now at $1250.  I do not carry a balance, ever.  If you need to carry a balance, then you haven't learned your lesson that got us all to this type of a card in the first place.  It you are a day late, you haven't learned your lesson either. A day late is a  day late. You can sign up to get reminders to pay a week in advance.  Also, it is NOT A HIDDEN $75 fee.  It isn't hidden!  It's clearly disclosed, along with the $8.95 monthly fee.  People who place blame where it doesn't belong aren't going to take responsibility for getting their credit back in order.  Get over it.  It's a card to rebuild credit...you are going to pay for the privlege of doing so.  I will probably keep it awhile longer, as length of time you have an account open adds to your score too.  Educate yourselves people. Stop blaming the company for being a business and take your finances into your own hands.
5	1	0	1	0	After being approved, I was mailed the card. Minimum limit, although I have other cards. Initially, I thought it was a Capital One invitation. Had I realized it was not, I would have further researched this company and passed. I did not receive a statement. Called the number and was told I would be charged an additional $9.95 to make payment. I did not approve that. I would wait and mail a check...they were going to cut the PAYMENT FEE in half...again, NO thank you. They waived the fee. Then the rep insisted, said we were GOING TO UP my payment by $25.00. Um, NO. I'm making more than your minimum, I've NEVER been harassed by any company to UP my payment amount...the first rep then handed me off to a Customer Service Specialist...WHY? I don't know....AFTER another few minutes, he passed me off to Customer Service Rep THREE, who ONCE AGAIN, tried to INSIST I UP my payment. I have been on the phone and wasted more than 25 minutes just to make a simple payment. No thanks. There are PLENTY OF GOOD companies that will assist you in rebuilding your credit, Victorias Secret is one, and they are great to deal with. They offered me my first card following my divorce...!  And it looks pretty good on me, I would say give it a go! In my personal opion, I would say... Think twice about this company.  If you can afford all their FEES, put your money away and get a prepaid credit card from your bank. It's YOUR money AND you can rebuild your credit, with NO OUTRAGEOUS FEES!! Their fees are VERY HIGH...there are other cards with more moderate fees, better customer service and reputation. Customer service is contracted in India, ( not a bad thing, but come on, if your an American Company. Outsourcing customer service is pretty low. Even DirecTV discontinued outsourcing after years of problems and complaints. Reps are hard to understand, and that's just a fact, not an opinion. I'm not calling this out as a bias, I had to ask a few times to have something repeated. There was never once in MY conversation a "thank you, excuse me, or how can I help you...?" that goes a long way with ME. Unpleasant to deal with, and take A LOT of your time...(how much are YOU WORTH an hour),  and a hard sell to increase your payment...  For me, NO THANKS. I will not use this card any longer. Thanks, but no thanks. - Feb 09, 2014
5	1	0	1	0	This is honestly the WORST card I have ever owned. I pay more than the minimum payment and my balance NEVER seems to go down. I called their customer service and can never get a straight answer. Their customer service department is BY FAR THE RUDEST customer service I have ever dealt with. I cut up my card as I did my other credit cards.. so I went on to make my payment and I was for some reason locked out. I could not reset my password because I dont have my CC. I called customer service and this stupid indian lady kept telling me she would mail me a pin. I could NOT for the life of me make her understand I wanted my password reset. For about 5 minutes this went on until I said "can i please speak to someone who knows what they are doing" she YELLED back at me that she KNOWS what she is doing. I said I would like to speak to a supervisor.. she said "may I ask what this is in regards to" UM DUH! I said I dont want to talk to you anymore. She kept me on hold for 7 minutes and her attitude was alot nicer when she came back on. She FINALLY figured out I wanted my PASSWORD reset and goes h no sorry I am not able to do that. I thought you wanted a new pin because your CC wouldnt work.. WOW I told her 4 times throughout the call that I CUT UP my card. I had missed a payment by 1 day and I called customer service and asked if they could reverse the 25 fee..this dude proceeds to give me a lecture about how I need to learn to pay my bills on time. I told him it was an accident and he said "there are no excuses man, we will not do this for you again" NICE CUSTOMER SERVICE DUDE!!!  RUN! THIS CARD IS NOT WORTH IT!!! THE FRUSTRATION OF DEALING WITH CUSTOMER SERVICE IS HORRIBLE.
5	1	0	5	0	I am on hold with customer service again and this is my first payment. I only got this card for my sons use. I simply opened a letter with a Credit Card offer and logged in and the card was sent. I am not complaining about the fee because that was my mistake but after the first month of usage I started receiving phone calls from East Indians who you can hardly understand asking me for payments over the phone which I NEVER do. So I came home attempted to log into my account but couldn't so I called on a Saturday "closed". Called Monday and asked about my problems with logging on and was told that my account was locked because my account was temporarily closed because I didn't make my payment. ...  ... Ok, first I was never sent a statement. I was not at 30 days since first use of card. I couldn't access to make a payment. I couldn't reach anyone on a weekend to discuss payment options. ...  ... Now this brings me to this current time as I am typing this... I am still on hold after making a payment over the phone and being transferred to the (couldn't understand what they said department) but I was hoping to speak to someone that could help with login issues. Anyways another East Indian tells me that I can't access my account until I provide verification from my bank? I asked for what and he replied to open my account again. I said I don't understand I need to access my account to make payments, watch activity, etc. Again, you need to send verification from your bank that you made a payment. Again, I said "huh", I just made an over the phone payment when that payment clears will my account unlock so I can access my account online? He said not until you mail in your verification from the bank.  ...  ... So here is the good part, OK I want to close my account! He says it's already closed! I asked so do you mean to tell me I have no further action to close my account permanently? No, it's closed. I am waiting to speak to a supervisor 33 mins and still holding.  All in all this is one of those cards that will fee you to death and at any point that you use it they will not send statements, lock you out of your account and charge you a $9.95 fee for overt the phone payment. RUN, RUN, RUN as people say. ...  ...  Close your account and stop the bleeding. Ok, 36 mins in and the call was disconnected.  ...  ... I am going to talk to a supervisor and ensure the account is closed at my request and follow through in a couple of weeks. The rough part is I can't go online to ensure the account was closed, you can't trust the people you talk with...... I guess I will have to purchase some type of credit monitoring to ensure they didn't add some type of fee to close my account for which they will send you no statement, no email for this fee that could potentially damage your credit for nonpayment of something you knew nothing about..
5	1	0	2	0	scam!!!! scam!!! scam!!!!  do notttt get this card! i have had many credit cards in my life including gold amex business and personal.. we developed credit issues because of medical bills. we ended up in bankruptcy. after a time we were working on rebuilding credit. i received a capital 1 account.... i worked on good payment history. soon, i received another offer. credit 1.....  horrific experience!!!  when i activated card is when a fee was assessed... then on top of high interest there is a large fee if you lose card and if you call to make phone payment it is a $9.95 fee to do this by phone - the problem is it's all scams to cause more fees, fees and more fees. so, ... i called to make payment to pay off account. i paid and asked over and over if all fees and everything were paid off.  i was then shipped over to a guy trying to keep me. i explained my position and said i wanted  to pay and close account... he says ok.. he processed my payment and said all was paid....  ...    i was getting a weird gut feeling that things were not right. ... i decided to call about a month later... the guy says i have a balance of $10.  -----  and there was a $9.95 charge to pay my balance... they  seem to be in control of your credit and extort people and drag them into web of deciept and supper feeeeeeeeeeees!!! i am now forced to file complaint with gov. please take extreme caution!!!!
5	1	1	4	1	Don't open an account with this company. You will regret it I promise. I spent many calls and wrote letters to customer service and to two execs with the company and received no responses. Their Facebook page won't allow any posts which I am sure is to prevent customers from commenting on the extremely poor service. I made multiple calls over the last two months and continue to get transferred from caller to caller including those that speak very little English. On the last call, they disconnected my call after being on about 40 minutes with various customer service representatives.  ...  ... The problem resulted from Credit One processing a payment much later than it should have been processed resulting in a late fee rolling into my March statement. I made a payment over the phone in February with one of their representatives that should have brought my account to a -0- balance. My bank, CapitalOne, also verified that this was an electronic payment and not a check mailed. However, for some reason, Credit One did not process this payment until March 6th, almost two weeks after I made the payment over the phone. This resulted in a late payment of 29.07 being assessed on my account in my March statement on 3/5. I made calls in March and in April trying to get this resolved, but experienced horrendous customer service. As a result of their representatives not being able to resolve this, I had another late payment of 33.41 assessed on 4/5.  ...  ... You can't reach anyone at their corporate offices as well and NO REPONSE FROM CUSTOMER SERVICE. I am moving forward with a complaint with the BBB.
5	1	0	2	0	Horrible Credit card... This Credit One Bank Visa Platinum is an absolute scam. They charge a Daily finance so even though you paid your balance in full they still charged interest. You can not use this card without being charged a fee, a ridiculous fee, not to mention the enrollment fee. They also charge you $9.99 if you want to pay early? that's F'd up I'm done with these guys and will stop my card with them and continue to bash them as they continue to suck. Oh by the way I received an email after my balance was due in order for them to slap me with a $25 late fee... Seriously Credit One goto Hell. The owner is probably a son of a sea biscuit anyway. The fact of the matter is this I don;t need you ... but you need me.
5	1	1	2	1	I have power of attorney for my elderly, ailing mother. Mailed it to them 2 weeks ago because they don't have a fax (yeah, right) and still not showing it in their system.  ...  ... He got my mom on the line to approve me speaking to them about her account which she did but all he would do is give me her balance and started hounding me on when *I* was going to make payments on her account for her. ...  ... I explained that I was calling to cancel the card (which the power of attorney authorized) and to make payment arrangements for the money to AUTOMATICALLY come out of HER account starting at the end of this month when she gets her check. ...  ... He then tells me that isn't acceptable and something has to be paid NOW and that I should pay it from MY own account. ...  ... Transferred to a "supervisor" who then argues with me that I should mail the Power of Attorney again (only has a PO Box, no certified mail) OR I should call customer service to ask if they have the Power of Attorney.  (So, I am supposed to hang up with him, call the same number again to ask if they have it????)  It was lost on him how idiotic that was. Why do I have to hang up with Credit One just to call Credit One back? HE should contact customer service while I am on the phone to verify the Power of Attorney. ...  ... I have NEVER had a company make it so hard to arrange to GIVE THEM MONEY!!! ...  ... This will be the last bill of hers that gets paid after the other companies get money
5	1	0	1	0	Caveats: ...  1) People always nice on the phone. ...  2) Payments processed like typical low end credit card company, so certain amount of money games expected. ... 3) The problem with this company are its customer service protocols. Their online system gets hacked, account suspended, OK fine, not a bad idea. But the hoops to go through to reestablish, which I followed & seemed to have vanished from your premises, are so cumbersome I gave up & closed the account.  ...  ... Guys, if you're making money doing with your Godawful practices well then bully for you. Your rating here on Yelp is tanked, were you to do something about it you might earn a whole lot more... ... Best Wishes, Good Luck & Good Riddance....
5	1	0	1	0	I have had this Credit One Bank Visa since March.  All going ok until one month I went over my credit limit by a $1.00 and some change.  They were calling to inform me that I had gone over my credit limit and they were requesting a payment!   The other wierd thing was the bill wasn't even due yet!!  I was like What!!  Your calling and the bill is not due yet?   Crazy!!  Then as someone else said, these East Indians!!  Ughhh...  Can't understand them!!  I say Why Me!!  Then, I asked to speak to this guy Mark's supervisor!   His name was Eric.  I let this guy have it!  Why in the world make a collection call when the bill isn't due yet??  So, I started doing some research on thus company!  I'm paying my bill  and closing this acct!  I admit got this to help my credit, but i can't deal with a company like this!!  It's so wrong what they do! ... Thanks to all the reviews!!
5	1	0	1	0	This is by far THE worst credit card company I've ever dealt with! Even if you are absolutely desperate to obtain a credit card to rebuild your credit score, DO NOT do business with these people. You will regret it. This company prays on the vulnerable and deliberately sets up people to go into debt. STAY AWAY.......STAY FAR AWAY from these dangerous dishonest crooks!!
5	1	0	1	0	WORST card ever!!! Don't fall in their trap. WORST customer service. Unfortunately they have nooooooo idea about customer service. Don't fall in their trap. Rip off!!!!!!!!
5	3	0	1	0	Had the card for nearly a year and hadn't had any issue. My balance has been 0 for some time now. Recently someone got ahold of my CC number and some fraudulent charges were made on the card. This was my first interaction with customer service. ... The complaint I have with the card is as far as when fraudulent charges are made, they send the claim to the "fraud department" to investigate. However, they can not give you the number to contact fraud department to speak about your case with them directly. They say they don't have access to the department. That seems very strange and fishy to me. It doesn't really put you at ease when in the midst of fraudulent charges are on your card that you can't speak with the department trying to sort the situation out. They also have a time frame ranging from 90 days as to how long your investigation can take. ... Thankfully, the department did find that my charges were not made by me in about 2-3 weeks and my card has already been credited.
5	1	0	0	0	Yelp please give us a Zero star score. This is an awful company. They prey upon the poor, minorities and those who truely want to make their credit better. They charge fees like a Las Vegas Craps table ( the expensive ones) Charging hundreds of dollars in imaginary fees a month. They can't answer your complaints. They have a phone bank in the Phillipines with customer disservice employees who you can hear in the background all reading the same script. Frightening that this exists in America
5	1	0	0	0	I would have given this a ZERO but yelp won't allow a post. I've had this card for 3 years, it was one of the first cards I got approved for on my own post divorce. I manage my credit because I am building and have never been late although they make that hard when you have to pay by their time zone, even online. I made a payment online 6 months ago and even though I  checked the box for it to come from my checking, it defaulted to my savings which is a different acc. number. I called them to let them know, before it came back and paid at that time, they cut me off online bill pay and cut the card off. I explained over and over and they requested a letter from my bank! I refused, I had never been late once. Fine, this is a chance for me to pay it off. I noticed my balance got higher not using the card! I can not get anyone on the phone in the states--out  sourcing makes it difficult to resolve issues. So frustrated that I want to get a lawyer to mediate but that would cost more than the balance. This is a fee based card that makes NO SENSE!!! They charged me 29.00 to get an increase on a card that I cannot charge on!!! They charged me 29.00 for being late on my payment when I called and made the payment. They read their own notes which stated that I called on my payment due date to check on my status. REALLY! I called to make my payment!!! They updated my card but never charged it..so I'm at fault because I didn't get a confirmation number. My bad, I never do..my bank is my receipt which is how I found out they didn't take the payment out!!!  ... I want these people outta my life!!!    IT'S A SCAM   I still don't know how my card is being charged when it is OFF. They make it hard to be compassionate and tolerant when they offer none back... They are based in Nevada and Georgia, why can't I get someone in the States!!! DO NOT GET THIS CARD!!!
5	1	0	0	0	Their credit card is more for people with no credit, but they approve just about anyone with bad credit too. I had their credit card back in 2001 when they were still FNBM (First National Bank of Marin). I used the card for many years, it was expensive but I had no complaints until I missed a payment one month. I figured I would just double up the next month being young and not grasping the importance of credit. Well, Day 45 the card charged off! That was pretty harsh. I would not do business with them. I was recently offered their card again and was like really?! My credit is way out of their league now.
5	5	0	0	0	Credit One bank will not give credit to anybody with average or above average credit. Its bad credit people only. Yes - you will get a written denial that your credit is too good if you are average credit. ...  ... Credit one bank only deals with risky people. For that reason they charge a lot of fees.  ...  ... Once you understand this it's easier to accept them for what they are. ...  ... In my case I am very happy with them. Back when I could not get any kind of a store card they gave me a chance. With a 300 credit limit (mind u I think I spent like $75 in fees) but off I was to helping my credit. ...  ... I should start by saying before my credit one card I had nothing, 6 collections, 1 lien, like 5 120+ day late on a current account. It was bad. My fico was 546. ...  ... Now im almost at the one year mark and I have a couple other cards, way higher limits, 650 fico and couldn't be happier. ...  ... My options were 1) credit one bank or 2) secured card. I did not care for the secured route as most don't graduate to unsecured.  ...  ... So I am 100% happy though I will likely be canceling them before the 1 year hits as I don't need it now that I have better cards with rewards and no fees. ...  ... Credit one bank (and first premier) are the reason my credit is starting to get better.
6	3	4	0	0	The thing I like best about The Gym is the name. If you need an excuse to go have a drink or what ever and your S.O. asks where you are going, now you can say, "The Gym." That being said, they do have a full bar and a cool drink menu, which I frequent by trying new drinks when ever I eat there. The food is decent bar food, wings and all the trimmings. I have heard its the best place in QC to get your groove on, but I have yet to catch that. If you live out in BFEQC, you should check it out for sure!
6	4	0	0	0	I LOVE the Gym!  They have the best nachoes I've ever eaten.  They are reasonably priced, nice place to hang out with my friends.  The other food I've had is decent, like Heather said it's decent bar food.  Weekends usually feature a DJ or sporting event (UFC pay per view, for a cover).  I've always had decent service.  And their drinks are reasonably priced: $5.50 for a nice rum-filled daquari
6	1	2	0	0	Over-priced drinks. Generic redbull that tastes like crap. Crappy DJ running of equipment and speakers that look like they came from Spencers in the mall. The bartenders & waitresses were fat. The drinks were weak and slow to come. The Guinness was flat. No wings or bar food after 10ish. I'd rather go to Bevmo and order wingstreet.

Tried a beer i've never had Agave wheat,  I think... very good. Bartender was great. Need to go back to try food, still not so sure about this place.

6	2	0	0	0	This price is overpriced and has crappy service. I was there in September and it's was really hot when we were eatting. I asked if they could turn the air down an they told me the air conditioner was broken.
6	3	0	0	0	Nice sports bar. I like the ribs and pulled pork sandwich. Appetizers are pretty standard. Plenty of TV 's in the place. Nice wait staff and fun people at the bar. It's also a nice dining place for family.
6	5	0	0	0	My friends and I did our annual Kentucky Derby Day here Saturday. It couldn't have been better. Jose promised the best breakfast burritos and totally delivered. I highly recommend getting the breakfast burrito with bacon AND ham. WOW that thing was amazing. We ate 5 plates of cheese curds between races because they're awesome. Anyway, if you're in the area anytime, stop by here. I still haven't been here in the evening or on a weekend night so I can't comment on that. Anyway, I personally give a thank you to Jose and our waiter for taking great care of my friends and I.
6	4	0	0	0	It looks like a bar but it has the BEST FOOD IN SAN TAN VALLEY! I was completely blown away by the variety and prices on the menu. How can you not like a place that sells cheese curds? Try them with the spicy wing sauce... you will be addicted. If you order a steak, you will be given restaurant quality with a beautiful presentation of fresh green beans, wax beans, and carrots. If you order a burger, I suggest the Blue Bruiser with blue cheese and onion rings on top. AMAZING.  ...  ... The only thing keeping it from earning five stars is the service. I have been to The Gym four times with my kids and two times we had wonderful service but the other two times the service was slow and rude. Once, the waitress got the order wrong and never apologized and the second time it seemed that she had something better to do than her job. If you are not in a hurry and don't care about service, the food is worth it.

6	1	0	0	0	If your looking for good drinks, good food and a place to hang out, this is NOT your place. Food is subpar, service is lousy and the bathrooms are the dirtiest i have ever seen. Take your family to Native New Yorker.
6	5	0	0	0	Best wings in town and an awesome place to watch sports!
6	1	0	1	1	So gross, I will never come back. The staff was drunk, customers drinking left over beers from other customers left on tables, people with starring problems. Just a low class dive bar that needs a complete make over. Stay away, there are better places to eat - Jack in the Box would be a better choice.
6	4	0	1	0	Overall I like The Gym. However, I have only had burgers and fries, but I have had some nasty burgers and fries served to me at other places. This is my favorite place for a burger. The burger is moist but not so greasy that it makes the bun soggy. The beer is really cold which is important to me, but the prices are high. There is a sign that reads...happy hour all day...but my draft was still $5.00 and we were there @ 4pm so the sign is bogus and there is no happy hour. I still am a fan.
6	1	0	0	0	Arrived 5:30 waited for 15 minutes and still no service, so i gave up. Left unserved. Went to San Tan Flats a few miles down hunt highway 100% better.
6	1	0	1	1	Dirty, run down, and rude staff, not attracting the best patrons. Will make the drive for a better environment next time
6	2	0	0	0	Its an ok place,  but went on a FRIDAY night and they were out of ALL wine, tequila and a huge list of beer. Whaaaaaat? Be prepared or send someone to go stock up.
6	1	1	0	0	Terrible service, we waited almost an hour for our food; they brought us our appetizer but nothing else we told them we're leaving we are paying for the appetizer , we are not paying for anything else and left.
6	4	1	1	1	Chips and Salsa are a must have! Chips come out fresh and hot. Be sure to load the salsa on because you only get 1 free basket, the salsa is so delicious that I'm sure it won't be an issue.  The reuben was amazing, high quality meat, the bread is grilled so no greasy mess on your fingers from butter, and all the flavors meld perfectly together.  The seasoned fries were delicious. Our server was great! She kept our drinks refilled and made sure we had everything we needed. From my perspective it wasn't dirty or run down at all.
6	1	0	1	0	Like old sweat shorts... The Gym stinks. 45 mins for food.. Poor service,  no idea what the specials were,  gross washrooms,  dirty and more.. Even the name doesn't make sense..  Would not bother going back. Avoid if possible.
6	1	0	3	0	This place has turned into a horrible dive bar. I used to go here back in 2009-2010 and it was really good. I stopped going when it started smelling like raw sewage a couple years ago. I figured that I would give it another shot today. Smell is gone.  ...  ... This place needs to be on Bar Rescue. The manager sits at the corner of the bar drinking, cussing, and rolling silverware while the bartender talks to him and his buddies completely ignoring everyone else.  ...  ... Ordered some chicken fingers. 30 minutes later, I ask where they are. The bartender put them in but the kitchen didn't cook them. You can have them in 7 minutes they tell me. No thanks and thanks for checking on them over the last 30 minutes. I get a VERY insincere "sorry". No comp on anything. Manger doesn't say anything except to keep drinking and being a loud mouth.  ...  ... I will never go back to this dump. If you live in STV do yourself a favor and go to someplace like Native New Yorker or even Don Pedro's (which isn't great either but WAY better than the Gym).  ...  ... If I could give zero stars I would.
6	3	1	1	0	Not bad at all. Its a bar so expect under trained employees and staff. Foods good when it comes out and beers cold. Good for kids and families before 9pm. Come check it out. Better than native new Yorker.
6	1	0	0	0	This place use to be fun the first year it opened went back about a month ago what a dive will never go back
6	4	0	0	0	Once they notice you the service is great! Good prices (even if not in happy hou(s)) ... New food menu coming in a couple of weeks the crab is really good, though.
7	4	0	1	1	Ok so Walmart is supposed to be Walmart no matter which Supercenter you go to.  First off of the five I have shopped at in the West Valley they have had 3 different floor plans.  So there is a difference in finding stuff.  I was getting tired of the experience at the one I used to shop at on the way home from work so I checked out 2 others.  This one is by far the best Supercenter I have ever been in.  I have to pass by two others and my apartment to get to this one.  The floors are clean, the parking lot is clean, it is well lit inside, there is plenty of aisle space, all of the shelves are stocked neat and orderly.  They even have produce that looks like you might want to eat it.  They always keep enough registers open to service the number of people in the store.   Everybody that works there is friendly and willing to help you lift, find, whatever.  I have now been going about once a week for 2 months and unless something changes this is MY Walmart.  I did ask a couple of the check out people why this store is so much more pleasant to shop in and one of them responded that the manager has a vision of what his store should be and makes sure the entire staff buys into it. ...  ... Yes it's Walmart but as long as they keep it up this store deserves the 4 I gave it.
7	3	0	0	0	Convenient location and makes for a quick shopping experience.  ...  ... This Walmart is spacious, clean (yes!), and it has a pretty fast checkout. They are always well stocked. The employees are friendly. ...  ... What more can I say?
7	1	0	3	2	I went in for an oil change thinking this would be quick and easy.  Uhm... not so much.  It took her a much longer to check me in than I expected ~ 5-10 minutes ~ and then my van sat there for more than 20 minutes with what seemed to be a small team of technicians floating around.  Worst of all, I wandered away for a few minutes (ya, easy access to the evil store within) and when I come back I see the van pulling away.  HUH!?!?!?!!!!   I asked where the van was going and she said "not far".  Um... I DON'T THINK SO!    I went out side to see where it went and it was parked outside.  WTF?   I go back in, she hollers at tech person sitting in the office and he comes out and says "we had to decline it".  He said there's a dent in the oil pan and its right by the plug.  They cannot service it.  Well OK.  I cannot give you guys a good review.  You WASTED 45 minutes that I didn't have.  The oil pan is not their fault, just the lame, lazy attitude and overall waste of time is.  First and last time I go here. ...  ... Note that their basic oil change is $30.  I the same service plus a carwash AT THE DEALERSHIP for less than $30.  It's not as convenient, but its where I'm going from now on.
7	2	1	1	1	Walmart just runs a gong show everyday. The aisles are always blocked and all the workers are always in a bad mood, I don't blame them though I would be too if I was treated as poorly as they are. Walmart is good for if you need something when your drunk at like 3 in the morning and everything else is closed.
7	1	0	3	1	AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL.  I waited for 32 minutes to get fabric cut. Their assistant manager, Isaiah,  said "oh well it looks like we didn't call anyone into that department". When I called the store and asked for a manager on my cell while IN the store,  their operator said "geeze everyone is asking for a manager today".  Well duh.....your management sucks.  Thanks to this store, I refuse to shop walmart. EVER.
7	3	0	0	0	Convenient, friendly.  A good experience.
7	3	0	1	0	This walmart is huge and always clean and organized.  The attitude of the on floor staff and dressing rooms could be improved greatly but I rarely need help finding anything.   ...  ... Clearance baby stuff is awesome. I often find shirts for $1 ...  ... Produce is skimpy and lacking in verity.  I don't do much of my food shopping here I prefer other stores for that but I do get toys, shampoos, and other items there.
7	1	0	0	0	I hate this walmart MORE than I hate most walmarts!!! this is like that bad rash you have that you HOPE will go away with a trip to the free clinic but only gets worse and your are forced to amputate!!
7	1	0	1	0	In brief, avoid the Wal-Mart auto center at this store.  My wife took our car in to get the tires rotated, the workers told my wife that they refused to rotate the tires as they were so worn down and told her that the car needed immediate replacement of all 4 tires or she was risking a blowout leaving the parking lot.  I told my wife to take the car to Discount tire to see what they said.  When she told the high pressure salesman she was leaving she was told that she was a "fool" and they then took over 10 minutes to find the keys so she could leave.  Discount looked at the tires and said that we had at least 15-20,000 miles left on the tires.   ...  ... Last month the battery on our other car started going out, and when I looked at the battery to see where to take it for the warranty, it was Wal-Mart.  Ok, we had to go back or pay for a new battery (in hindsight should have gone to another Wal-Mart auto, my mistake).   We were told that our alternator was bad and or the started, no way the battery was bad.  I insisted that they test the battery and they again tried to tell me that the alternator was bad even when the battery tester was showing it was in the "replacement" zone.   The guy finally agreed that they would replace the battery for free as it was still under the full replacement time frame.  It gets better.  There was no one else there getting a car worked on.  Not one oil change, tire rotation, wiper replacement, nothing.  Guy told us that it would be 45 to 60 minutes to get the battery replaced.  Fine, I will sit in the waiting room.  His look made it obvious that my waiting did not please him.  Finally after he spent 10 minutes playing on his cell phone he called someone up who took the keys and replaced the battery in 5 minutes.  I don't know what it is that makes these scammers here feel that they can treat customers so poorly, but they do it.
7	1	0	1	0	Worst walmart ever! Go there late on the way home from work sometimes and now I never will again. It's filthy dirty and the service is horrible. They have pallets all over the place and you can't navigate the isles and the stockers don't help accommodate you they will watch you have to go out of your way to come around the other side to grab stuff. Most humans would say let me move this so you can get by or can I grab u something NOPE. Wait 45 minuets in a long line with one register open. Horrible never returning.
8	3	0	1	0	Yayo, Yayo ... I guess owner had a great idea to create a hip looking place where college kids can have few tacos for lunch and few beers for dinner :) but ... I stopped by for a late lunch and decided to try their 4 taco combo. ... I ordered 2 regular and 2 of their 'fusion' style tacos. ...  ... - 3 out 4: meat was too dry (4th was a fish taco) ... - rice ...it shouldn't look like a porridge! ... - tacos ARE small. For this price ($1.50-$2) I get tacos twice as big at my regular taqueria. ...  ... Bottom line: Place looks cool inside but unless they figure out how to cook stuff right - I'm not coming back.
8	4	0	0	0	Ate here for the first time for lunch and was pleasantly surprised. Good food at reasonable prices in a fun atmosphere. Not your typical tex mex, more baja style as the other review mentioned. I know others said the owner is a pest but I appreciated him checking in. Showed that he took pride in his joint. Will come back one evening to check out the live music and extensive beer and tequila menu.
8	3	0	1	1	The tacos suck but their pollo nachos are good. Pastor taco is good. Haven't tried anything else. Service sucks. Waited for thirtyfive minutes for four tacos that sucked. Def coming back for nachos though. We also stumbled in for a band. Hollyfelds? They kicked ass and now I'm a fan. ...  ... I want to try tofu tacos next time.
8	4	0	0	0	I liked this place... reasons. ...  The cashier had a dry sense of humor. ... You can fill up on a couple of bucks. ... The food seems fresh. ... When you ask for hot sauce, they hand you a 2 oz cup a of a homemade habenaro sauce. it's hella hot! ... for the beer drinkers, they seemed to have had a rather large collection to choose from. ... The wood tables. i don't know. they give the place character. ... good job yayo!
8	4	0	0	0	Been going here after meetings at school since it opened couple year ago and this place is still the business. Theres great food holla at the carne asada nahos boommb.. great beer/tequila selections $5 buckets of corona whaaat? great atmosphere the wooden benches are a nice touch. hot sauce is legit! it's a 2oz shot of homemade habanero sauce, handle with care! location is great right across the street from the Union and most of all theres great ownership. ron really takes pride in his small business and it definitely shows. I've also watched UFC fights, seen live bands play, open mic nights, comedy nights, hiphop nights, and theres parties also. Bring $10 MAX and you friend just had a great time.
8	4	0	0	0	YaYo YaYo how could I not have Yelped about you earlier? You are still a quirky little place I fell in love with 3 years ago with a great selection of tacos and drinks. Very laid back. Not your typical taco shop.
8	3	0	1	0	2011 update ...  ... Still a great place to start an evening. But I honestly feel the Vibe has been eaten by 15 year old punk rock homeless youth. Ladies Night is still a great idea. And as far as location its Ideal. But the food is not for me, maybe I've had it too much, it seams inconsistant. But a great place still to drop by for a bucket of beers. ...  ... ***old review*** ... I have to put in a good word for my favorite bar that's actually a bar at all, but rather a cantina. Two happy hours every day from 5 to 7 and 10 to 11 make this place both laid back and dangerous. Their motto should be 'anything goes' as they have long put up with all types of drunken debauchery. The patio is great for long summer nights and the wood tables are free game for any would be artists. Also, one of the greatest pleasures in life is swaying in the hammock with a bucket of beer in easy reach. The beer selection consists of cheep domestics, many American Craft beers and a smattering of fine imports. Also the food makes for perfect fuel to power through a night of intoxication, I recommend the carnitas, vegitarian tofu or bombbay tacos.
8	5	0	0	0	YaYo. Fun to dine, fun to drink, fun to say. ...  ... The carnitas is the best.  It's braised all day like it should be. The owner told me the Clinton campaign people used to come in when they were in town for the primaries in 2008, because their headquarters were nearby; they would all order the carnitas until it was gone, because they heart it so much. ...  ... Also, the quinoa salad and tortilla chips are my favorite sides to get.  Yayo's must be the only cheap place where you can order quinoa right now.
8	2	1	3	2	Saw a bunch of reviews of Yayo Taco, both good and bad, and decided to stop in and and experience this place for myself.  There are student specials there and being that me and my fiance are students, we took advantage of the deals.  I also heard from a few friends that the vegetarian/vegan tacos were pretty good and decided to try those as well.  The cashier (who also doubled as the owner/manager?) had really dry humor and pined himself on being a smart-ass, which I really didn't mind too much at first.  After placing our order, we sat down and waited for our food.  The food took a little over 20 minutes to come out so luckily I wasn't too hungry haha!  The regular tacos (I had vegetarian ones and a fish one as well) were actually pretty good but the vegan taco I has was less than alright (I tried the 'adobo' vegan taco to be specific..just didn't taste right).  The smart-ass manager kept pestering us while we ate as well and started using obscenities to supplement his sarcasm.  Now, had I been by myself, I wouldn't have minded it too much and probably would have joined in on the sarcasm.  But, he started cursing at my fiance and told her to "sit your ass down and stop f&*%ing moving around damnit" when she went to switch seats on our table to get out of the sunlight.  What's up with that?  Sure we're students, but jesting us with condescending quips all night isn't really what we wanted to hear especially when we we nowhere near rude or sarcastic.  Definitely didn't appreciate the vulgarities and talking that way probably is the reason why there was no one there (on a friday night nonetheless).  The food was pretty good and I appreciated the student special, but being told 'F%$k you' all night long, even if it was a stale attempt at humor, definitely weaned away my chances from returning to eat there again.   2 stars for the good food and the less-than-welcoming attitude.
8	5	0	0	0	Live music. Over 100 different kinds of tequila. Killer beer selection with prices that beat the Frog. Awesome frakkin tacos and chili. Its all at Yayo Taco across from the university! Its the best place you either haven't been to yet or haven't gone to enough! Diversity is the theme and it works all day everyday (except most sundays of course).
8	4	0	1	1	The bf came here first and brought me in a couple nights later to try some stuff out.  ... A cool spot to chill and get a bucket of beer or tequila- we just ordered a few tacos and people watched. This place reminded me of a lot of cool hangouts in California next to the beach. ...  ... The tacos range in price from 1.50 to 2 bucks each, I ordered 3. One was the Bombay which is a sweet curry flavored filling.  ...  ... The other was called shanghai- beef with black bean sauce and some Asian slaw.  ...  ... The last was the ranchero- a BBQ pork and bean taco. All were good and easy to eat, although the quality of the beef in the shanghai taco was not as great as the others for some reason. ...  ...  We were very full after those tacos so I can't imagine eating a whole student special which is 4 tacos, rice, and beans. Good deal for some different types of tacos. ...   ... Management is pretty kick back, I would assume you have to be if your taco shop is across from a college campus.
8	1	2	2	1	I've given this place so many chances and it always lets me down.  ...  ... The place looks cool and the live music is great.. but the food blows! They need to revise the menu and focus on a few menu items and actually give them some flavor. The food always takes way too long ( Tacos should not take longer than 15 minutes) and they are always COLD. ...  ... YAYO BLOWS!
8	2	1	2	1	Yayo, your ideas are excellent. But after a few more visits I've determined you are really hit or miss. Go for a bucket of beer and chill out to some music. The owner makes it a point to host local music artists so I can dig that. I'm just really not a fan food-wise. Great vegetarian options, but I am not a vegetarian and have ordered a few different tacos; some were mediocre others I will stay far away from. I also ordered the carne asada fries and the fries were soggy, and overall re-warmed tasting. I have the same problem with the meat, not so fresh. I really want to love yayo's food just as much as I love the intention and atmosphere and booze selection, but I just can't bring myself to continue exploring the menu.
8	5	5	8	6	This place is so much fun and laid-back, I absolutely adore it. You feel like you're actually in another country for awhile. The decor totally sets the mood with the wooden benches and tables that have writing all over them. Very fun.  ...  ... But the food at a practical steal is why I always keep coming back here. During happy hour for UNLV/CSN students from 5-7 PM and 10-11 PM, you can get 4 classic tacos, 2 sides, and a can of soda for $5. Otherwise, this combo is $7.25 which is still a great deal because by the end of your meal they should guarantee that your button will pop off your pants or you get it free. I didn't even finish one of my tacos and I still felt like I wanted to die, but in a good way. I am getting full just thinking about it. ...  ... I went with my boyfriend who also got the combo, his with meat and I went veg of course. I got three veggie tacos off of the classic menu, and then paid 50 cents extra for my last taco to be a Tofu Adobo taco. Unfortunately I can't tell you what was in the latter taco because I devoured it so damn fast. But the other veggie tacos are always made fresh and to perfection. Onion, peppers, zucchini with some crazy orange sauce that gives it a little kick. SO good. Unfortunately my sweet potato fries were a bit lacking on this visit, but the black beans with onion and garlic are always delicious.  ...  ... As I was perusing the menu with my honey, I noticed that they had something amazing at the bottom: homemade flan. I grew up on my grandfather's flan so I had to have it. Let's just say this wasn't my grandpa's flan. It had seeds on the top, and came with chips. Strange, but it was love at first bite. Order that with a Mexican Coke and you will have sugar rush like no other. You'll also probably want to throw up in the parking lot for the amount of food eaten, but I tell you it will be worth it.  ...  ... This place is very casual, the service is always good, and the food is beyond delicious. Of course sometimes the tacos are hit or miss, so I suggest to get 4 completely different ones with your meal and see which ones you like. But this place gets 5 stars because it's a comfortable experience at a great price, you get a ton of good (veg*n friendly!) food and hell - they recycle! Come in on a night when they have live bands playing and it is a total blast.
8	4	0	2	2	This is one of the few places that I've found in the UNLV area that has decent vegan options.  They have 4 tacos that can be made vegan (ask for the tofu ones w/ out the crema sauces), and these toppings can also be put into a burrito.  They have several vegan side items (black beans, plantain chips-YUM, sweet potato fries, and even a quinoa salad).  If you're a UNLV student/staff member, the 4 tacos, 2 sides + drink for $5 is an awesome deal.  For the omnivores, the nachos look like a super deal -- a giant pile of chips and goodies for like $4.50.  Beware on the vegan tacos -- these can be SUPER greasy sometimes. Still tasty, but a little gross.   ... They also have a huge selection of microbrews and high gravity beers in addition to a large selection of tequilas.
8	3	0	0	0	Kind of a local version of the Pink Taco. Gourmet take on the taco shop with a large tequila and beer selection. Would give it four stars but the food prep takes way too long especially for someone in for a quick lunch.
8	3	0	0	0	This place opened right around the time that the House of Brews shut down. So the UNLV Allstars came here and started things off with some beer called 1776 (I think). Anyhow, I found it odd the owners let us write on the walls in marker and whatever we had available (blood?) But whatever.  ...  ... They have some pretty good tacos though. I thinkt he place is usually a little pricey. But, if you're looking for beer, somewhere to sit, and relax a little, this is the place.
8	4	0	0	0	Vegas, Vegas, Vegas. At some point in the last 5 or 10 years with the growth of the food celebrity industry and everyone becoming acquainted with terms like truffle oil, amuse bouche, and chevre, Vegas became a hub for Michelin stars. Most of this of course happened along the strip in the newer, or newly remodeled, hotels, so when you go to Vegas you should expect to spend lots of money on gambling, bottle service, and restaurants in a ridiculously tiny stretch of land. That is why I was surprised that apparently there is good food to be had off the strip too, and in this particular instance, in a place called Yayo Taco. ...  ... Ambiance (4): It's across from UNLV so its ramshackle environ is perfect for the location. It reminds me of a beach shack that you expect surfers to frequent, with lots of writing and graffiti on the walls and artsy items here and there that you expect to find in up and coming art districts frequented by hipsters. The no fuss shack setup compliments the simple yet great tacos. ...  ... Food (4): I love true tacos. What do I consider true tacos? Five ingredients or less served in double small corn tortillas. No hard shells, no shredded cheddar. They had a selection of about a dozen tacos. Half were classics like carnitas while the others were more adventurous like green chicken curry or Texas bbq, which in fight were two of the ones I tried. The green chicken curry was especially good with a tamarind chutney that said ''hello old friend'' as I chomped down on it (I loved tamarind juice as a kid although I did not like the fruit itself). On the classics side I had carnitas and al pastor and they were great. Not as good as my favorite spot in San Francisco, but definitely good and all of the above tacos stuck to the five ingredient parameter. There are other items on the menu like quesadillas and burritos, but I did not try those and frankly, it'd be a waste to...unless you are one of those burrito fanatics I guess. The side dishes are ok and vary in quality. One day I had pretty good rice and the next day not so much. Skip the sides. ...  ... To top it all off, Yayo has an impressive list of tequilas and beer. I am talking about what appeared to be like 100 beers easily. How they prevent the less popular ones from getting skunky, I have no clue. Maybe the UNLV students have a very varied palette and cycle through all the inventory in a timely manner. Bottomline: impressive drink selection. ...  ... Service (4): Friendly and down to earth staff. You can order and sit down or sit down and order and either way they will come over to your table and be attentive to your needs.   ...  ... Value (4): If you are an UNLV student you would be crazy not to eat here a few times a week. The price per taco is good and they have a good combo meal that will definitely fill you up with tacos and sides. ...  ... Overall: This place is awesome for the value and the food (in that order). I was impressed and I am bound to go back next time I am in town for work and have a rental car at my disposal. I wish I had had a place like that back when I was in college; I would have consumed a lot less Lipton's Noodles & Sauce (99 cent special) and Pizza Hut Express breadsticks (1.49).
8	3	1	3	2	Wow am I efficient or what? I literally just got back from lunch at Yayo today and am already here typing my notes up! I am quite proud of myself.  ...  ... So I decided to try this place out the moment I read reviews about it having TOFU TACOS. Not one or two but THREE tofu tacos on their menu. Now, tofu on anything is my weakness. I just adore tofu...soft, firm, fried, baked...ANYWAY....some people may gag at the mere mention of tofu but I salivate.  ...  ... The fact that Yayos had tofu tacos was enough to make me drive 30 min in the 110 degree weather on a weekday for my tofu fix. From this lengthy introduction you can tell that I REALLY wanted to like Yayo.  ...  ... I went with 2 friends (one veggie and one omnivore). All of us ordered the special : 4 tacos, 2 sides and a drink for $8 ($5 for UNLV card holders and $.50 extra per specialty taco...the tofu tacos are specialty tacos). My plate came with: ...  ... 1. Tofu Nuez Taco (x2) ... 2. Tofu Adobo Taco ... 3. Tofu Fuma Taco ...  ... General consensus on tacos: I don't like corn tortillas and these guys don't have an option of flour. So I concentrated on eating the insides. The sauces were pretty good and the tofu seemed like fried tofu puffs. It was actually good. My only complaints are that the quantity of tofu was pretty small and all the tacos tasted pretty much the same. So I had 4 tacos that tasted like each other.  ...  ... 4. Sweet Potato Fries - seemed burnt. But I will devour all fries nevertheles ...  ... 5. Black Beans - Umm...not much to say. Tasted like black beans.  ...  ... The place itself was pretty cool - definitely geared towards the college crowd so it brought back some fun memories. The people at the counter were friendly. I'd probably come back again just because getting any sort of vegetarian Mexican food is pretty tough so I'm gonna take what I get.  ...  ... Yayo has the potential to be so much better. I don't mind if they charged me more to fill up the tacos a bit more and offered flour tortillas.
8	4	1	2	1	I like this place! Its a cute little dive joint thats open late (1am wed-sat) and sometimes has a band playing. A lot of UNLV students hang out here and it has a laid back easy going atmosphere. ...  ... If there is a band it can be very loud inside but I like the picnic table seating outside anyways on nice summer nights. ...  ... They have 4 vegetarian or vegan options... Plain veggies, veggies and tofu (Nuez), bbq style tofu (Fuma) and a wasabi type tofu. ... The first time we went we did the 4 taco special and tried all the vegetarian tacos. My favorite is the Fuma. ...  ... We went again last week and I ordered a "veggie plate." Fuma tofu and veggies (just the filling, no corn tortilla), quinoa salad side and garlic onion pepper black bean side. It came out great all on a plate and was a good portion for me when Im trying to be low carb. ...  ... My husband ordered the fuma style burrito and I snuck a bite (yummy!). He also got a Yayo snow ball which is a small ice cream ball rolled in yummy crispy ingredients. Its small... like a ping pong ball. ... The plantain chips and black bean dip is also good. The black bean dip is different from the garlic onion pepper black bean side. They add sugar and maybe something else cuz its sweet and more creamy. ... Lots of beer and tequila choices...And the prices are reasonable! Will be back :)
8	4	0	0	0	I went this Monday evening and it was a delight! This was my second time to this establishment Yayo Taco was offering FREE live jazz music to it's patrons. A excellent jazz quintet formed by UNLV alumni were showcasing their talent. It was superb! I have never seen such great talent. The musicians were engaging and amazing in their craft. This talent would give any generic Vegas jazz show a run for their money- easily, It is all free, every Monday night starting at 9pm.  ...  ... Bring your date or go with some friends. The wait staff are very friendly and caring. Miguel and his wife work the counter daily I discovered  ... The food is a good value. For less than 8 dollars you can get a great meal of Tacos with sides and a fine Mexican beer or soda in a glass bottle. "Hecho en Mexico"  ...  ... This is a good value. I caution those who expect 5-star food ingredients in the preparation. The quality of the meats are fair, thus offering better than expected prices. Of course, if they used expensive ingredients, it would be more expensive to you!  ...  ... "Que viva Monday jazz nights en Yayo Taco!" The chips and salsa are cheap and delicious.
8	5	3	3	3	I like to refer to Cho, the owner and Chef, as my favorite anomaly. He's of Chinese descent, cooks Mexican Cuisine, and plays country music. He's likes for his spot to be incognito- and if you get there early enough, you'll have a chance to maybe take a shot of tequila with him! ...  ... There is years of world-travelled-surfer, inspired food here. He's soaked up recipes from all over Indonesia and Australia as well many other countries and this knowledge and love for food truely shows up in his cooking. ...  ... Weather it's the insane TOFU NUEZ tacos, which even a tofu hater will surley love or the CHICKEN MOLE tacos with 21 ingredients in the sauce alone, or the 100 different Tequilas and 100 species of brew... ...  ... ANYTIME I'm on the east side...I make it a point to come here. To call it a taco shop is a gross understatement.  ...  ... Love this place.
8	3	0	0	0	This is a funky, college hangout that serves small, but very tasty street tacos. We shared a platter of pollo, carnitas and (2) pastor tacos.
8	2	1	2	1	The food wasn't too bad, the experience really wasn't that great though.  The nachos were pretty good, as were the carnitas tacos.  The pastor tacos were sort of blah, of course I ate all of them but I wouldn't order them again.  Maybe I'm making an unfair comparison, the last time I had tacos al pastor was in Mexico. ...  ... We went to check out the happy hour, although the guy at the counter couldn't tell us what was going on for happy hour and couldn't tell us how much the beers were and didn't give us a receipt.  Seriously?  He was happy to take my $20 though. ...  ... The place is tucked away behind Cafe Rio, you'd really have to be looking for it to notice it.  Most of the walls of covered in teenage scrawling similar to Rebel Pizza.  I think most would agree that it really looks like crap.  Even the seats are covered in marker, I wouldn't wear light colored pants if I were you. ...  ... The best thing about Yayo?  The beer and tequila selection is extensive!
8	3	0	0	0	cheap, quick and the tacos are pretty alright.
8	3	0	1	1	This place is only open during certain hours, and the service is great, but the flavor for the tacos isn't all that great.  I've had better tacos, but if you're looking for a good price and you're a student.....then I guess you should check this place out.  Show your UNLV rebel card and get the student special for $5.67.  It comes with a drink, 2 sides, and four tacos.  The sides are delicious, but if you're considering the tacos get the beer battered shrimp sicilian style.  It's more flavorful than the others.
8	4	1	3	4	I had no idea yayo taco existed before today.  Too bad, I would have eaten many a lunch there, it's the perfect place for a quick tasty bite with much more diversity than your typical taco shop.   ...  ... First, if you're a UNLV student or staff you have no excuse not to try yayo.  It's right by campus, and they have a $5 special now where you can get four tacos (pick and choose from their classic menu - add $0.50 each for the speciality tacos), plus two sides, plus a canned soda!  Holy crap, that's cheap!  And it's good...   If you're not a UNLV associate, prices are still affordable - 1.75 or 2.25 per taco plus some combination specials. ...  ... I went the veggie route and tried the traditional veggie, the tofu adobo (wasabi cream and adobo sauce), the tofu fuma (barbecue veggie and tofu), and a fried fish taco (California style - with crema fresca, guac, and cabbage slaw).  When I return, I'd like to try other menu items, but I'm definitely repeating the veggie and the fish taco.  The veggie taco was actually my favorite.  Instead of the usual "veggie" mix of blandly sauteed bell peppers and onions they actually use peppers with flavor - woah.  I'm assuming the pepper strips were poblano peppers, or an equivalent, they have just a hint of heat with lots of flavor.  The taco is topped with a roasted pepper crema - yum... Others at my table agreed that most of the tofu tacos were kind of "meh".  Their ideas of the flavor blends have great potential, but the execution seems to be a bit off - too much sauce, not enough 'fu.  Still worth a try once because the flavors can be interesting.   ...  ... For sides I got the quinoa salad - decent enough though a tad bland (I still appreciate that it's even on the menu), and the sweet potato fries (which were also "ok").  Next time I'm going for the plantain "chips" which are actually fresh pan fried plantains - I stole more than a couple off my friend's plate. YUM! ...  ... As an earlier reviewer said - they do this authentic style, corn tortillas only.  If you want a flour tortilla for your taco - this is not the place for you.   ...  ... Stop by and give this place a try!
8	4	1	3	2	This place exceeded my expectations. I've known about Yayo for the last couple years, and had seen a show or two there, but never had I eaten there. This changed about 3 weeks ago, when a friend of mine who had recently moved from Las Vegas came back for a visit and wanted to hit it up while she was in town.  ...  ... I've read the reviews about Yayo having some amazing Veg friendly tacos. Little did i know that the ones I had would blow my mind. I had the UNLV lunch special ($5.00 with four tacos,two sides and a drink !?!) I had the only veggie tacos on the special menu, but thoroughly enjoyed them. I had a side of black beans and chips. The corn tortillas were perfect, not greasy at all. The veggies were cooked very well, and the sauce was a nice topping to the tacos.  ...  ... I always knew this place was good for a show, but now I have one more great, cheap lunch spot. I also want to come back as they had a pretty decent beer selection with a variety of micros and imports that I've not seen many places.
8	4	1	1	1	Sometimes being pescetarian sucks when you are out drinking and need that lil something that could be the defining line between sobering up and making it home with both shoes and dignity, or, well..not. This place is great, happy hour dollar beers and great shrimp tacos...love!!Maybe it is just Wednesday night but I did not see anyone there old enough to drink, so this isn't a bar is it? The ratio of guys to girls was 11:1. Usually I'd be all over that if it didn't include a statutory rape case. Other than that I want to go back here like now. I definitely think I will be a regular here!
8	4	0	3	1	The food is awesome here, we booked shows here many times and that is what drew me there. The carnasada burrito is huge and they have one of the largest selections of tequila I have ever seen. My only complaint is not the food, it is only that we have to supply our own sound man(: "PAN"
8	5	0	0	0	For reasons I can't repeat that have nothing to do with the food, YAYO is AMAZING.
8	3	0	0	0	We each ordered a pair of al pastor tacos topped with cilantro, pineapple and onion with a squeeze of lime plus taco chips and black beans. The weather was so pleasant we ended up dining on the patio.  I would rate our meal 3.5 Stars.
8	3	0	1	1	3.5 stars. Yayo Taco is more than just your average taqueria, and it's another reason to venture outside the student union when it comes to dining. The vibe definitely caters to the college and happy hour crowd. They have an awesome UNLV and CSN special: 4 classic tacos, 2 sides, and a drink for $5. Their list of beers and tequila is surprisingly quite long. A perfect pair with these delicious tacos. I liked that it had fusion tacos that was influenced by different cultures. My personal favorite is the Bombay taco. It's a roasted chicken taco with green curry and mint. If you have a sense of trepidation, no fear, they have the usual carne asada, pollo, carnitas, and fish tacos. Vegetarians are catered as well, offering veggie and tofu tacos. So you can totally bring your hippie-Trader Joe loving friend. ...  ... Downside? I hate to say it, but their sides disappointed me. I liked that they offered different side dishes such as salad and quinoa, but my sweet potato fries were thin and overcooked. My quinoa salad was tasty and had good texture, but it saddened me that the portion was kinda small. I should have stuck to beans and chips. Wait time kinda felt long: 25 minutes. It was probably because of the family ahead of me ordered a feast. ...  ... Interior decor might cause split opinion. It doesn't have that slick and shiny look of Chipotle, but it has character, which I totally appreciate. The people working were very friendly and offered me their special hot sauce, which did not disappoint. One of the workers, Alejandro, was very cool. He told me about jazz nights and let me take some menus.(Which I will post). Nice staff (called me by my first name) and good tacos made me a fan. Now only if they improved those sweet potato fries.
8	2	16	15	8	Like approaching the gorgeous woman across the bar, only to learn she smells like body odor and Doritos. ...  ... Like buying the vacation package that looked perfect online, just to find your "luxury cruise" is really a mattress on the floor of a fishing barge.  ...  ... Like buying a car off Craigslist, driving it 2 blocks and having all four wheels fall off. ...  ... Such is Yayo Taco, looking mighty good up front and turning out to be something completely different in the end. Do you know how excited I was to hear they had a slew of vegetarian/vegan tacos? I guess no, you wouldn't know how excited I was so I'll tell you: SUPER FUCKING EXCITED. We went here on purpose a few miles from our hotel just to rock their veggie tacos. Multiple tofu options, from BBQ to veggie and tofu, different sauces... promising stuff. They looked amazing on paper and when they got in front of me on the plate I almost freaked out they looked so good. I was buzzed, 'tis Vegas after all, and when I saw that sexy plate'o'tacos I got ready to regulate. Booze and tacos man, best there is. ...  ... So I took a bite. And another bite. One more bite just to confirm, and yea, totally boring. Waaaaay boring. Ultra-mega-super-compound-massive boring. Hopefully I made that clear enough, BORING. So I ate all three of my tacos, each one different, each one differently boring. Finding food boring when you're drunk is hard to do which makes me even more sad. ...  ... Maybe the meat ones are the shit, I dunno, but I can 100% vouch that the vegan options are not. One extra star because the lady working the counter was sweet and also simply for having some vegetarian/vegan items in the first place. They were healthy and had very fresh ingredients, just a damn shame the tacos had no flavor. *sigh*
8	4	0	1	1	I'm Vegan and my girlfriend isn't. We were able to order easily off of the menu AND absolutely L-O-V-E-D the tacos. The plantain chips were good and I was grateful they weren't already salted. ...  ... The beer and spirits menu was infinite. I must go back to try some. Great prices for the quality and flavor. The atmosphere is young, fun and LOUD so don't go here unless you're ok almost shouting at each other indoors. ...  ... I recommend #13 Tofu Nuez on the menu...DIVINE!
8	3	0	0	0	Great food and margarita as noted by others. Super slow service - got our margaritas after our food was already out! Great prices, I'd consider going there again if I was near UNLV.
8	5	0	0	0	I've been to Yayo taco twice and they have yet to disappoint!  If you are brave and love flavor... take your pick off the loco taco list.  Amazing fusion of flavors in a small street taco!  Affordable and Delicious!  The Sicilian is my new favorite!
8	5	0	0	0	Yayo is amazing. The food is good and the vibe is awesome. Its really a college student hangout. If you don't like the live music which is on often, take your food to go. There is no reason for you being here obviously so just take your grub to go. Most of the shows are local underground shows, and they often play a lot of punk stuff too, so the selection isn't really to most peoples taste. But I love it.
8	4	0	0	0	Since my last review, I've been here quite often, so much that they know me on a first name basis. Which I kind of admire, because rarely (especially in Vegas) do I find owners make that effort. That deserves some recognition, right? That aside, I must say, their veggie taco has improved. No longer are the veggies slathered in oil, but it's sauteed enough to keep it firm and tasty. And it's topped with this curry like sauce, which is delicious. They offer plenty of outdoor seating when weather permits. So if you're near or at UNLV, make that trek, stop in, listen to great music, and enjoy a taco and brewski (preferably Sierra Nevada Pale Ale).
8	5	0	2	0	The food here is great, a blend of Mexican dishes with spices from all over the world.  I get the taco combo special with 4 tacos and 2 side dishes.  The sides are just as great as the main dishes with plantain chips and sweet potato fries being my favorites.  They also have a lot of vegetarian and vegan friendly dishes if that's your thing.   ...  ... Don't forget the huge selection of micro brews and tequilas!
8	4	1	1	1	good beer!! ...  ... food meh!? ...  ... awesome beer selection. ... Sicilian tacos are the best ive had on their menu so far.
8	2	1	2	2	My husband and I stopped for the Adopt A Rescue Pet Bullies and Brews fund raising event that was being hosted at Yayo Taco. I was excited about getting to try out a new place to eat while also getting to help animals in need. Sadly, Yayo Taco isn't on my list of places to hurry back to...  ...  ... The guy that took our order could have used an attitude adjustment. I get it, you are working on a Saturday, sucks to be you..  Still would be nice if you smiled and perhaps offered us glasses for the beers we just ordered... Or at the very least not acted like you were doing us a favor by getting them when requested. The person that brought out our food was much more pleasant.  ...  ... My husband ordered the chicken burrito, I went with 2 carne asada tacos, and two sides... People that know my eating habits know I loveloveLOVE sweet potatoes in almost any form, particularly sweet potato fries. So the sweet potato fries were a must try, and I also had an order of plantain chips.  ...  ... I am spoiled when it comes to carne asada and while these tacos were ok, I have certainly had a lot better. The meat was cut into large chunks and it was a lot wetter then I am used to but there was a lot of it for the size of the tacos. A couple pieces had more fat/gristle then I like to eat. My sweet potato fries were disappointing, super thin and burnt tasting. The plantain chips were the highlight of my meal, so good I was tempted to get a second serving. ...  ... My husband only ate about half of his burrito, mainly because he was starving. The veggies in his burrito were tasty but the overly sweet chicken seasoning ruined it for him. Perhaps he would have been happier with something else on the menu?  ...  ... If I was a student at UNLV I would probably give Yayo Taco another shot and try some different items off the menu... The prices were quite reasonable and the selection of beers was great. I can't see myself driving across town for these tacos again though, unless of course there is another dog rescue fund raiser being held here...
8	3	0	1	0	I've been going to UNLV for four years, and have never once tried this place. Finally, a friend of mine told me he was performing there so I decided to give it a try. I was excited when I first walked in because of their awesome student special. $5 gets you four tacos, 2 sides, & a drink. It's a great deal and fills your tummy enough so you aren't longing for more food. The taste of the tacos, however, didn't live up to expectations. The tacos were mediocre.  ...  ... They have a pretty extensive beer selection which made me happy. The prices on those beers however were overpriced. I understand paying more for beers that most other places don't carry, but I thought their prices were a little too steep.  ...  ... They have local singers and what not play there, so if you go on a good night - you at least get some free entertainment with your meal.
8	3	0	0	0	This place is alright.  While the 5 dollar student special is certainly a good deal for the amount of food you get, this is a case where it's quantity over quality.  The tacos are okay.  The fish taco and the shrimp tacos are good (which, btw, is a problem, since they charge you more to have these items, defeating the point of the student special), but I've tried so very hard to like the carne asada and the various chicken tacos they have on their menu, and I just am not into it.  The sauces that they use for both their carne asada and their chicken tacos is kinda nasty.  The steak is generally greasy, and there's just something off about it.  I always tell them easy on the sauce now, which makes it better, but they are definitely not my favorite tacos. ...  ... Their sides are pretty good.  I like their black beans and the rice.  Their fries are also good.  However, their sweet potato fries are freakin' nasty.  And I've gone there several times to be told that the rice "isn't ready".  Who the hell has a taco place and doesn't have rice?!?  Really, people.  Plus, if it's lunchtime, your rice should probably be ready. ...  ... Howeverrrr.... All of this said, I'm kind of squeamish about eating there now, since this place was on dirty dining somewhat recently.  :-/
8	4	0	0	0	$1 beer for the ladies on Wednesday...can't beat that!  The nachos are the best I've had in Vegas!  Smoking outside only.  The chairs are not particularly comfortable, but with drop down roll shades, it's a pleasant outdoor area, especially if cruising with a pooch.  The decor is pretty cool and I dig the genderless and spacious bathrooms.  Only draw back: the place is a magnet for hipsters.  You definitely have to make room for the hairdos and shoe gazers, which for some may actually be a plus!
8	2	1	2	1	I really wanted to like this place...they have great prices, it's close to campus and where I live, It can be fun place to get some beers, BUT the food sucked! I ordered the student special with tacos, sweet potato fries, and black beans. To put it simply, everything lacked flavor, the tacos were very inauthentic, overdressed with sauces and sour cream to hide the blandness of the protein. Surprisingly even the fries and beans sucked. I gave it an extra star because it's a decent watering hole for some late night cervezas.
8	3	2	5	1	Yayo Taco needs an intervention.... ... As someone else has already said, "I really wanted to like this place." ...  ... The amazing decor reminiscent of an open air snack shack on a tijuana beach, the counter style service, the PRICES, the great background music selection, the LIVE music, the beer selection...I could keep going.  ... If these were the only factors this would be my go to spot any time I was in the UNLV neighborhood. ... But... ... The food... ... This is a classic example of a place trying to do too much with a simple concept, and doing it poorly. ...  ... The $5 student combo is one of the best food values in all of vegas. ... 4 tacos 2 sides & a drink. Unfortunately I couldn't finish a single taco. I wanted to get a nice sampling so I got 4 different tacos and after a single bit of each I kept hoping the next would be better.  ... But it wasn't. ... They have great intent but poor execution ... The tacos are small but LOADED with meat, but the meet is in large chunks that aren't really conducive to tacos, the seasoning and sauces are poured onto the meat rather than slow cooked into the meat, and there is just too much going on with each item and there is no balance. ... Ask anyone who knows me...for me to not finish a taco there has to be something very wrong with it. ... Also, a warning, the drink that comes with the meal is a can of soda...so don't drink too much of it if you decide to sample the habanero hot sauce on the tacos. ...  ... My advice: ... Go ... Drink ... Hang Out ... Listen to Music ... but skip the food.
8	3	0	0	0	As a UNLV student, this place has one of the best deals around. 5 tacos, 2 sides and a drink for $5, and the tacos are really good.  They are traditional street tacos, so on the smaller side, but they don't skimp you on the meat.  It's a fun place to go with friends, get a bucket of beers, and sit around and chat.  It's order at the counter, and they'll call your number when your food is ready.  I think that they also have either live music or a DJ on some nights, usually Latin themed, shocking, I know...
8	5	0	0	0	Beer selection amazing. One of the best dive bars in vegas see for yourself. Carnitas tacos a 10!
8	4	1	1	1	YAY for YAYO!!!  What a fantastic surprise this place was.  Totally laid back atmosphere, great seating options inside & out and friendly staff.  I have only been here once but am planning on going back on Friday.  Mmm Mmmm so good!  They have some really interesting Taco choices from the #10 which is a chicken curry taco...( It was SO GOOD!)! the Fish Tacos, Shrimp, Tofu, Veggie, they have one with a spicy peanut sauce... the options were aplenty! I cant wait to go back!  Super easy on your wallet too!!  Definitely worth a stop in.  This is not fine dining by any stretch of the imagination but this is just good food at a great price with a great selection.  And I was REALLY surprised at how much meat was in the tacos.  They truly dont skimp! The Quinoa is a yummy side dish as well as the black beans.  My daughter had the sweet potato fries and loved them too!  My one word of caution would be not to go here expecting your traditional Carne Asada or Chicken Taco's.  I was really surprised by my carne asada taco as it seemed more like a roasted beef or pulled beef taco than the steak I am used to.  It was still good, just not what I was expecting.  Just come expecting to try something different in a graffiti saturated super chill place.  I only wish it were closer to home!
8	5	0	1	0	Awesome atmosphere, great people and unique and delicious food are why this is one of my favorites. Throw in the taco special, live music and the fact you can bring your pup and this place is as perfect as it gets in Vegas. Closed Sundays btw...but that's OK cause they deserve a break!
8	4	0	0	0	Tried this place for lunch.... They had some pretty good vegan options. The veggie tacos were good and creatively put together, with the veggies marinated in coconut milk. It was a little sweet for my liking, but still pretty flavorful. The only thing I would've liked was some vegan cheese or some vegan sour cream to go with them. Aside from that, the place itself was pretty cool too. It was a little divey, but the music in there was good, service was fast and there was a lot to look at on the walls.
8	4	0	2	0	Good evening my fellow yelpers! ...  ... It has been a while and I've had many good eats within the time that I've been away and now it's time to clean out my backlog of unfinished reviews so let's cut straight to the chase shall we? ...  ... One of the best places to eat in the UNLV area goes by the name of Yayo Taco. It is walking distance from the student union and everything they have to offer is affordable in terms of a college student's budget. ...  ... The venue is a pretty chill place. It definitely has that hole in the wall feel and there's no mistaking that this is a locals joint because it has that family feel to it when you're just hanging out. Yayo holds frequent events and they have local bands come out to play in the venue and they're always a blast but the best thing about this place is that they cater to the students. ...  ... Yayo is best known for having a student deal available not only to the students of UNLV, but to the students of CSN as well. This deal includes your choice of 2 sides, 4 tacos classicos, and a drink. There are quite a few sides but I like to get sweet potato fries and a side of nachos. They have a great variety of tacos and I LOVE LOVE LOVE the beer battered camarrones (shrimp) tacos. SOOOO GOOD. One more little perk about Yayo is their wide selection of beer.. and they have a WIDE selection. ...  ... Overall Yayo Taco is a must for any UNLV student looking to grab a bite to eat while keeping your wallet alive.  ...  ... As for the out of townies.. if you're visiting a UNLV buddy.. go here.. if not.. LOCALS ONLY! :P
8	4	0	1	1	It's hard for me whether to give this place three or four stars. My coworker's son had their band play here the night I was there. Upon first impression I wasn't entirely impressed, and to be honest the music really wasn't my scene. However, you can't beat what you get for the student special they have: your choice of 4 tacos (you can pick through items 1-5 on the menu), two sides (there's a good list of them), and drink (and the best part is tequila, margaritas, and beer is also added to this!!!) ...  ... I had the veggie tacos with rice, chips and salsa, and beer for my meal. The veggie tacos are actually pretty decent for what you get. The chips and salsa were a little small than usual, and the rice was A-OK. I enjoyed having my beer be part of the bill with my meal, which was $7 in total for *everything* I got (and honestly you really can't beat a deal like that). Did I mention they have a ridiculous selection of beers to choose from?! For a little hole in the wall taco shop like this, you're going to be caught off guard with how many selections they have! ...  ... While I found this place to be four stars at best (maybe even 3.5 if there was an option), I have to say the music scene here is 3 stars at best. I think its because the music is not really my scene (high school ska-ish rock), but I'll have to swing by here before the bands are headlining to enjoy the student special a little more.
8	4	1	1	1	I live around the corner, so Yayo is one of our frequent walk-to places.  I would have said the artisan tacos are 3-4 stars, but I recently discovered the nachos - which rocketed my rating up to 5 stars.  The chips stay crunchy and look like they're made in-house instead of dumped from a bag.  Ground beef #2 is my favorite! ...  ... Two things annoy me however ... When I asked what comes on the $4.50 nachos, the cashier listed of a ton of stuff (cheese, tomatoes, lettuce, rice, guac, black or pinto beans, and your choice of taco meat, etc) so I said, "Cool -- I'll take everything!" and my bill came to $8.  He didn't say all that stuff was additional cost!  *frown*  It tasted great, so I got over it. ...  ... Second, the $5 student lunch special is jive since I bring friends there all the time and we deserve a cheap lunch too.  Why do non-students have to pay an extra $2.50 for lunch?  I don't like being discriminated against cuz I already graduated.  :-P
8	5	0	0	0	Fabulous service....and great atmosphere. Will come back again...and again.
8	5	0	0	0	Great selection of veggie tacos as well as meat tacos with very creative sauces. The prices are awesome as well as the service. Adrian was particularly helpful. I like grunge-style decor too. A great place to satisfy vegetarians and carnivores.
8	5	0	0	0	Awesome food! Tacos are filled super full!
8	4	0	0	0	Great tacos! Ordered 6 Carne Asada tacos. They were packed with meat, onions and cilantro and had great flavor. Awesome staff, very friendly. My wife and I had long conversations with the Owner and Cook on how they make their food. Had a great time watching local Metal acts. When I am in Vegas, I am always looking for places not on the strip to eat. I will definitely be revisiting Yayo Taco when I come back.
8	3	0	0	0	I have alot of friends who live on campus, so yayo is a staple in our weekend routine. food is good, beer is good, its a great place to sit and drink and listen to local talent play thier music. the atmosphere is cozy and hip, but sometimes the other patrons can be a downer. the quinticential college hipster with the fake wayfarers sit outside drinking pbr and smoking cigarettes looking down thier noses at me and my friends can get on some peoples nerves. the staff is funny and friendly and always accomedating.  overall, fun place to hang out, dont let the other patrons ruin your good time here at yayo.
8	5	0	0	0	The Tacos are AMAZING and so are the chips and fries.  The atmosphere is laid back.
8	4	0	1	0	I absolutely love coming here. I am a vegetarian and I crave for their tofu tacos. My faves are Tofu Nuez and sometimes I cheat and have some Shrimp or FIsh tacos which are also awesome. The Tofu Tacos have these interesting pasty, and spicy, sauces and I always leave the place totally full! For sides I get either the salad, sweet potato fries, the banana thingy..., or quinoa. What a healthy meal!  ...  ... I always get the "rebels" special for being a student from UNLV but to be honest one of those plates (which includes four tacos and two sides) are plenty for two unless you're starving that day! But i must note that for vegetarians, the tofu tacos cost extra.. but still worth the money in my opinion.  ...  ... The place looks kind of empty and most of my friends (who are not vegetarian at all) have never been there, but once i make them try their food they always leave happy.  ...  ... The only thing about this place that stops me from giving 5 stars is that sometimes the service isn't consistent and I do not enjoy the random bands that play there from time to time. But I must say I am very picky and the fact that they support upcoming artists are nice. Just not my cup of tea to be listining to screaming hard metal while i eat my tacos. :)  ...  ... All in all, its a definite place to stop by and try their billion choices of tacos!!
8	4	3	2	1	Here's my big tip about Yayo Taco: Order the fish tacos or the shrimp tacos. Oh and order the ceviche!  ...  ... I guess I happened to luck out by going all seafood the night I ate here. I'm not sure why, it might have had something to do with the fact that I was with my friend who is a vegetarian and I thought getting the fish may offend her less than say a heaping pile of carne asada. I am glad I did though. These tacos were soooo good. They are the perfect size too, so you can order a couple different ones and get a variety. ...  ... The night I went they were hosting a concert with a heavy metal band from Spain. That was really interesting to watch. This place definitely has that "college divey venue" feel. The bathroom is hideous, although not as bad as Double Down. ...  ... My only complaint is the tables are sticky gross. So if you can eat at the bar, it's much more clean. Supposedly there is a student discount for UNLV and CSN students - since I am neither of those things, it holds little consequence to me. I did note while there that some people there were complaining about the pricing here has risen. *shrug* Honestly I think it's pretty spot-on for what you're getting. ...  ... When I go back here I am getting the fish/shrimp tacos and the ceviche. Seriously, their ceviche was delicious! I am picky about my ceviche too because I've grown up on a recipe my father learned to make when he lived in Panama. So if a place can impress me with that, then I am definitely going back!

8	5	0	0	0	One of our favorite places to eat in Vegas! I personally love the tofu tacos, while my brother, friends and spouse go bananas for the shrimp and fish tacos; for our sides we adore the dessert style plantain and sweet potato fries.  ...  ... Very close to UNLV (right across from the student union, so eat here instead of one of the food court corporate locations at the union), and they offer a great meal discount for UNLV student's ($5 for four tacos, two sides and a drink, unless you get a specialty taco). ...  ... The ambiance is great, kinda thrown together post apocalyptic vibe going on. Rough hewn wood benches and patron drawn graffiti/pictures on the walls really make Yayo awesome.
8	5	0	0	0	I LOVE this place! Great staff.great food.great atmosphere!!!!!! Everything is just cooooollll about Yayo's.
8	5	0	0	0	Great food!!! Order the carnitas or Bombay tacos these are great!!!!!!
8	3	0	0	0	I wish Yelp had a 1/2 star option, so I can give three and a half stars! ...  ... My tacos were delicious! Generous amount of guacamole and I loved the beer battered shrimp and pollock fish (crispy on the outside and tender and succulent on the inside). My ceviche was also good.  ...  ... The negatives were the Napa slaw in my fish taco (more vinegary-pickle than slaw) and a third of my chips (that came with my ceviche) were stale and hard.  ...  ... Despite the negatives, I'll give this place another shot.
8	5	0	1	0	Being a chef those are some of the best tacos i have ever had sure i could make them myself but why there great!!  the value is there the flavor is there. I promote them to all my friends ..As a chef i am very picky!! I have crossed off more restaurants lately because of sucky food so Go to YAYO Tacos for some killer grub if you like HOT ask for there Hot creation its smokin so beware..and beer and tequila list is huge
8	5	1	0	0	My first love in las Vegas. Yayo, call me when you start franchising! While i am typically a purist, i Love the taco fusion.
8	5	1	1	0	Flipping love this place!  Try the 4 taco combo...it comes with 4 street tacos of your choice, 2 sides and a drink.  Perfect for 2 people to split.  The whole meal cost about $10.  Really reasonable and the food is SO good!   ...  ... I've tried the Carne Asada...wonderful!  So tender and delicious!  The Texacano is definitely worth trying!  Again, so tender and delicious!  I've also tried their chicken curry option called the Bombay, which was good.  The Pollo is very good too.  Their chips and salsa are so tasty!  The chips and salsa taste and look homemade.  I haven't tried any other sides but am planning on it for my next visit! ...  ... I will without a doubt be back!
8	3	0	0	0	Great value, tastes fresh, but the tacos weren't as flavorful as I thought they looked. It might be from the hype i hears beforehand. I would come back & recommend them though. My 4 taco special was filling & gave me a food coma. Go outside what you know, because the unfamiliar taco choices I picked tastes better than the carne asada tacos. The place is tricky to find because it's behind a building called Rebel Books. They need a sign, but their theme is interesting. Lots of beers and tequila! Try it for yourself!
8	5	3	1	2	If you don't rate this place 5-stars then you haven't actually experienced this place. ...  ... First, I'm a lover of all things beer. Second, I'm a lover of all things Tex-Mex. Third, they got it right all the way down the line. ...  ... I went in first just to have some beers. Adrian (spelling? Ack!) served me and was laid back and didn't say much but was quick on the draw when he saw my beer go low. Thanks! ;) ...  ... I left and then went back again to finish what I started. Whew, bad idea. Sort of. I said I'd need to sleep there after all the beer and food I was about to consume and Adrian so generously offered up a hammock hanging behind me, what a pal! ...  ... I ordered some more beer (Belgian) and told Adrian that I loved all things Belgian. While commiserating with me he asked if I'd ever tried a Japanese beer (I believe) or another Belgian, I believe. I hadn't, but they looked so good that I promised I'd be back to try them again soon. I trust this man implicitly.  ...  ... I asked about food and he highly recommended I try the carne asada tacos. Well, okay! I asked if they made guac and he said they did. I wanted thick and chunky and he said 'whatever you want.' Well, whatever I wanted was exactly what I got.  ...  ... The carne asada had a spicy bite to it, but was still chunky and slightly chewy in the fabulous corn tortillas. I got four and that was almost too much (for like $6 -- with guac!!). I couldn't stop eating the chips they served with my meal. I almost started dunking them in my beer. I'm positive they would have tasted great that way too! ...  ... All I know is that I walked out of that place thinking 'damn, I hope they don't get sick of me because I'm coming back and may never leave.'  ...  ... Whatever you do, ask for Adrian. Great guy. Beer smart, food smart, super awesome smart. I took his advice on everything and he came through with flying colors. You are the best! ...  ... The food, the beer, the atmosphere - don't miss it. Really.
8	5	0	1	1	I was doing a one month rotation at UNLV student wellness center, so I was always looking for a new place to eat and I stumbled upon this place. AD(the cool register guy) helped me out with a selection of some awesome tacos. This place is definitely worth a try, its got taco bells prices but 100x better taste and you can actually see the meat your eating unlike the grounded stuff they call meat at other places. Thanks AD
8	4	0	0	0	Stopped in here for lunch today. ...  ... The place definitely looks like a dive- all the wooden tables and chairs have writing all over. The restaurant was clean, however. They also offer outdoor dining, which can be awkward as people walk through and try to get spare change off of you while you eat. ...  ... The employees there were really nice. This place doesn't appear to be run by Mexican guys- more like white dudes who like to eat really greasy food.  ...  ... The food was good. The chips were delicious and came with fresh pico de gallo. I enjoyed the pinto beans as well, but there was nothing particularly special about them. I tried the carne asada taco, the ground beef taco, the chicken, and the roast pork. The tacos are about 90% meat, which is really awesome if you're into that. They also have vegetarian tacos for those who do not partake. ...  ... The thing about the tacos is that they were really really greasy. Like, dripped down my arm and face greasy. Be forewarned, and use lots of napkins. I also expected the meat to have more flavor. While the meat in all the tacos was perfectly tender, I thought it would be flavored more with spices or sauce. While this allowed me to really taste the flavor of the meat, I do enjoy mexican flavors in my taco meat as well. ...  ... I did not try any of the beers and tequilas. Over all, this place was good. Extremely cheap (5.40 for the student special!), and the food was decent. I enjoyed it very much. I have a feeling this place would even be better if I was drinking- nothing like greasy tacos to soak up tequila!
8	5	1	1	1	LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PLACE, the food is amazing and the service is great!
8	2	0	1	0	The food kinda sucked. No flavor at all. The ceviche was decent.  Prolly tastes better when drunk, but c'mon you can't rely on drunk college kids to support crappy food. Never going back again
8	2	0	2	0	The good things about Yayo Taco are the value and the beer selection.  With the student special I got more food than I could handle.  3 tacos, 2 sides, and a drink; they even let me upgrade my drink to a beer for an upcharge.  The beer selection is awesome too. ...  ... Unfortunately, this restaurant can't be judged at face value.  The food was awful.  I'm talking about tacos that were flavorless, the chips were stale, and their signature salsa and rice was disgusting.   ...  ... This was so disappointing.  Everyone has been telling me how good Yayo's is, the ambiance looks fun, the portions and presentations are good, the service staff was well informed, and the value was amazing.  However all these things are just a faade for really bad food.
8	4	0	0	1	Reminds me of my days in Long Beach Ca, hanging out at "Live Bait" ,  the shops and all the eat spots on 2nd street.  The service knew it's stuff about what to recommend and what to eat. We came for lunch and the food was reasonably priced and delicious! The ambiance was awesome. We decided we wanted to try to come during the evening hours to get our drink and food on and see it then. I will write a new review for the evening hours.
8	1	0	2	0	I wanted to like this place. I walked in and was excited to see what looked like some amazing tacos and what was clearly an awesome beer selection. But after receiving our food, our tacos were bland and flavorless. They needed salt. Something very basic. ...  ... But I was willing to try it again later, because I thought maybe I just didn't order the right thing. But then I tried to buy some beer to take home that night which the guy that originally took our order said would be fine. As I am picking out a beer another guy appears behind me and says "We can't sell that beer." I say "Why not?" "Because it is hard to get and we only have four left." I was understandably confused. "That doesn't make any sense, but alright." I didn't feel like arguing.  ...  ... If they want to save that beer for themselves, fine! But don't have it on display in your cooler for customers to see and then deny them when they want to give you money for it.   ...  ... I was going to come back and try the food again even though it was disappointing. But after the beer incident I will never go back and I was prompted to write a bad review on Yelp.
8	4	3	4	3	It was a pleasure bringing my hungry ass to Yayo taco for lunch last week, as I discovered some jam packed, delicious TACOS. Okay! Where to start?! First, I feel I should highlight this amazing deal: 4 TACOS, 2 SIDES, AND A DRINK FOR $5!! Thats right, FIVE DOLLARS. Thats what I'm talkin about! ...  ... I love that the menu has variety and that they are creative with the food- very basic ingredients- yet creative and colorful. My fave was the shrimp tacos, I did not unfortunately, like the Pescado- the texture was oddly off and no flavor. I took a peak at what some of the other customers were eating and I noticed insanely huge proportions and inappropriate facial expressions that screamed SATISFACTION ;) ...  ... Basic tacos are  $1.75 and Specialty Tacos are $2.25. You'll have a basic selection of burritos, quesadillas, ensaladas, and even "hamburgers" but you're stupid if you go to a Mexican restaurant to eat a hamburger- so try one of their tasty Tortas! :) ...  ... This place is a hole in the wall, but once inside, you have a spacious seating arrangement, limited bar section, and music. The decorations are fun and it almost feels like one of those places you walk into while your walking on the beach board walk. AND staff was friendly :)
8	2	1	3	0	I want to give this place 5 stars so badly because I know a lot of my friends enjoy these tacos and the atmosphere is really awesome (like a modern-day cave with writings all over the wall), but being the picky vegan that I am, I just can't do it. I've had all 4 types of vegan tacos available here and each one tastes almost exactly like the last. The vegetables are greasy and unpleasant and I struggled to find the tofu in most of the tacos. I also ordered the sweet potato fries and they were puny, shriveled remnants of what probably used to look like fries before they were cooked to death.  ... Maybe the tacos with meat are much better, but overall I wouldn't recommend this place to vegetarians.
8	3	0	1	1	I've been to this place more than a few times and I'm surprised I haven't reviewed it yet! Mainly I come here for metal shows and beer, not so much the food lately but this review is not about that! We were in the area Saturday night on my Bday and wanted to stop in for a round and some music!  ...  ... The music tonight was eh, so we mainly chilled out front. You can dine outside as well which is cool. The buckets of beer are priced reasonably, $13 I believe for Dos Equis Amber.  ...  ... We didn't spend much time here after we finished a couple buckets. Overall, it's in a nice location near campus and the strip. The staff is friendly with a HUGE selection of beer and tequila.  ...  ... Check it out...
8	4	1	2	1	Oh, Yayo Taco.  Where have you been all my life? ...  ... I would have never known about this place if it weren't for Yelp (thanks, Yelp!).  Tucked away in a corner of a half-empty shopping plaza with no real sign telling you the name of the place, I would have driven by a thousand times and been none the wiser.  But not this day.  I was informed and ready to get my taco on. ...  ... The reason I was so excited to get here was the rumor that they had vegetarian tacos.  Imagine my surprise when there was not just one, but FOUR tacos on the menu that were veggie-friendly.  No, seriously.  Imagine it.  I'll wait. ...  ... So my husband and I both ordered the combo which includes 4 tacos (I got one of each, of course), two sides, and a drink.  For our sides, we both got chips and salsa, I got the rice, and he got the fries.  While we waited for our food, we found a seat and instantly fell in love. ...  ... This place has a super fun, colorful, dive bar feel that my husband and I loved.  How could you not have a smile on your face when you see a couple sharks on the wall or a picture of a chick with a hook for a hand?  Although there is writing all over the walls and tables, that does not mean the place is dirty.  It was super clean.  If you can't handle some writing on your table then you should go back to the Strip to eat. ...  ... The combos are huge, so come hungry.  The rice was flavorful, the chips were perfectly cooked and salted, and even the fries were great (I wasn't expecting much there from a Mexican joint).  The tacos are loaded with onions, peppers, zucchini, and even some baby spinach.  I had to eat mine with a knife and fork so I didn't make a mess on the white shirt I inappropriately wore for the day.  The veggies weren't greasy like some other reviewers seemed to have a problem with and the tacos were loaded with lots of sauce. ...  ... I didn't have a 100% fairy tale experience here, and I'll tell you why.  Three of the four tacos looked and tasted pretty much the same to me.  I was having a hard time figuring out the difference between them.  Three of my tacos should have had tofu; one had a lot, another had a tiny bit, and the third had none at all.  Also, the tacos could have used a little more flavor-oomph.   ...  ... However, big props for having several choices for us veggie people, friendly service, and a fun atmosphere.  My husband and I are really excited to get back for some adult beverages.  And of course- eat up a couple veggie tacos.
8	2	0	1	0	The only thing Kalila likes here is the VEGGIE TACOS and the rice. ...  ... The rebel special is a great deal. It's only $5 for FOUR tacos, two sides and a drink. ...  ... Not exactly sure what is in the veggie tacos, but there is definitely green and yellow bell peppers, onions and some other veggies. It's covered in a yellow sauce that takes forever to get off your fingers after eating and some black seeds (I have no idea what they are). ...  ... Kalila didn't originally like the rice, but it grew on her. It gets pretty addicting after a few bites. ... The other side we had was chips and salsa. The salsa is more of a pico de gallo. All chunks. Chips were homemade. ...  ... We only come here when we want veggie tacos. Perfect for not eating meat during Lenten Fridays!
8	5	1	0	0	Best tacos I have had in Vegas! The number 8, 10 and 11 all yummy!  Mind you, not traditional necessarily, more fusion in nature. So good. And cheap!
8	1	0	1	0	I think I agree with a lot of the people that ate here - the veg food was not good. ...  ... In summary: ADD ANY AMOUNT OF SALT AND WAYYY LESS OIL!!!! ...  ... My boyfriend got the taco combo with 4 meat tacos. He said they were all good, but I'm not sure what he judges his food by. He's pretty easy to please when it comes to a meal, trust me.  ...  ... As for me, I ordered two veg tacos with different sauce and they were both a disaster. They were drowning in oil which ended up all soaking into the corn tortillas. The best I could do was try to pick out the veggies and tofu, let them drain before eating and then leave the tortillas for the trash. On top of that, the sauces they put on the tacos, while they sounded enticing, were everything but. They definitely needed salt (which wasn't provided on the table) and the flavors mentioned (ie: peanut) were not present in the sauce - just a spicy, sodium-lacking gravy with oil oozing everywhere.  ...  ... Yuck.
8	1	0	2	0	The food here was tasteless and SO oily!!! ...  ... My bf and I went here for some vegan tacos. What we got was flavorless and swimming in oil. We ordered the combo with several different vegan taco options. My bf didn't even eat a single taco, he just picked out a little filling and said he couldn't eat it. I attempted to eat one and was horrified when I looked down at my plate to realize there was a pool of oil under my food. So gross. We ate the plantain chips and threw all the rest of our food away.
8	1	2	1	0	YUCK. This has to be the worst tacos I've ever tried! ... Between the music ,the look of the place and the food I only needed a shotgun to take me out of my misery. The beef and chicken seemed like they were marinated in toilet water and tasted like it. The recent reviews must of been by college students who were high and don't know good tacos... Run away ... TO THE OWNER WHO KEEPS REPLYING BACK TO ME ON YELP  ... YOUR FOOD STILL SUCKS AND I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM COMING DOWN AND SAYING IT TO YOUR FACE! YOU SHOULD BE SPENDING YOUR TIME ON IMPROVING YOUR FOOD NOT ON YELP!!
8	2	1	2	0	I've had Yayo Taco bookmarked for over a year and finally made it over there to sample the wares. ... My husband is a UNLV student, so he got the $5 deal (still in effect March 2012 - 4 tacos, 2 sides, soda). I have no affiliation with UNLV, so I had to pay $7.50 for the same combo. ... There are all kinds of different tacos - the standard chicken, carne asada, carnitas, etc, some 'fusion' style Asian ones, and probably 3 or 4 tofu ones. I really appreciated the variety and uniqueness of the offerings, the extensive beer list, and the 'college-ness' of the whole joint. Unfortunately, I did not like the taste of the tacos (I had chicken, carnitas, and carne asada). Sometimes, you know when you look at cheap ground meat and it kinda reminds you of dog food and you get a little grossed out, but try to put that thought out of your head and eat it anyway? Well at least that's what I do. And sometimes when that happens it turns out really good, but not with Yayo. Maybe it's just the low-price meat, or maybe it's too much oil, as other reviewers have noted, or maybe it's all in my head, but I couldn't finish my tacos.  ... Sad....I wanted to love Yayo, but I'd really rather go to Chipotle (for about the same price).
8	4	0	1	1	Carne Asada tacos are great. Try the green sauce it amazing.  ... The chili cheese fries is a large portion and yummy.
8	5	2	0	0	Best Tacos in Vegas!! Best deal too!!
8	4	0	1	0	The staff is always nice and cheerful, although they can be a bit ignorant. I've received beer poured into the wrong kind of glass and they nearly always mispronounce quinoa. But the vegan tacos are yummy and the laid back atmosphere is relaxing and fun.
8	4	0	1	1	Yayo lacks a bit of consistency, but when it's good, it's GOOD.  This is a very laid back place, reminiscent of a chilled out beach bar that would be better suited for a Southern California beach rather than the Nevada desert, but I'm sure glad it's here.  Even without the amazing UNLV special (4 tacos, 2 sides, and a soda for $5), this place would still be one of my favorite off-strip lunch spots.   ...  ... The service can sometimes be slow, but the staff is always very friendly, and it seems the lack of urgency is just part of the laid back attitude of the restaurent; that being said, the food is definitely worth the wait.  This place is first and foremost, a taqueria, with a number of great specialty tacos that are garnished with some incredible sauces and garnishes.  It feels strange calling this place a gourmet taco place since everything is so cheap, but that really is the best way to describe it.  This place also has a HUGE selection of specialty and craft beers, and an seemingly unlimited selection of taquilas.   ...  ... If you're a UNLV student, a Vegas local, or just want to venture a bit off the strip for a great lunch, check this place out.
8	5	2	2	1	I seriously LOVE this place! I went here for one of my friend's shows and decided to get some food while I was there, and I'm so glad I did! It's kind of a little hole in the wall place, you have to look out for the sign because it's small. The cool thing about Yayo is they let bands play shows, so you have some entertainment while you eat. Granted, the bands are sometimes not so great, but you still have fun watching.  ...  ... Now, the food. My favorite tacos are the veggie, pastor, and carne asada. The pastor is different because it's roasted pork with a pineapple-y kinda salsa on top, soo good! They're also not stingy with the meat, which is awesome. And they have deals for UNLV students, but if you're not a student, it's still pretty reasonable pricing. If you're vegan, they have a few vegan tacos and side options as well. I will say that I'm not crazy about the sides, nothing really stands out there for me.  ...  ... If you're in the area, definitely check this place out! You won't regret it.
8	3	0	1	0	So another venture on campus we saw this place the other day but it was packed because of a band so we decided to come back another night.  I ordered the Taco Combo 4 tacos and 2 sides.  I asked if that was too much food he said "no they are small tacos"  Ahh yeah right huge amount of food for the price!  They also have over 100 beers and almost 100 tequilas.  A cool vibe, nice decor and fun music playing and they do have bands on some nights.  I am only giving 3 stars because the menu is not explained very well and ended up with 2 choices I did not enjoy.  However I would go back and try it again and just ask more questions about the menu options.
8	4	5	10	6	I dig it. Cool little spot..often filled with UNLV students, and musicians of a sort. I stop in now and then for a few tacos and a few great beers.  They have  great beer selection. I'ma fan of the "Innes and Gunn Rum Cask Aged Beer" too sweet for some, great on my pallet with some spicy pastor tacos.  ...  ... I usually sit at the bar when grabbing a quick bite, but on a day off I'll chill at a table, grab a SEVEN and a WEEKLY and just relax for a bit. The owner is super chill, has a great attitude about things and likes what he does. ...   ... It's super, extra casual as it's very close to UNLV. and it's got a dive feel to it, and that's all part of the charm. I spent a few years slumming around New Orleans and it brings me back to that. On that note, it actually reminds me of some of the more creative en devours I experience when in a town like New Orleans. So chill and go with the flow.  ...  ... With a price tag of about $1.75-$5.00 per person, it's a favorite spot for quick  and delicious grub. They have everything from carnitas style tacos to vegetarian options. YaYo taco doesn't pretend to be anything it's not. It's a taco joint with some flavor. I will go back again and again. Happy Eating!
8	2	0	6	1	Having heard so many good things about this place, I wanted to give it a shot. The main thing that kept me from eating there is the really good taco shop just down the street and another good restaurant 3 doors down from Yayo. Couple that with the fact that I didn't realize it was Yayo that had the crowds and such when eating at the other place, I thought it was a different establishment. ...  ... I digress. ...  ... It was a midweek, late lunch when the wife and I finally gave Yayo a go. It was a relatively nice, blustery day, so the doors were all wide open, letting the natural light in, while the wind helped to keep the place from being too hot inside. ...  ... The menu looked small at first (on the display board) then we were handed full menus. Still not huge, just a single side of a piece of paper a step or two up from legal sized paper. The reverse side is their beer list, a huge, huge beer list. ...  ... Debating between their offerings, I settled on the chicken nachos, which is one of my gauges of a Mexican restaurant. If you can screw up chicken, cheese and chips, I don't want to give you a chance with anything else! ...  ... All of their non-beer drinks were single serving bottles or cans, including water (which is kind of ridiculous), then iced tea was suggested. Given the weather, a nice cup of iced tea sounded like it would hit the spot. ...  ... Finding a seat in the eclectically decorated, handmade looking, wood furniture featured dining area near the door, we enjoyed the breeze over a Las Vegas Weekly. ...  ... With a desire to quench my thirst, I took a sip of the tea... Why do places fail to mention when it is flavored tea? I am not a fan of most flavored teas, so getting a jasmine infused assault on my taste buds, literally, left a bad taste in my mouth. ...  ... After a reasonable wait, my nachos came out, the gentleman delivering them was very apologetic for the wait, explaining they had to melt the cheese, etc. It was refreshing to see someone feel bad for taking a reasonable amount of time, where most places act put off when you ask them why it took an hour for service. ...  ... Starting with some of the outlying chips, I dove in. The quality of the chips and cheese made it seem like flavored tea would be the worst part of the meal. And then... I got to the chicken. ...  ... Perhaps, I should have guessed if the tea was going to be flavored, the chicken may have had something 'off' with it as well. The best way I can describe the chicken is that it had a Mediterranean or Middle Eastern essence to it. If I was eating at Paymon's, I would have completely understood the flavoring. ...  ... Once I scraped all of the chicken off, the rest of the nachos were delicious, save for the bits that had absorbed some of the funky chicken's flavoring. ...  ... If I am in the mood just for some meatless nachos, and have something to drink in my pocket, I may go back. The quality of food was good, the ambiance was welcoming, some of the flavors though... I wouldn't give the chicken or tea a second chance.
8	5	0	1	1	I wish this place was around when I lived in the university district. It's cheaper than Taco Bell. The soft corn tortillas literally overflow with the fillings. ...  ... I had the chicken, served with a tomatillo serrano salsa verde and mole sauce, and the carne asada, topped simply with onion and cilantro. ...  ... Both were delicious. Some of the best tacos I've eaten in Vegas so far. ...  ... I'll be sure to update this review once I have the chance to explore its menu further, but I don't often find myself in that part of town and wanted to be sure to make my approval of Yayo Taco known.
8	4	6	6	4	Wait, am I in Cabo?  This is deja vu of my Cabo trip back in my college days....it's a replica of the cantinas around Cabo, Rosarito etc....wood furniture, graffiti on the wall, surfboards on the ceiling. So I start looking over the menu, $1.75-2.25 a taco? Wait, what? Is this a joke? Am I really in Mexico? I almost feel like that old joke like I should go outside and look for stray dogs and cats because clearly something isn't right here, how can it be? My friend ordered the 4 taco combo with a side, I ordered one taco and chips & salsa and plantains, 2 drinks our total came to $16. I'm dying, these tacos have to be terrible. To my surprise, my shanghai taco was pretty good, my chips were so fresh, but my only complaint is the "salsa" was actually pico de gallo, so a little disappointed. Our plantains were a delicious end, cinnamon and condensed milk drizzle over them. They have insane amount of craft beers, and any friend of Chimay is a friend of mine. Also 2 pages of tequila.  ...  ... The crowd was quite, um eclectic? I believe they had a band playing later that night, if you didn't take a shower for a week, no one would notice, and I believe that's the story with the fella that took up residence next to me.  ...  ... Don't get me wrong, this isn't the best food I've had and it's not fine dining, so it kinda makes me laugh at some of the harsh reviews, I mean, come on people, $1.75 a taco? I can totally see why this is a popular spot for UNLV students. Kinda makes me want to go back for my masters, uh wait, nope nevermind, the moment passed.
8	4	0	2	0	Thanks to DD&D for pointing out this little hidden gem. The place remind me of a dive bar that serves some gnarly food. ... I had the taco combo which come with your choice of 4 tacos and 2 two sides. ... -Pescado, Nice pieces of tempura battered fish with nappa slaw and guac. nice and refreshing ... -Texano, barbacoa pulled pork with sour cream. had a smokey flavor to it. Just ok for me ... -Bombay, Amazing flavors with chicken sauteed in yellow mint coconut curry finished with a Tamarind chutney curry. A must try!!crazy flavors for a taco but it works for me ... -Shanghai, Another culinary success! Wasabi seared steak and the wasabi crema really stood out. This taco made me want to go beyond the 4 tacos i had into the food coma. I kept my composure and decided i will return very soon!
8	5	1	4	0	Decided to come check this place out after seeing it on DD&D. So glad we did! Love the atmosphere, like everyone else, it def. reminds me of eating at the small mexican cantina's they have in Baja. I ordered the Camarones and the Pescado tacos. Both of them were delicious and the shrimp were huge! The Napa slaw on the pescado taco was tangy and went well with the sour cream. I also got a side of Ceviche... it was the freshest, most delicious ceviche I have had in awhile. My fave part of the food?  THE CHIPS!   they were crunchy and salty and had cilantro sprinkled over them... the best tortilla chips hands down.  They went perfectly with the ceviche.  My boyfriend ordered the Shanghai taco and I had a bite.  I didn't think anything wasabi would be good on a taco but this taco was amazing!  I wished I had ordered it myself.  He got 2 sides with it and chose the french fries and the chips N salsa(pico de gallo)  the french fries were good, but a little on the soggy side.  ...  ... I am so glad we found this place and I will def. be coming back. We got 5 tacos, 2 sides, ceviche and 2 drinks for under $16 so the prices are very fair. Esp. for the quality and the size of the tacos they give you. I will ignore the useless review from Alberto E. below. By the way he types his reviews I believe he would know what toilet water actually tastes like.  Stay classy my friends!
8	5	1	2	0	A real dive of a restaurant with some top tier quality food. Has a good combo platter that includes 4 tacos, 2 sides, and a drink if you are hungry or you can load up the tacos as you go. ...  ... For $1.50 per taco and $2.25 per specialty taco it is a decent value as they really load up on the meat. Of their regular tacos their Asada is damn tasty and their specialty taco offer a wide variety of flavorings. ...  ... Great place, right across from the university, very easy to miss as they are in a tiny corner of a strip mall that can't be easily seen from the road.
8	2	1	2	1	My wife saw this place featured on DD&D and was excited to check it out. We were very disappointed. We should have gotten the hint when a customer before us demanded his money back because his food looked like crap, which it did. But we thought it was an isolated case. The service wasn't great but that can be chalked up to the cashier being new. When it came time to pick our sides, our choices were limited because they ran out of half of their choices. And this was at 3:00 pm on Saturday. The tacos were okay. I had the Shanghai and Camorones, curry style. They were okay but not DD&D quality. The atmosphere was very shady. The place was dark and dirty. An adult bookstore has more charm to this place... or so I heard since I have never been in one... ...  ... 2 Stars...JUSTICE HAS BEEN SERVED!!
8	4	0	0	0	Some new, rad beer choices! ... Try the Bombay Taco... ...  ... Further, this is an excellent venue for local music. It is among my favorites both to see bands and to play myself. ...  ... Sit in side or out, get buckets of beers and enjoy the constantly changing crowd.
8	4	0	0	0	Of course, I live on the complete opposite side of town!  I will happily venture back down here anytime- excellent beer selection and pricing.  And who can resist yummy tacos?  What draws me in is the free local music!  Yayo is perfectly designed for bands to play, and offers plenty of indoor and outdoor seating.  Great place to come with a group of friends- I would suggest checking it out when bands are playing- just to support the local music scene, as well as a tasty taco shop!
8	5	0	1	0	Went with friends from out of town after seeing it on DD&D. Food was excellent and ingredients were fresh. Someone checked on us twice during our meal to make sure everything was ok. Will definatley be going again.
8	5	0	0	0	Great deal amazing bottled beer selection. Best ICE Tea of any restaurant ever. He mixes two type of loose leaf teas and then chills it. Restaurant has great decor which were all hand made and the walls consist of all hand drawn art by customers. Tacos are EPIC to say the least and seriously CHEAP price tag. 4 tacos 2 sides and a drink is like 7.50. This meal is a LOT of food can barely finish. I always get quinoa and fried plantains which are exceptional! The owner is super down to earth and incredibly chill. He is knowledgeable about the massive beer selection. Everyone I have brought her has only great things to say about YaYo! Anyone who has anything negative to say about this place is a clown shoe.
8	4	0	0	0	Tried after seeing an episode of D.D.and D.  Great food!  A lot of food for decent prices. Definitely plan to go back. Right now my favorites are the Bombay and Camarones tacos.
8	3	0	1	0	It's OK.  Three stars are hard to write because it wasn't terrible, but it wasn't amazing either.  It was just all right.  Definitely a college spot where many a drunk coed has eaten late at night...speaking of, what is up with these restaurants that let you write all over their walls, tables and ceilings? That is such a pet peeve of mine.  I don't want to eat while staring at "Steve is a gay-fer" on the wall. ...  ... The tofu fuma taco has a nice spicy sauce on it, the carnitas are tasty, the carne asada quesadilla was my favorite.  We went at 11:30 and they were already out of two tacos.  I feel like I could just go to a closer taco shop and be just as satified if not more (like Los Tacos). ...  ... I live by Red Rock and I probably wouldn't make a drive all the way down to Yayo just for their tacos.  But if I was on that side of town, then I would venture in here again.
8	3	1	5	2	Yeah, this place was featured on Diners, Drive Ins, and Dives recently and I'm sure business has spiked because of it. Their tacos are their main draw. It's a diverse and ambitious menu featuring 15 kinds of tacos, ranging from traditional to fusion, along with three vegetarian types. ...  ... I went with a combo platter. Four tacos (the Pastor, Texano, Bombay, Shanghai), chips and salsa, and pinto beans. The depth of flavor from the wasabi steak and contrasting textures of the cabbage slaw made the Shanghai my favorite taco. The pastor was good but not as good as the one at Taco El Gordo. The meat in the Texano was completely mushy, rendering it a sloppy mess and I wasn't crazy about the taste of the Bombay. The chips were good, the pinto beans weren't. They were incredibly bland and quite possibly some of the worst beans I've had. ...  ... 3.5 Stars
8	3	0	0	0	I heard a lot about this place so I had to try it. Very cool atmosphere typical for a place for college kids but I will have to tell you wasn't all that impressed with food. I have had better tacos from the local taco wagon around the area. The fish tacos I found to be very bland they do have a good selection of beer service is great here very friendly too sum this review up. cheap eats for college kids good beer and good service
8	2	0	3	1	If you're used to eating great tacos, you will not be a fan of this place. If you are new to fusion or gourmet tacos, a UNLV student, or someone looking for a cool local spot to relax, then this is the place for you. ...  ... We heard about his place from a friend who heard about it from TV (DD&D).  ...  ... Wanting to try a variety of items, we ordered one of each taco: vegetarian,  shrimp, fish, Shanghi (seared steak), and carnitas.  ...  ... We received the following tacos: two shrimp, Shanghi, fish, and carnitas. ...  ... But we didn't complain because we saw that others were having issues with their orders. They seemed to be out of a number of ingredients and mixing up a few orders. We just wanted to eat, so we dealt with what we were served. In fairness to Yayo, I am sure the staff would have corrected the order. The server was helpful and courteous to us and also to others who were having issues with their orders. ...  ... The shrimp tacos were very tasty.  The fish taco was average. The pork was not flavorful at all. And the texture of the meat was mushy.  The Shanghi taco was a huge disappointment. If you are used to fast food (Taco Bell, Dell Taco etc.) tacos, these will be a huge step up for you. But if you eat at any of the locally owned taco spots in the city regularly, you are likely used to flavorful, tender meat. This is not that. I am a fan of the barbacoa type tacos. The meat is usually flavorful and tender.  Sadly, their meat had an odd flavor (curry?) and, like the pork, the texture was...off. Aside from the odd flavor, the meat was lacking flavor in general. I never add salt, and I found myself looking around for a salt shaker to give my tacos some pep. Aside from that, they were just too mushy and soft. The toppings didn't add any flavor to the struggling dish either. I couldn't finish either of the meat tacos.   ...  ... The decor is....street/edgy. I appreciate what they are going for, but what they were doing in the main restaurant didn't work in the bathrooms for me. I really like the dining area. It's thoughtful and artsy. I can see some people allowing their impression of the decor to influence their view of the food. It's got a cool vibe.  ...  ... The writing on the restaurant walls and tables (bring a pen, I guess. They didn't hand any out) was kind of charming. But on the "text" in the bathroom ceiling looked less....playful. I've seen that style of writing on the side of freeways and on abandoned buildings. It sucked a bit of the charm out of the look of the place for me. ...  ... OVERALL: The shrimp tacos were the high point for sure. If I had a choice to eat tacos at Yayos or some national chain,  I'd eat at Yayos. But with many decent taco dives in the city, I will head someplace else when looking for some great tacos.
8	3	0	1	0	Came here at around 2:30pm on a Saturday afternoon and was really disappointed that they were out of A LOT OF ITEMS, including their only beer on draft.  Half of the items I tried to order were out, so I finally asked the question, what DO you have that I can order? ...  ... I split a taco platter with my gf, which consisted of the shanghai, pescado, texano, and some ground pork taco.  The tacos were all just okay, but the price is right (10 dollars including drink), quantity was pretty large, and the food was fresh.  Ask for a side of the spicy mole to kick it up a notch.   ...  ... I really wish they would season their meat a little better.  They must have run out of salt because everything was a bit on the bland side. ...  ... I was expecting a bit more from yayo, seeing as how it was featured on DDD. 3 stars.
8	3	0	0	0	I think this place is pretty good for the price.  The quality of the meat is great but they just needed the extra kick in spice/seasoning. I felt like some of the tacos came out too soggy or mushy or something too. ...  ... $7.99 gives you a combo which comes w/ 4 tacos and 2 sides.  The sides I picked were double-salad which is all spinach. I enjoyed how they LOADED up each taco w/ meat btw. ...  ... -Carne asado tacos were good but the meat needed some extra flavor. If they had some hot sauce this thing would be awesome.  It was a bit mushy/soggy too ... -Al Pastor tacos were good but the texture was over-the top mushy.  A bit too sweet too.  I still liked it tho. ... -Shrimp tacos were a bit disappointing.  They were just fried fish w/ breading, in a taco on a huge lettuce leaf.  Wasn't a fan at all. ... -Shanghai taco was pretty good.  I liked this one. ...  ... I like my tacos to be spicy and the items I ordered had almost no spice.  The hot sauce they offered wasn't to my liking either. ...  ... If they added a hot sauce station this place would be 4 stars easy.  Still - a solid A-OK place.
8	4	0	0	0	Excellent tacos at a local spot. I will definitely will be back when in Vegas again.
8	5	0	0	0	Absolutely loved this place. Had the chips and salsa (pico de Gallo), cheese quesadilla, 2 Bombay tacos and 2 Shanghai tacos, and mint tea. Everything was super fresh, well seasoned and cooked perfectly. I didn't have any taco soggyness issues that a few reviewers mentioned. Great price too! Service was prompt, helpful and friendly :)
8	4	0	0	0	Great tacos!
8	4	1	2	1	I love Yayo's for the food, the craft beer, and the atmosphere.   ...  ... Obviously a college Taco joint, Yayo's has sooo many tasty options!  And the options are inventive.  I order as many things as possible when I'm here, just to try different meats and sauces.  Bombay, asada, pastor, veggie!  ...and I get to pair them with outstanding craft beer...okay, i'm in! ...  ... First came here to watch a friends band play on a Friday night...now I stop by whenever I'm in the area and even remotely hungry.  I even came here to eat two tacos before going to meet some friends for dinner in the area one time. ...  ... I think this is my favorite place in Vegas for tacos...if not, it's certainly one of the best!
8	3	0	0	1	Saw this place on triple D & had to try it out it was just ok. The prices pretty good for the quality of the meat you get, but they need to spice it up a little more it was just a little plan to me. But that's me try it out yourself & see.
8	5	0	1	1	Went here for dinner recently and was pleasantly surprised. I had heard about it but didn't know what to expect. Cool decor inside and friendly service. Amazing selection of beers. Prices are great and I totally underestimated my appetite. I ordered 4 tacos and was getting full after 2. They pile on the meat and everything was delicious. Great little patio area to sit and enjoy. Definitely will be coming back again soon!
8	5	0	1	0	YAYO TACO is my FAVORITE PLACE! ...  ... My boyfriend and I are addicted to these tacos. We first saw this place on Food Network's, Diners, Drive-ins and Dives. The atmosphere is amazing and the selection of alcohol is the best in town!!
8	1	0	1	0	I saw this place featured on Diners, Drive Ins and Dives, so I made it a"must try" on my next trip to Vegas. This place is located in a large plaza with ton of parking. The decor is beachy themed, lots of surfer stuff, the tables are a bit uncomfortable, the servers for the most part were attentive, however the cashier ( young caucasian female) was on the rude side giving every customer an attitude. They seemed to be out of a lot of stuff, which seemed odd because it was 11:30 am on a Friday, you would think they would be prepared and stocked with what they offer, everything I wanted to try was unavailable so I had to settle for the " Al Pastor". The meat itself was tasteless, it needed salt n seasonings BAD! I was hugely disappointed, my husband had the "Bombay Taco" that one was a little more flavorful. I gave this place one star because one of the servers was extra courteous and was extremely attentive with us, however I don't believe I would try this place again, specially not after hearing and confirming it was shut down because of health violation codes. (ewww)
8	4	2	5	2	As seen on Triple "D" ...  ... Great tacos, loved all the unique flavors.  ...  ... The #1 Carne Asada: Great flavor like home, tender and flavorful. ...  ... The #3 simply called "Pastor" no El: Made with brown beer-citrus braised pork with grilled pineapple salsa was killer. You tasted all those flavors and it mixed well! ...  ... The #9 Texano: A slow braised hickory barbacoa pulled pork with yayo sour cream (not sure what it included but it was fab), this was mmm... gud!  ...  ... The #10 Bombay Chicken: Sauted in yellow mint coconut curry (OMG) and tamarind chutney (can u add more unique flavors please!), was simply mind blowingly (if that's a word) different.  ...  ... The #11 Shanghai: I picked this because of the name alone, but was it ever a surprise! ... This was a wasabi steak (shudd I continue?), in Chinese preserved black bean sauce (Hmmm... think about that), with napa cabbage slaw n wasabi crema (again I don't know the exact ingredients to this was but sweet momma of tacos it was great!). The flavors just sang in my mouth. ...  ... My wife and I loved the great prices too. ...  ... The down side was no refills on drinks, its all can or bottles, so it get's 4 stars. ...  ... Other than that we're coming back if we can before we leave town. ... If you like flavor and something different, don't be a La-La, check it out meng! ...  ... TC
8	5	1	4	2	I could see why the Food Network featured this place. It really does tailor to my preferences of a good time. Tacos, tequila, and brewskis! They have a WIDE selection of beer to offer, as well as a wide selection of tequila! ...  ... First, the food. I tried the Bombay taco (which I ordered a second round of), the Pescado, and the beer battered shrimp taco. The Bombay taco was BOMB.com. They should rename it Bomb.com taco...(bad joke. sorry.) It's a nice tender chicken taco drizzled with curry sauce. Super delicious with a nice amount of smack kick punch spice to it! The pescado was also good as well. A very nice and tender pollock fish with topped with guac and sour cream. A very traditional fish taco. The shrimp taco was also amazing! Huge shrimp pieces that don't even fit in the corn tortilla itself! The beer batter was sweet and crispy. Just the way I like it. Tacos there sell for $1.75 for the Classico or $2.25 each for the Loco. What a deal!  ...  ... Johnathan, was an awesome server. He's very fun and knowledgeable about his brews. I tried the Dogfish head 90 there, and if you're up for it, they have the Dogfish head 120 as well. We tried the Wyders which is good (but you can get that at your local convenient store). They had this nice Crispin apple cider that Anthony suggested which was really delicious. It was slightly sweet, but still very delectable. Definitely a good suggestion for someone who isn't a big beer drinker.  ...  ... I had a great experience, and I'm just mesmerized by the sections they have of everything there. They even have vegan offerings there for you to enjoy! They also have bands that play there as well, but aside from the knowledgeable tourists, the place tailors to mostly college students since its right across the street from the campus.
8	4	0	1	0	Chose 4 different tacos which had very different flavors and all were very good. I'd definitely come back here next time I'm in town.
8	3	0	0	0	This is a great place to grab lunch at UNLV.  The tacos are homemade, which is nice! The only downside is you may have to wait 5-10 minutes before your order is ready. It's worth the wait.  ...  ... What I love about this place is you cannot get a traditional taco. The unique options are crafted so deliciously that I often forget I am eating a taco. My go-to choices are the Bombay, Sicilian, and the veggie (the no tofu one) tacos.  ...  ... The best way to take advantage of the special is to order the 4 tacos, 2 sides, and drink special. When you present your UNLV card, you automatically get $1 - $1.50 off. I still haven't figured out how the discount is taken. I have a "usual" and sometimes my total is $6 and sometimes it's $7.  ...  ... I am a bit disappointed in the side dishes. I've tried the fries, the black beans, the quinoa salad, and the guacamole. The sides are passable, but I generally order a double of the garden salad. It's probably better to eat a lighter side dish, since the tacos are very filling.
8	4	0	1	1	Ever since my first time here a few months ago, I've been a monthly visitor of this hole in the wall establishment. Across from the UNLV campus, this is a nice and cheap hangout place for you and your friends. ...  ... The place has an artsy feel to it. I like to call it pretty hipster (but what is hipster anyway?) ...  ... Out of all the tacos I ordered, nothing can beat the traditional carne asada tacos. I order these every time, along with a new type of taco. I've ordered so many, I forgot which ones I tried. ...  ... But I can tell you this. These tacos fill you up pretty quickly despite their small size. They stuff these tacos to the point of overflowing, but I'm not complaining. I finish off my meals with a plastic fork and scrape whats left of the ingredients and leave the plate clean of any crumbs.
8	3	2	1	0	Mmmm, asian inspired tacos! Pretty happening beer list! My ear drums bleeding on live band night, suck! Well they weren't bleeding but let me tell you what it was insanely fucking loud in there. Like so loud you couldn't order your food at the counter you literally had to point at them menu to what you wanted. It took forever to get our food though it may have been ready but I couldn't hear if my name was being called.  ...  ... Highlights.. Shanghai Taco, Pescado Taco and the Bombay Taco. Lowlights.. Having tried most of the sides, chips and salsa is the best one with sweet potato fries being the worst  which were greasy, burnt and limp.  ...  ... Now with all that said I like Yayo, it's alright! Seriously though, come early before the live music starts. Unless of course hearing loss is your thing.
8	3	1	2	1	After seeing this place featured on Food Network, we had to try it.  It was unique, but I think it got a little more hype than it should have.  Definitely a hole in the wall and the food was good, but not outstanding.  I might stop in again if I happen to be in the immediate vicinity (doesn't happen often) but I don't think I'll make any special trips down there.   ...  ... Limited seating, and it's kind of like a deli for ordering, place your order at the counter then sit down and hope you hear your number called over the music.  Not the greatest place for picky eaters.
8	4	0	0	0	I found out about Yayo Taco on a Vegan website and I am glad I did.  The Vegan tacos are awesome!  The service was friendly and informative.  My girlfriend and I will definitely be back for more.
8	3	0	0	0	My mom's friend saw this restaurant on "Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives" and suggested that she try the food.  It was only mid-afternoon but they had no carnitas!  Before receiving our food, I looked for a salsa bar but was disappointed that the tacos were already topped with salsa (different type for each taco).  I am particular about my toppings.  Sometimes I like to mix salsas together or add more heat.  I was hoping for more authentic Mexican tacos but I would consider them gourmet tacos.  I was full but not satisfied!
8	4	0	0	0	We decided to have dinner here because the prices and reviews were great. They did not disappoint! We had some of the best vegetarian tacos ever! It's a little off the strip, near UNLV and totally worth the time to find. The manager even came over and told us about a poetry slam they were going to have and some live music events. it's a very casual place with great food! I would definitely go back.
8	2	0	1	0	Saw this place on the food network and I decided to try them out cause they looked so delicious on tv. I came here after a long night/morning of  partying/raging and ordered 70 bucks worth of food. Pretty much I ordered 1 or 2 of each taco and 2 build it yourself nachos. I tried at least 4 kinds of tacos. I don't remember which one but all of the meat in every taco tasted the same. Seems like the meat was boiled the same and the only thing different was the sauce they put on. I was kinda disappointed or maybe I'm too spoiled to the Mexican food here in San Diego. I would come back to this place.. The only reason why I'm giving this place 2 stars is because the guy that worked there gave me a discount for ordering so much and gave me a few extra tacos.
8	3	0	0	0	I came here to eat lunch with my boss and coworker. I had been eating tacos all day because of Taco Tuesday, but I was still craving more. They had a rebel special for UNLV students, so I decided to order that. The special included 4 tacos of your choice and two sides. Due to my passionate love affair with shrimp, I decided to stick with that. They were out of rice, so I was stuck with beans and salsa for my two sides. ...  ... When the food came out, it definitely looked appealing. The salsa looked very vibrant and colorful. The shrimp tacos were covered in a beer batter that was cooked to a perfect golden brown. I couldn't wait to take a bite into the foodie goodness. ...  ... Once I bit into the taco, I was greatly disappointed. The batter to shrimp ratio was greatly disproportionate. Instead of tasting the shrimp, I tasted batter ..and that's about it. Sure, the food looked pretty, but that was the extent of it's appeal. The salsa was good, but the chips were way too salty. It was all a big let down. ...  ... If my coworkers decide to come here for lunch again, i'll probably head over to Baja instead.
8	5	0	0	0	I went to Yayo Taco for the first time today on a recommendation from a friend. He told me to expect fusion style tacos, I was like "what?" Yayo Taco specializes in Mexican classics with an ethnic twist. I don't really know how to explain it in any other sense. Anyway, I'm a student at UNLV. Which is great because five dollars buys me 4 tacos, cantina style, and two sides with my rebel card. Great deal even if the food was sub-par... ...  ... I walk in, I'm greeted by this loco cashier named Jonathan. He's a friendly guy who seems to know at least a fact or two about every beer in the fridge; there are hundreds... He set me up with a DogFish Midas Touch after we talked for a minute; great choice man! But it's a sweet beer and not for everyone. I ordered two pollo tacos and two veggie tacos, sweet p fries and quinoa salad. A touch choice considering the menu has pretty good variety. ...  ... Pollo tacos: braised chicken with a mole marinade topped with a tomatillo salsa, amazing depth of flavor, I typically don't like the bold taste or a traditional mole, but it wasn't a traditional mole, just mild enough for me. I'll order these every time I come back. Next time though, I'll omit the salsa. I didn't like it but it was easy enough to push aside. ...  ... Veggie tacos: spinach, peppers, onions and other ish served with a cream sauce. Very delicious, consistent option. Fresh veggies, good sauce, etc. ...  ... Quinoa salad was fresh, sweet p fries were good if not just a little bit on the salty side... ...  ... This place was features on diners drive-ins and dives, which didn't factor into my decision but it's worth mentioning. I took a peek in the kitchen and the owner (who was on the show) was working side by side with his staff, a quality I look for in $ - $$$ restaurants.  ...  ... Overall: five stars, no complaints, I'll amend my review as I try more dishes... ...  ... Great... ... -Service, eating within fifteen minutes, front of house knows their ish ... -Atmosphere, cool beach cantina theme, surf boards cover the ceiling ... -Food, look above ... -beer,wine,tequila: how may I help you? ...  ... In conclusion, I'll be back, maybe every day...
8	5	0	0	0	This is the best restaurant in Las Vegas. Amazing vegetarian options, and a really chill vibe. Free foosball. Killer ambiance. Cheap. Tacos for $1.75, drinks $5.75 ...  ... The food was AMAZING.  ...  ... Jonathan, a server here, is the best. He'll help you pick your food, he understands cilantro allergies and best of all his tequila recommendations are out of this world!
8	4	0	0	1	If you are at UNLV and looking for a good cheap Taco fix then this is the place to go. The UNLV student special is definitely worth it. something like 4 tacos and two sides for 6 dollars. The portions are good as well especially for the amount of money you pay.  ...  ... The food is not overly impressive. Its decent quality with decent ingredients and like I said well portioned for the money. They do have a good list of 20 tacos but the student special only includes like 9 of them.  You can sub out the other tacos into the special for extra charge which I advise you do.  ...  ... The service is good and they have a full service bar which is awesome if you need a good margarita after a long day of horrible classes.
8	5	0	0	0	I'm always lookin' for thing's to eat that i can't get where i'm from. Yayo taco has become one of my must-go-to places when I'm in vegas. You gotta appreciate the artistry that goes into fusion food; finding the right textures and the right flavors to meld with the 'taco' blue print. ...  ... the menu is vast, touching all corners of the world, from japanese to italian inspired tacos. the beer menu is also vast which is a pleasant surprise. it's intimidating at first  but i always go with the people that work there to help.  ...  ... If/ when you go, I hope Jonathan is working. He won't just tell you what's popular, he's knowledgeable about both the food and beer menu, and he helped make my experience at yayo taco amazing!
8	1	4	3	2	Are you kidding me, a "C" health rating!?!? Do you know what it takes to rate a C? The rats must be boinking the cockroaches on the raw chicken! Seriously though, you have to score more than 28 health violations to rate a C? Oh and you have to not care enough to do anything about it. For sure there are some health violations that are a little understandable: exit sign has to be X number of feet from the door, sanitizer location, etc.  Once the health inspector finds a few violations, you have 30 days to fix em... To get downgraded to a B! What did they find here?  ...  ... I'm sorry but anyone giving this place more than 1 star is a fool! The owner of this shit hole doesn't care about you, obviously. I also don't care if the food is tasty, it might make you sick or at the least have mouse shit in it.  ...  ... On a good note, there is a hammock there so when you get sick you can lie down until the EMT's get there. ...  ... Sorry to be so harsh but there is NOTHING worse than this. Not lumpy potatoes nor bad service. This is the worst thing a restaurant can be: Dangerous. ...  ... The tequila and beer selection is really, really good, the staff seems nice but for God's sake, fix your shit! The local channel 5 news even did an expos on this place on their "dirty dining" spot and they STILL don't clean it up. Booooooooo! ...  ... They raise their rating, I'd LOVE to come in a have a taco
8	3	2	2	2	The following sentence should tell you a lot: I waited 24 hours to write this review to make sure we didn't get food poisoning. The good news: we didn't! But both of us felt a bit...off a few hours after we ate, but that could have been all in our heads.  ...  ... The reason for all the suspicion: Yayo Taco has their C rating proudly displayed next to the register. We made the mistake of looking up their violations while we were waiting for our food, thinking that maybe the violations were the goofy ones. Nope. Cross contamination, failure of employees to wash hands, inadequate food temperatures. At this point, we had already paid for the food, so we took it home and rolled the dice.  ...  ... The food is actually pretty tasty. We each got the taco combo: your choice of 4 tacos and two sides for $7.25, a screamin' deal. Seafood tacos and tacos locos are an extra 50 cents each. I had two carne asada (awesomely greasy/fatty) tacos and two carne molida (ground beef with an Italian-leaning red pepper and basil "salsa) tacos, with black beans and chips/salsa. Fish tacos got a thumbs up from Boyfriend. The tacos are street-size, so 4 is just about the right amount of food.  ...  ... I'll definitely be back when they bring their rating up a letter or two. The food is worth another trip, but the violations just make eating here a roll of food poisoning roulette right now.
8	1	4	7	5	Based completely on the comment from this business to my *honest* review, I won't be coming back. The health department is around for a reason and, if this restaurant rejects their standards as too "institutionalized", I can't imagine wanting to give this place another chance. As I stated, if the violations were silly ones, like not having their letter grade displayed in the exact place specified by the health department, I'd overlook the grade. Unfortunately, this restaurant appears to proudly flout safe food-handling procedures and they're extraordinarily sanctimonious about it. Listen, Yayo Taco, I'm not in cahoots with "the Man". I just don't like food poisoning.
8	4	0	0	0	Great place that lived-up to all of the hype.  A great place to eat and socialize.  The tacos were great.  We tried the 4 taco sampler and was not disappointed.  The hardest thing was deciding on which taco to have as the list contained 15 different ones.  They all tasted great.  You can't go wrong with the sampler with 4 different tacos and 2 sides.  A place, we plan on visiting again.

8	5	0	1	0	Review by a Restaurant Consultant ...  ... When Guy Fieri highlights your restaurant on Diners, Drive-In's and Dives, you know that it's got to be an interesting place.  I've tried several restaurants in Southern California and Las Vegas that he's reviewed.  When Guy went to Yayo's near UNLV, I knew we had to try it. ...  ... Yayo's location is in a small shopping center directly across from the university.  Usually, with in-line restaurants, you don't expect too much.  I was pleasantly surprised when we visited the restaurant.  The ambiance is really interesting, with almost "Old Mexico" themed tables and lighting.  This theme is carried on outside on the patio as well.   ...  ... With restaurants, the food must impress.  Boy, Yayo's really hit a home run with their food.  Their portions are more than sufficient, especially when you realize what a value their food really is.  They have the best soft tacos in town!  If you get their student special, you probably won't be able to finish the plate. ...  ... The other aspect of Yayo's that's impressive is their service.  Jonathan greets you nicely as you enter, assisting you with your menu selections.  His laid-back attitude is perfect for Yayo's.  Their menu is quite large, so the extra help with items is always appreciated. ...  ... Yayo's is our go-to Mexican quick service restaurant in Las Vegas.  As long as you understand that it's not fine dining, you'll be fine.  The next time you're in town, drop by Yayo's and you will be pleasantly surprised.

8	4	0	0	0	Tonight I stopped by here to meet up with friends and ordered nachos and guacamole. These guys hand cooked their nachos so it takes a bit long before my food arrived but once I tried them, the wait time was worth it. I love the cheese covered nachos dipped in perfectly fresh guacamole. The only down side is that this is a very unhealthy item due to the frying of the nachos. Also, at ~$8 for nachos and guacamole and a diet Coke, that's kind of pricey I thought.
8	5	0	0	0	Great tacos, great atmosphere, awesome taco's......
8	4	0	0	0	Always fresh, great variety of taco flavor combinations, and an infinite list of tequilas and beers. Friendly service makes this place a real winner.
8	2	1	5	1	Bad service, always dirty and usually out of the vegan tacos I stopped in for anyway--but I still like coming here. ...  ... What I don't like is that in response to YET ANOTHER C health rating, instead of cleaning up, the owner posted an intense nonsensical conspiracy rant on ktnv's facebook after they featured him on dirty dining. ...  ... So I will be truly sorry if Yayo's cinnamon-y sweet black bean dip is gone from my life... but it won't be because he's getting 'picked on' by SNHD. It's because he's too lazy to keep things clean and in good repair. It's just the truth.
8	4	0	2	1	Saw it on D-cubed, and I'm in town with my daughter for a soccer tournament.  We like Mexican food (we're from Sacramento), so we decided to stop by.   Place was very uncrowded for a Friday lunch; only a few tables occupied.   Server was really nice  - my daughter likes her tacos pretty plain, and he took her order really nicely.    ...  ... We each ordered carne asada tacos, and I ordered a carnitas taco, and she ordered the pulled pork.   The carne asada didn't really stand out  - the mole was understated.   The carnitas was fantastic, as well as the pulled pork.   One think I noticed in previous reviews was that the texture of the meat was mushy - that was not an issue with our meal.   In fact, I thought the texture was a highlight. ...  ... Price is right, food is good, service is good.  We'll be back!
8	2	0	0	0	The staff was nice, but the food wasn't very good.
8	5	1	4	2	I thought I'd never find a cheap place in Vegas. But, oh my gawd, did I find one really!? Yayo Taco is the bomb! $1.75 to $2.25 tacos with a lot of tasty goodness overflowing in your mouth. If you happen to be in Vegas, be sure to visit this joint just to have a taste of why I'm so excited about it. It's near the strip, just take a cab ride. Come on, you can do it! You must try their Bombay Taco and Shanghai Taco. It's oh so good to the very last bite. (Don't bite your fingers! The sauce drips.) I also tried their Pastor Taco and Carne Asada Taco. They were on the spot delicious in everything! Who cares if the place looks like a dive bar?! It is a dive bar! The food tasted awesome and they have a whole page list of beers. Go international! Drink it with a great taco! This is my second flavortownusa-hop. I haven't been disappointed. I'll always pass by this place when in Vegas.
8	2	0	0	0	Saw this on DDD and tracked it down.  Website said nothng about being closed thru March 27 - stinks that I went to the trouble of finding this place (and the location is easier to miss than you might think) only to find out that they were closed.  Looked good on TV, but it seemed a little dirty up close.  Still...wanted to give it a whirl
8	1	2	5	0	I saw this place on triple D and was eager to try it out. I am visiting from San Diego and came in with my entire family. Let me start off by saying I will never be back due to their shady ways. I ordered the nachos (priced at $4.25) and the taco combo which comes with 4 tacos and 2 sides (priced at $7.75). The cashier, Miguel tells me the total is $23. It didn't sound right but I paid and sat down at one of the tables. It was then that it hit me that my bill should have been $13/14. I bring it to Miguel's attention and he tells me, "we will get it taken care of." I have no idea what that means so we finish eating and I return to the counter to collect the cash I was overcharged! ...  ... Miguel asks me to speak with Jaime who I assume is a manager. Jaime looks at the receipt and hands me a $1.25. He tells me that each taco was an additional 50 cents because they were not part of the special! He then tells me the nachos that were listed at $4.25 were an additional 4 dollars because I added meat, sour cream and guacamole. My response, "Why wasn't I given all this info when I ordered." He said he was sorry but there wasn't anything he could do. I asked him if I could speak with the manager and he told me he was the manager. This was the worst customer service I have ever experienced!!! Frustrated like hell, We just left! ...  ... As for the food, nachos were average at best. Carnitas tacos were decent but nothing special. Don't waste your time with this place. They obviously went above and beyond for triple D but don't treat regular customers with the same respect!!!!!
8	5	0	0	0	I used to eat here every tuesday when I was a student at UNLV for 2 semesters. I look forward to going there every time I go back to Vegas. It is a unique taco shop and I locve the menu items such as : the Texicano and the bombay. Never had any issues there, so before you jump on the bandwagon it is still an awesome taco shop and the ideas that they have for tacos are amazing.
8	4	1	1	1	I really like Yayo Taco -  the food is great and they have a good selection of uncommon beers. They have pretty low prices for the caliber of their street tacos and the staff is always nice.  ...  ... Be aware they often have live acts at night (music, poetry, etc) that aren't great to listen to if you're trying to have quiet dinner or something. For lunch, this place is fantastic though.  ...  ... t's about $2 a taco and they give you a lot of food. Also, I'm seeing people complain about the bathrooms in this place, but I've seen apartments in this area with much worse. Overall, I recommend Yayo Taco.
8	5	0	0	0	Lots and lots of wonderful flavours packed into a small taco.  You can try foods from all corners of the world without leaving your seat.  ... Well worth visiting!!!
8	1	0	0	0	Saw this on food network and decided to try it.  The cashier was extremely rude and condescending - and the wait for the order was really long.  The food was ok- but after experiencing such a negative and unhappy person at the register - the whole experience was already ruined. The place was also not very clean. Will never go back.
8	5	0	0	0	Kinda small for a loud live band but it was fun. Like you'd come here with all your friends. Fantastic beer and tequila choices and great tacos. I'm glad I finally tried it out.
8	3	0	0	0	I tried this place based on the recommendation of a co-worker and I thought that the food was pretty good.  The menu offers an array of tacos, all of which are just a little different than you might expect.  These tacos are small "street" style, but the flavor combinations are unique.  I have tried most of the tacos on the menu and all of which I have liked, namely, the pastor, carne asada, texano and carnitas.  The prices are fair at around $2.25 per taco and the ingredients are usually falling out of the tortilla.  The ingredients seem fresh and the unique act of adding flavors such as wasabi, curry or balsamic cruda to a street taco is a tasty concept.  This place will not replace your favorite street taco stand, but it was a nice change. ...  ... Now, I ate at this place twice before I got around to writing a review and when I did, I came across a health inspection on Yayo Taco.  My above review stands and I did like their food, but I can not give more than 3 stars to a place with such a spotty health record.  This place was shutdown in Aug. 2012 by the health district.  A week later they reopened with an A grade.  However, just four months later they received another C grade and then most recently another A grade.  If this place could produce some consistency with their health inspections I would feel better about giving them a better yelp rating.
8	1	0	1	0	Seriously?! Saw this on food network, so we thought we'd give it a try. That was the wrong decision. Horrible food. The tacos had no flavor. Honestly, I could get better tacos from the taco trucks back home in Los Angeles. Had stomach pains after as well. Don't waste your time for less than mediocre food.
8	5	0	0	0	We are in Vegas on vacation and we always enjoy finding the local places to eat that you just can't find anywhere else. Yayo Taco was excellent!!! I'm pretty sure we ordered one of everything from the menu; the Pollo, the Camarones, the Texano and the Shanghi tacos were incredible!!! You gotta go...
8	4	0	3	2	GREAT EXPERIENCE!! ... Let's start with the CONS: ... 1- Place is kind of hidden, we passed it a couple of times, no visible signs from the street ... 2- Tacos are a little over priced ... 3- Not a large menu, do not expect to see 100 things to choose from ... The PROS: ... 1- Not a chain restaurant ... 2- Great atmosphere ... 3- Easy to read menu, not to many choices which for us, worked out great! ... 4- Available parking ... 5- Something different to try when you need to excite your palate ... 6- Original flavors ...  ... We were immediately greeted as we walked in, on this terribly hot afternoon. The gentleman at the register was welcoming and genuine, most of all, when we mentioned that this was our first visit. He explained to us the difference between the tacos and even made suggestions on what appeared to be the most popular choices. ... Noisy? Crowded? Not this Saturday, perhaps because school is out? Not sure, but for us, it was actually perfect.  Nice Latin music playing in the background, a couple swinging on the hammock and a man on his laptop in the "relaxing area", the tables were comfortable and there was lots of casual dcor to look at. ... We both had the 4-taco combos with a variety of tacos. By far our favorite was the Shanghai taco, yet we could not stop talking about the Texano and the Bombay. ... The tortillas were not greasy; they were nice and hot and almost had a slight crunch to them. The meats were very tender, tasty and well prepared. The sauces were extremely savory and original. Although the tortillas appear to be small, these tacos pack a great amount of filling which made the prices definitely worth it. The sides were also quite surprising. I had the Quinoa Aztec salad, which was minty fresh and well seasoned and the fried plantains were still hot when brought to our table. My husband was more traditional, he chose the chips & salsa and black beans, both were very flavorful and appeared to be freshly cooked.  Over all we were very satisfied, and we are definitely planning on returning with friends. As another yelper said, not your traditional street-vendor tacos, but definitely something delicious to try and come back to when you want more than the usual!  ... We would also like to mention that we did our homework, and although we had read about concerns with this restaurant in regards to health inspections, we verified that their last inspection in May 2013, had an A result. So let's be fair to our local businesses, let's read more than bad reviews when making a choice on where to take your business. Way to go Yayo's!
8	5	1	0	0	Always great food service, omg the Beer menu is great they have it if you want pretty much. I love them..
8	3	0	0	0	I'm from Chicago, used to charbroiled carne asada tacos... Wanted to try something different. Overall, I think it's pretty good here. I liked that I ventured out of my comfort zone & tried "the shanghai" taco- which was pretty good! I also had a fish taco (I thought was ok), carnitas taco (was good, just not what I'm used to) but I really didn't like their carne asada taco. All 4 came on the taco platter with 2 side; I got the black beans (which were bland), and the chips & salsa which was bland as well.  ...  ... Recommend: yes, but try to venture out of your expectations & try a unique taco you may not find elsewhere. I guess it's more of a west coast thing I'm not used to in Chicago... But I would try it again.  ...  ... PROS: free parking lot, not crowded, unique food, friendly service, unique environment ...  ... CONS: it was hard to find because there is no sign overhead to distinguish it from the neighboring businesses in the strip mall, too dark inside to see our food while we ate, kind of shady characters outside on front made me think twice about going in... Looks kind of like a dive bar or biker bar at first glance.  ...  ... I saw this initially on Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives ...  ... Our total was about $25.00 for two taco platters.
8	4	0	0	0	I think what Yayo Taco offers best is ambiance - it's amazing how quick you can go from high-strung college day to lazing around on the couches with a really great vegan taco. Of course, it could not accomplish that with a really, really great taco, either - even the taco-newbie in me wanted to go for seconds, and definitely would have if it wasn't for the collective sofa-round heart-to-heart we were too preoccupied with to bother trying to look for a new menu. ...  ... There are a lot of taco options, varied in ethnic style, ingredients, heaviness, and price. Although I can't quite say there'd be something for everyone in there, since some of us still did struggle to decide on a taco, there really is a lot more than you'd expect, and even the Asian-flavor tacos are good without just playing the cutting-edge fusion card. The affordable price will appeal to college students as well. ...  ... I think this review hovers more around a 3.5, but then I too vividly remember how much we struggled to try to find the menu to put in a second set of orders, that the tacos must have been really, really good. 4 stars for now and a pending revisit, it is.
8	5	0	0	0	Have been going there for a couple of months now. Haven't had a bad taco yet. It's the way food should be . No need to add anything to it, just eat it straight from the kitchen. Love the shanghai tacos. the staff is great and very friendly. Have taken several friends and and all have love it. Can't wait to go back. ... CAUTION!!!!! it's addicting.
8	5	0	1	0	I have been putting off writing a review for a couple of months. Let me first start off by saying that I went to Yayo's a week ago and they are now CLOSED.  Everything was packed up-no sign or life could be seen in the restaurant.  I tried calling the place but the phone just rang and rang. ...  ... I am not sure why they closed but it could be the fact that there was no one ever in the place when my bf and I went there.  I was surprised by the lack of patrons on our previous visits since it was so close to UNLV.  I literally cried myself to sleep b/c they have the most delicious street tacos ever!   ...  ... Ambience/Service: ... You order at the counter and pay.  It is very reasonably priced.  $2-$4 a taco depending on if  classico or loco tacos are ordered.  The sodas are canned 12 oz and they will give you a plastic cup of ice if you ask.  You then take a seat at one of their many tables. They are all big wood tables and benches that back to other tables.  So if you want privacy or elbow room, then you won't get any...but again we were there when no one else was and had the place to ourselves.  The food comes out pretty quickly. ...  ... Food: ... Now back to my review of the food in case they ever reopen... ...  ... As I have said, I have been there a handful of times and tried most of the meat tacos.  My bf tried the shrimp tempura taco since I don't eat seafood.  Here's a rundown of the tacos we've had: ...  ... Carne Molida- hands down the best taco for me.  This is their crown jewel!  It is a finely ground beef taco with a roasted bell pepper balsamic crudo.  You would never think that this would belong in a Mexican dish and I was really skeptical b/c balsamic vinegar can be very acidic.  However, it was delicious. I could eat it everyday and I am not joking!!! ...  ... Carne Asada- just ok.  Nothing was special about it. On one occasion, the meat was very burnt b/c they had left the tray on the burner too long I believe.  I brought the taco to gentleman that had taken our order to let him know it was burned.  He politely took it from me and asked if he could taste it.  I said yes, of course and he apologized when he realized it was in fact burned.  He replaced it with another taco of my choosing.   ...  ... Camarones- my bf said he thought it was pretty good and that the shrimp was not battered to heavily and it was not soggy.  He said he would probably stick with the fish taco instead. ...  ... Pescado- my bf had this and said that the fish tasted fresh and the slaw on top was good.  Nothing really stood out but it wasn't bad either. ...  ... Carnitas- pretty amazing and they added pineapple salsa.  The meat was not fatty at all (some people like that but I don't).  The meat was also finely shredded, which I prefer.   ...  ... Texano- again just ok. Not something I would order again. ...  ... Sicilian- great! Chicken with pesto and the red bell pepper crudo...again, you think that this has no place in a taco but it was excellent! I would order this again. ...  ... Bombay- I am not crazy about Indian food but I found that curry flavor to be very mild.  My bf on the other hand loves Indian food and thought it was a great taco. ...  ... Shanghai- Again, I am not crazy about ethnic food but it was still delicious and I would not turn my nose up at this if someone presented it to me.  The wasabi crema was very mild and it was not spicy at all...and that's coming from a wuss that can't handle spicy foods. ...  ... Sides- we only ever got the chips and salsa.  The chips appear to be made in house are thick and served with a pico de gallo salsa.  They don't give you a ton of chips but I still think they are more filling than thin ones.  They do serve other sides like black rice and beans but I never got a chance to try them:( ...  ...  ... So sad that they are now closed but I hope that they will reopen soon.
8	4	0	0	0	Found this restaurant on a food network app. I got the four taco combo meal. All four tacos I had were completely different. For a great price for flavor, I would check this place out.
8	2	0	0	0	had lunch there today with 2 coworkers. food was fine. the music was so loud we were literally yelling at each other.  LOWER THE MUSIC VOLUME at least for the lunch crowd.  Yikes... it was hard rock and it was LOUD!
8	3	0	1	1	Food good... Cool little place... One thing that bother me I was told they can't honor the promotion on Yelp, cause it doesn't work and they don't know how to use it. So you out of luck. It's confusing why it still on yelp false advertisement. Not cool ;(
8	4	0	0	0	Great selection of tacos and meats.  EVEN larger selection of beers and tequilas. ...  ... Service can be friendly when they want to, and consistency are my only reasons to keep this off a full 5 star rating.
8	4	0	2	2	WHERE ELSE might you find Tacos of chicken sauted in yellow mint coconut curry and sweet tangy tamarind chutney? If that doesn't do it for you maybe the slow roast chicken basil almond pesto red pepper balsamic cruda taco will do. And if your feeling beefy the number eleven wasabi seared steak in Chinese black bean salsa with crisp cabbage slaw wasabi crema you might dig into? They got all that and bunches more but those were the ones I tried that were all awesome delicious not just sauced up but developed with great flavors and topped with out of the ordinary ingredients.  ...  ... Only $2.50  each for these gourmet tacos! ...  ... Side dishes cost .75 cents each I tried the quinoa salad. After the mind blowing tacos this salad didn't do it for me but it might for you. ...  ... If you are coming from out of town I recommend that you call to make sure they are open. Last year in August they closed with out notice, everything was packed up, and when I called the phone rang and rang without a message.  ...  ... They are a little hard to find. No sign on top of the restaurant. Only a picture of a big sombrero on a side wall. The inside is very raw and the chairs were made in a wood shop. ...  ... 4.5 stars ...  ... This one made it for my Las Vegas Rotation!
8	2	0	0	0	The tacos cost $2.50 each and I tried the fish tacos.  I enjoyed the fish tacos at Del Taco better than these.  The wooden chairs were uncomfortable and there were lots of flies flying around.  Gross.  I won't be back.
8	4	0	0	0	Totally dig this place! Had the Bombay taco which I would give a solid 5 stars, the carne asada another 5 stars, and the shanghai which wasnt for me but I would still give it a 3 star rating. Had a HUGE beer menu and tequila menu, its a whole page written in the tiniest font thats how many they have. They even have a beer pairing menu to go with your tacos. It's great, go there and eat for sure.

8	5	0	0	0	This place has awesome tacos. Tacos is one of those foods where it is on, or off. ... For example, in Los Angeles, King Taco is a taco chain that is popular, but I must say i am not much of a fan of King Taco, buy definitely a Fan of Yayo. ... Besides the basic flavors, their specialty tacos are really good. The Shanghai is an excellent fusion of Asian and Latin spices. The crispiness of the Pescado (fish) was to absolute perfection!
8	5	0	0	0	These are the absolute best tacos I've had in my entire life. They are also $2.50 each. Need I say more? Must order: the Bombay, tofu Tigre and the texano. Did I mention the Bombay? Delish.
8	5	0	0	0	These are by far the best gourmet tacos I have ever had. I can't stress how delicious these tacos are. Yum! :D
8	4	0	0	0	A little hard to find. We drive around for a good 10 min lol I'm from LA and the only reason I usually come to Vegas is to party but we made it out here early this trip and wanted to try this place out. Tacos were amazing! Big beer and tequila selection! So glad I was able to make it out here to try this amazing food!
8	3	0	0	0	Came here because of the TV show Diners Drive In' s and Dives.  This place was just ok. Service was just ok. We ordered the Nachos and when he brought it to us he said he would bring the guacamole and never did.  The tacos were different but just ok. I probably would not come again.
8	1	0	3	0	Tacos had no flavor! Couldn't even finish them!!!! Came here because I had seen this spot on the food channel "diners, drive-ins and dives" with Guy Fieri, do no recommend this place!
8	5	0	0	0	Yesterday For lunch I tried their carnitas, shanghai, and texano tacos locos. All good, but I would say carnitas were my favorite. The fries were fresh cut and not the slightest bit greasy. Cool atmosphere and great bottled beer selection...the only negative is, where were places like this when I was in college!?! ...  ... Great atmosphere, food, and PRICE!
8	3	0	0	0	Saw this place on Diners, Drive-ins, and dives so I had to come by this time when in Vegas.  This place is not your typical mexican food taste/flavor. They serve a bunch of  street sized tacos- which are small but I think thats a good thing because they've got so many fun flavored tacos to choose from. I had the classic pollo which was my favorite and I also had the Shanghai and the carne asada.  They were all pretty good. I got a side of pino beans but did not care for them- they needed more salt  or something. There is a good beer selection and the deco is really cool. For me, it was fun to experience but I probably wouldn't come back over and over again- maybe once more to try a few more of the other crazy tacos. I'm from San Diego so I tend to crave more of the authentic mexican flavors and a CA burrito.  Definately a fun place to try.
8	5	0	0	0	Here on a quick trip. Wa recommended by a student at the airport.  Did not disappoint. Nachos are great and so are the tacos.  Good for vegetarians.
8	5	0	0	0	Found this place on DDD- the Shanghai Taco is the best!!! Such a great place to get some yummy food for an affordable price.
8	2	0	2	0	I really really wanted to like this place. It was featured on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives and looked amazing. Looks, in this case, were deceiving. ...  ... Definitely a fun and interesting atmosphere. The walls were decorated by adoring customers and employees...and probably more than a few wise ass college students. Everything was wood finished and it felt like a little cantina one might find in Cabo. ...  ... We walked in and no one greeted us, but there was a man in the corner with sunglasses on and a lap top in front of him that just stared at us creepily. I later realized that he was the owner (I recognized him from the show)....Okie dokie. ...  ... On to the food. My wife and I shared the camarones, carne asada, pollo, pescado, carnitas, and shanghai tacos. The only ones even remotely memorable were the carnitas and carne asada. They both had a nice char on the meat and good flavor...but nothing special and not any better than any other run-of-the-mill taco joint. My main complaint about everything was the complete lack of flavor...in particular, acid and salt. Everything was in dire need of seasoning. I don't care how many ingredients you put in your marinade, if there's no salt, it's bland. In addition, PLEASE serve all tacos with a lime! ...  ... The last thing I want to talk about are the tortillas. They were so incredibly tiny for the sheer amount of filling that's in each one. After one bite, everything falls out into your hands and the only thing in which to wipe them off are tiny, thin, little square bev naps...I went through about 30 of them. ...  ... No brightness, no pop, no spice, bland flavors and a tortilla delivery system that falls way too short, Yayo Taco doesn't live up to the hype.
8	4	0	0	1	This place was on triple D. One of the best tequila line ups I have seen and their beer selection is off the charts. I got the 4 taco sampler with plantains and chips and salsa. Also got a Mexican coke, in a glass bottle (the only way to have a coke).  Service was prompt and everyone was nice. It was a Tuesday night and a little slow.  There was a live band with a jazz flute. Nice touch.
8	3	0	0	0	Wanted to try something in the Vegas area recommended by Guy and Diners Drive in's and Dives...well this place was a dive alright, we couldn't even find the place after 3 drive by's..no signage, nothing in this strip mall!  Great array of international Flavors in small street sized tacos.  We had the plantains and black beans for an appetizer, yum, crispy and beans were flavorful and a bit sweet.  I had the Bombay, chicken in an Indian curry, good Flavors, i think mine was missing the chutney, because all I got was chicken in a curry sauce, nonetheless was flavorful, yet one dimensional, could have used that chutney.  Also had the pescador, a fish taco, a bit bland, but in a red cabbage slaw, white sauce and guacamole, the guacamole was a bit brown, I think it was a bit old - not memorable, but we come from San Diego, some of the best fish tacos anywhere!  Hubby had the shanghai and texano, he loved them both.  Good Flavors for a hole in the wall, right across the street from UNLV
8	1	2	2	0	Not much to say about this place. K.O. saw this on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives. We were in the area so we decided to give this place a shot.  Boy were we disappointed. We dont know if this place once had good food but they definitely dont anymore.    ...  ... Texano-dry flavorless meat  ... Pastor-pineapple doesn't belong, flavorless also ... Carne molida-weird flavor, also flavorless ...  ... I wouldnt recommend this place to anyone and would steer clear of this spot.
8	1	1	1	0	This place makes me wish Yelp had an option for 0 stars!!! ... Yayo taco has been bookmarked in my yelp ever since i saw it on Diners, Drive-Ins, & Dives. That is how i convinced Kenny L to go with me. If its on food network... it must be good right? WRONG!!! ...   ... The Pollo was HORRIBLE! As soon as i started chewing, i had to spit it out! ... I was able to eat the Bombay, probably since the curry masked everything. ...  ... I left Yayo feeling guilty about recommending such an awful place and also kinda worried about getting food poisoning from eating that Bombay taco. gross.
8	3	0	0	0	This is a solid fusion street taco joint. It is not amazing and some of the tacos are grody, but some are awesome and I think its great for the give and take that way with different people and family grubbin'. Odd atmosphere for kids, but rock it, it is a good time. First time you go get a couple combos and do not get two of the same tacos. don't be tempted, you need to try them all out to learn your favorite. ... Tough for a business lunch unless is ultra casual, then go for it.
8	3	0	0	0	The food was okay but not what we expected. Sorry Guy , definitely not your best pic. Try again DDD
8	4	0	0	0	Last weekend we were in Vegas celebrating my twin cousins birthdays and decided to go off the stip for some tacos at Yayo Tacos that we saw on diners drive ins and dives. We got there super early to avoid a crowd and were the first people seated. After reviewing the menu we decided to all get the taco special which included four tacos and two sides for $10. Out of the tacos chosen the Shanghai was definitely was the best. The tacos and the sides were  large are very filling. Overall, the food and services was great! Definitely worth a 6 minute trip off the strip and it was nice to get out a the chaos we all experience at some point in Vegas:)
8	4	0	0	0	Had a trip to Vegas so I decided to try Guy Fieri's reco on Diners-Drive in-Dives. Kinda tough finding the place being it's situated in the back of a strip mall right across from UNLV.  ... Decor - college arena, surfboards, graffiti on walls, wooden tables and chairs. I can see this place crazy during UNLV events. ... Had the Pastor tacos per recommended by the cashier. They were tasty but pricey compared to tacos you can buy in ELA.  ... All in all, I'd go again.
8	5	0	0	0	Great restaurant!  It was on Diner, Drive Ins, and Dives, off the beaten path kinda hard to find, no big sign, but definitely a hidden treasure!  I had Jonathan surprise us with our order and it was all exceptional!  The fried plantains were the end to the perfect dinner!  A definite must try!
8	5	0	0	0	We have been in Las Vegas for 4 days and YaYo Taco was hands down the best food and the best service we had. Thank you to Jonathan for the personalized service. Don't let the appearance of the building fool you, This place was awesome. If you are in Vegas make sure you take the time to stop by and grab a burrito.
8	5	0	0	0	Exquisito! The real deal. A real chef. A quality, unforgettable meal.  ...  ... The food at Yayo is fresh, beautiful and expertly seasoned. The flavors are unexpected and over the top delicious. The atmosphere is great fun right down to the music they play and even the beer choices are awesome.  ...  ... This place is a foodies paradise and should be on every food tour of Las Vegas. It is now on mine for any visitors!  ...  ... Yummmmmmmm!  Order the 4 taco combo so you can try a variety from the menu because it is all so good it's impossible to narrow it down to just one dish!
8	5	0	0	1	I feel this is the best place for tacos and beer. Truely unique flavors. ... I live in san Francisco and when I go to vegas I always hit up yayos for my Shanghai taco fix. Its like going to baja with a zen feel..i enjoy that hammock and artful walls too....love love love there food.  ... Wish they had one in s.f. ... Located across from unlv on maryland behind Einstein's bagel. ... If they had ten stars I would give them 10.
8	3	0	0	0	Saw this place on diners, drive-in, & dives and been meaning to try it out. I got the 4 taco combo and 2 sides. Decided to go for the pastor, shanghai, texano, and camarones with black beans and chips & salsa. I was a little disappointed with the shanghai taco. The meat had a smoky flavor that made it taste as if it was burnt. Other tacos weren't bad, but also not super memorable. I wouldn't go out of my way to come back to this place.
8	5	0	0	0	i dont care about anything else but that delicious BOMBAY TACO!!!!!!!! A MUST HAVE!!!!!!!
8	4	2	3	2	I've gone to several Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives restaurants. Yayo Taco is the first place I can truly say was a "dive". That's not a bad thing because the atmosphere was fun. Wish I could be there on a Friday night with UNLV in session. ...  ... I had three tacos (Pollo, Carne Asada, and Bombay.) The Pollo was amazing and I could have eaten several more. The Carne Asada was tasty with a little bit too much spice for my taste. And I'll skip the Bombay next time. Amazing selection of beers, which I tried, and tequilas, which I did not.
8	1	0	1	1	Two groups decided to go get a bite to eat since this was a Food Network must in Las Vegas. One group of four ordered three entrees. The other group of six ordered 6 entrees. We all ordered tacos. All came out one at a time increments of two to 10 minutes. Food wasn't to die for. I did like the Bombay taco. Don't get the refried beans. Horrible! Service was horrible and it wasn't busy. I would be scared to come here when college was in session. You would be waiting for hours! I don't think I will go back. One good thing, it was interesting venue.
8	4	0	0	0	I got the Tacos here once and I. An honestly say I have had better. But the reasons why I give them 4 stars is because their drinks are excellent!
8	3	1	1	0	The waiting is horrible....it took us about 10 mins to order our meal....they need to upgrade the way they take people's orders
8	1	0	3	0	Went here today and the place was closed! I read online that they closed due to health code fines. Too bad i didn't get to try it! :(
8	5	0	0	0	I first heard about this place when it was featured in an episode of triple D (Diners Drive-Ins and Dives).  ...  ... The blend of Mexican meets Asian looked and sounded delicious on TV, so we had to go check it out - and it did not disappoint.  ...  ... The Carne Asada and the Carnitas are both very good. The Tofu Nues is surprisingly delicious, and you don't miss meat at all when you bite in to one of those tasty treats! The sides of fresh fried chips and salsa are yummy, and go down fast.  ...  ... Yayo's is very casual, and the prices are cheap - especially compared to the quality tasting food you get. Great value for money!
8	5	0	0	0	I love yayo. Been going there for years. The tacos are great and inexpensive. The student special makes the cost even better! The bottled beer selection is solid but the selection of tequilas is fantastic - approximately 150. Plus, the staff is real friendly. And don't worry if it looks shut down. That happens every once in a while, but they reopen rat-free in a short time, always.
8	5	0	3	0	Had great food. Now has a "CLOSED" sign on the door.  all the equipment is gone and all the surf boards.
8	5	0	0	0	The place is closed down and most of the interior has been removed. ... Bum Deal, one of the best taco places in town!
8	4	0	0	0	Had the taco sampler which included your choice of 4 tacos and 2 sides. Very fresh ingredients and uniquely done!
9	1	0	0	0	This is not a place you would like to take you pet especially when your pet is sick! I had horrible service while here. Not only did I already feel horrible, sad, upset etc due to my 13 year old dog being in bad shape but the vet was very rude and unprofessional! She came in for less than 2 mins and then never came back. But she went into another room where she was talking to the nurse and didn't realize I can here everything she was saying. She refused to give me a quote to get my dog treated and she was disrespecting myself as well as my pet. If I could give less than 1 star I would but not an option. Instead I took my pet to a different place and they were very helpful.  ...  ... And another thing that should not be done is you should not be on the phone while your with a patient, if not work related. Vet was speaking of being in jail.. That is not work related in one bit. I just want to make sure people and their pets are receiving the best care. Just don't do it here.
9	1	0	0	0	Don't go here. I did for years and I believe that the vet had her own personal health issues interfere with her practice. At one time I trusted Dr. Mceachern, but I truly believe that if I hadn't taken my dog elsewhere for treatment she would have killed him. She overdosed him on two antibiotics and almost shut his liver down. The tech's there are always really nice.
9	5	0	0	0	Where are all the good reviews that used to be here, including mine? Yelp is jacking around with the reviews. Shame on you Yelp. ...  ... Excellent vet, great staff. They've done great with my old dog and my dog with seizures. I've got here since they opened and I'd recommend them to anyone.
9	5	0	0	0	I have experienced 3 vet clinics since purchasing my Olde English Bulldogge. I used to live in central Phoenix and go to Squaw Peak Animal Hospital, which we loved! But unfortunately we moved to the west side. My first vet experience was horrific, but then I found these guys.  ...  ... The staff is very welcoming and helpful. They talk to you and make you feel like they want the best for your fur baby. When my dog is sick, they quickly make an appointment. The front office staff has even flagged down the vet for me as I had an emergency case close to 5 o'clock. (We're talkin 4:55).  ...  ... My previous experience at a vet not far from here was HORRIFIC in comparison. They have a customer for life.  ...  ... I also love the small business feel.
11	4	0	3	0	As far as fast pizza goes, I really like Papa Murphy's. This one even has a drive thru so you can call ahead and just pull up to the window. The staff is friendly and the store is clean. You can go inside and watch them build your pie. ... I really like that I can pick up a pizza and cook it when I'M ready instead of waiting for delivery or having it sit and get cold.  ... The ingredients are good quality and they always have coupons online, making it a very affordable option when you need something quick.
11	4	1	3	2	Great prices, lots of coupons available. Fresh tasty options.
11	4	0	0	0	Great value for good pizza.
11	4	0	0	0	As the name says, they make the pizza then you take it home and bake it.  Interesting concept. ...  ... I think it's a little pricey, but they put on a LOT of toppings.  Their largest size barely fits in our oven (which is a standard wall oven).  But it fits.  They put it on a baking tray for you, but after about 8-10 minutes you want to take it off the tray so the bottom of the crust will firm-up a bit.  You can leave it on the tray, but it will come out limp.  Cooked, but limp.  Transferring to the oven rack resolves that problem.  It is easy to tear the crust doing this, so be careful (or put the tray on a rack below the pizza to catch anything that may drip).  We ripped one because we tried to move it too soon. ...  ... The pizza itself is very tasty.  Toppings seem fresh, and the sauce is good.  And I prefer eating at home anyway! ...  ... There are coupons available pretty regularly (mail flyers and such), which make it a bit less pricey.
11	4	1	2	1	Main points: ... -Decent fast food pizza  ... -Variety of toppings, unique topping combinations ... -Comparable pricing to other fast food chains ...  ... Review: ... It's like Subway for pizza, you go in and order a preset combination of toppings or pick your own toppings, watch them make it for you with their fresh ingredients, and take it home (although they don't cook it for you, you'll do that at home with the instructions). ...  ... I've tried Papa Murphy's at a few small get-togethers, and overall for fast food pizza it's pretty good.  I wasn't too sure I liked the idea of having to bake my own pizza, but it actually works out well when you need to pick up food early to serve later (ex: book clubs, play-dates, casual weeknight dinners, etc.)   ...  ... The main reason I like them is because they have interesting and unique topping combinations including "Hamburger" (with pickles on it!), "Cowboy", and their Gourmet Veggie (white garlic sauce instead of red sauce on base) which is my favorite, and I'm not even a vegetarian!  They also offer dessert pizzas such as s'mores and cinnamon, which are pretty good too. ...  ... If you're looking for something fast and casual, give Papa Murphy's a shot.  With their regular coupons and Tuesday night "any large for $10" deal, it's worth a try.
11	5	0	0	0	Grabbed a family size 1/2 hawaiian 1/2 combo on my way to watch DVDs with the girls last night. What a great crowd pleaser and as always the servers were speedy & courteous.
12	5	0	1	0	Being a woman I don't know much about cars. These guys are very patient and take the time to explain what need to be done and how things work. They also always keep your old parts and show u exactly what needs to be replaced! They are always honest and have gave me a MUCH better price then other repair shops. They will not tell you to replace things you don't need to, but will warn you to pay close attention to things that will need work soon,  also will explain how critical it will be if not replaced on time! Choice is up to you if you wanna be CHEAP or get the things done right!!!! Don't forget your driving a BMW!! If your not ready to keep up with the maintenance BUY A FORD OR A HONDA!!! :)
12	5	0	0	0	Excellent price, excellent service. I will not go anywhere else for service. Victor and his team are very professional and efficient. I've taken my car there on multiple occasions and they always explain what the issue is and the options I have to fix it. They are not pushy like other places I've been to. I truly believe that they have your best interest in mind when they give you the details of your car and what needs be done. What is critical and should be taken care of first and what can wait until next time. For this reason, and for the fact that I've never had an issue after they have repaired it right the first time, I consider them to be trustworthy and recommend them to anyone who is in need of an honest mechanic.
12	5	0	1	0	They have a very good team of certified BMW technicians . There prices are very competitive.
12	5	0	0	0	Forget going to the dealers, these guys really know their stuff and will walk you through what needs to be done and give you HONEST advice. They diagnose problems right away and I know I can always count on them to fix my car correctly. They work fast, efficiently, and offer great prices! I highly recommend this shop to everyone with a BMW!
12	5	0	0	0	Finally they got a yelp! Anyways. I've been coming to these guys for over a year now. I was referred here by a friend(thank Jesus). I initially was taking my car to RG Motorsports(in Henderson) but he wanted $1200 to replace my control arm bushings on my BMW!!!! I get it, I drive a Bimmer. And my dumb ass WAS actually gonna pay that but my friend suggested I go to her mechanic (Victor) and you know how much they charged me? 190 and some change. I just saved 1000 dollars! ...  ... Couple months later, my car overheated. Got EVERYTHING replaced and my car runs good as new and no problems yet.. But these guys are honest guys. They tell you all the things that need to be done on your car. Things that legit needs to be done. Not some BS catalytic converter or whatever I don't know. They also show you what was wrong on the car so that's pretty dope too. ...  ... I appreciate their honesty and loyalty to their customers. And their craftsmanship as well. The price is super right and they'll have your car in tip top shape. Don't go anywhere else! Believe me!
13	5	0	0	0	Awesome location in downtown Las Vegas @ container park on the 3rd floor. Owner is down to earth and easy talk to. He treats everyone like you're part of his LVCK family. I bought the LV Bets Tee, just one of many items that caught my eye. Look forward to going back regularly and checking out what new lids and other gear they have. Make sure you stop here, you won't regret it.
13	5	0	2	1	The store manager is a Las Vegas native and extremely well spoken. He makes you feel right at home with a very polite and courteous approach to how he carries his business. The store is clean and crisp with lots of inventory to choose from. This store is a great addition to downtown and is a MUST VISIT for anybody who's local. REP LVCK!!!
13	5	0	0	0	The owner has done a great job building and creating a culture around this store. The service is great and the selection is even better. You can find a lot of local and out of state brands carried here. Not your typical retail store.
14	2	16	12	7	Not only did a drink from this location give one of my co-workers diarrhea for 2 hours straight, but they always make the drinks wrong and act like you are asking them for their first born when you ask them to re-make it.  ...  ... For $5 my drink better be right damnit! ...  ... Go to the location inside the Safeway at 48th Street/Elliot instead unless you want your ass glued to the toilet seat all afternoon.
14	2	0	0	1	OK, so I guess I will call this the world's slowest Starbucks. And I have to agree with the other Yelper who reviewed this location since they got my order wrong as well. while I appreciate friendly and good customer service, it seems that the cashier was more concerned with socializing amongst her colleagues. I didn't think that "Chai" sounds remotely like "Mocha" ...  ... I still dig Starbucks, especially the marble and pumpkin cakes. I'll just stick to my other spots.
14	3	0	0	0	This Starbucks DOES seem to be a bit slower than most Starbucks, have no idea why though. I would recommend another Starbucks instead. However, a few of the times I've been have been decent. Not one of my favorite locations.
14	1	1	3	2	The service here is horrible!  ... I went in very early on Friday morning and there were pallets strewn all over the floor right inside the door, hello big time hazard. The store looked messy and there was not a smiling face to be found.  ... When I got to the counter the girl behind it looked like she hadn't slept in a week and she was barely functioning. I asked for a peppermint hot chocolate. Without even looking up she mumbled that they were out of peppermint. Huh? Its Black Friday at 5am. Talk about bad inventory management.  ... She was so rude.  ... Starbucks is really loosing me. I would be hard pressed to go into another one anytime soon, but never this location.
14	4	0	1	0	Yes this Starbuck is busy, and yes this Starbucks can be slow. ...  ... But it is the first Starbucks I have gone to that the barista made a great suggestion. I love my Caramel Macchiato's BUT I am tired of my Caramel Macchiato's. And the Barista suggested half Vanilla and half Hazelnut.  ...  ... I love my new drink and I love that she thought to suggest something new. ...  ... That is something I just don't get about Starbucks, they rarely add new drinks to their menu, and I am sure most Starbucks fans are ready for something new! I have my new drink...now I just need to figure out how to order it everywhere...hmmmm
14	3	0	1	0	Just a normal starbucks. I don't like this one as much as the one on rural because it's a lot smaller. Not a great place to study when you are inches away from the line of customers.
14	4	3	4	3	This is my Starbucks.  I don't own it or anything, but it's the closest to my house, so I end up here almost daily. ...  ... Location- a little difficult to get to heading east on Elliot, but otherwise the proximity to the I-10 makes it very convenient. ...  ... Plenty of parking.  The people are friendly and quick- I've never had an issue where I was made to wait. ...  ... One nit to pick- how is it that the Starbucks at Chandler Blvd & 48th (by the Ironwood Library) has marble loaf, but it's "not available for us to order" at this one?  Is this a Starbucks thing?  Corporate versus franchise or something? ...  ... Ah, well, Trenta iced coffee sweetened with milk is my go to drink most of the time; they'll refill it with filtered ice water for free, or with more coffee for $.55.  Personally, though, if you enjoy sleep, I don't recommend more than one Trenta iced coffee per day!
14	4	0	0	0	Every year, maybe multiple times, I travel from Phoenix to Tucson to go from one family to the other. During my drive, it is necessary to have a delicious latte.  ...  ... This Starbucks is in a great location not too far off I-10. It's a good sized store too.

14	3	1	2	1	While the service here is great, huge set back is that there is no drive through :(
14	4	0	1	0	The people here are SO kind! Bummer there is no drive through, but sometimes its nice to go inside. Busy, yes, but what coffee place isn't? They really strive to be quick and have never gotten a drink wrong for me. LOVE that they write your name on the cup, how personalized! Parking is great, tough to get to from Eastbound Elliot but not a huge deal.

14	3	0	0	0	Slow, slow, slow. Over 15 minutes for an iced green tea. Weren't busy and I could see her making it the whole time. Was like she was trying to move through the Labrea Tar Pits to make the tea...
14	4	0	1	0	Okay, so this Starbucks is in no way close to where we live.  I have been here about 3 times before just to meet with our realtor, because it is close to halfway between our homes.... ...  ... So, we were here on Memorial Day at 5:30pm (it closed at 6) to fill out some papers.  We were just sitting there minding our own business, when this man walked up to the counter and he was there for less than 5 seconds, before he started demanding someone help him.  I noticed that one employee was making a drink and the other was helping another customer.  The man at the counter said "Can I get some service" and he was not nice about it at all.  The employee making the drink told him, that he was busy, so hold on a minute.  The man at the counter said " I'm busy too"....The employee finished the drink and helped the man, but the man was still rude to him and continued to be rude until he walked outside. ...  ... When he was outside, he was just sitting at one of the tables with his friends, kicking his feet up....Some hurry he was in.   He was still there when we left. ...  ... I don't understand people.  I give the employee 4 stars for still being calm and having to deal with that.  I am a server at a restaurant and there are times when I want to tell someone off, but have to keep my cool.

14	4	0	0	0	This Starbucks location is very clean. It is always very busy but I would assume most locations are. The people there are always friendly and are masters of their craft. They pump out drinks fast.  Even though the lines may be long they have you in and out of there in no time.

14	5	1	2	1	I love this location!  All of the baristas there are super nice, friendly, knowledgeable and make you feel at home!  They are very personal and they all take time to get to know you as a person.  My favorite barista there is Darren!  Make sure you come in a say hi to him!  They are quick and efficient, especially during their peak times.  The store is always clean and organized.  You will not be disappointed when you stop in here for your beverage of choice!

14	4	0	0	0	This has to be my favorite Starbucks in Tempe. I've become a regular here every morning for their delicious drinks and yummy pastries (donuts and morning buns to be exact). A lovely barista that works there named Leah is such a sweetheart and always takes care of my order, sometimes even before I finish paying, it's awesome. I am a sucker for great customer service. This will always be my go-to 5am Starbucks stop!
14	1	2	2	2	the service here is pretty awful. i thought that maybe it was a one off thing so i came here again today and found the same story.... extremely long lines and incompetent baristas.  ...  ... the store itself is a hot mess. the service bar is extremely dirty, the floor looks like it hasn't been mopped in ages, and there are various spills around the store that haven't been cleaned up. the employees look uninterested or half a sleep and even though there were 6 of them behind the counter today, only 2.5 really appeared to be working at all (and really really really really slowly). of the 2.5 working, the girl at the counter was less than friendly and gave me a blank stare when i asked for my drink (americano). she rung up the coffee and the yogurt i purchased with zombie like speed. eye contact was kept to a minimum because apparently she had an allotment today and couldn't waste any. ...  ... the two behind the bar were just... sigh. the guy working the espresso machines could only do one task at a time which meant that multitasking and getting drinks out was out of the question. he had to stop to steam 1 pitcher of milk then press one button to get some coffee... dude, i know there are two steam wands back there and why dont you have a supply of popular dairy already steamed? that crap goes quick! also, don't make drinks out of order... it pisses people off. when you pick a cup that was just placed there and ignore the 7 already sitting there, you make people want to jump over that counter and take over your job. girl on cold station... she looked extremely lost and couldn't find lids for over 7 minutes (that's why she's a .5 person). disaster. ...  ... i won't be going back to this store and giving them my  money anytime soon. id rather drive over to mcclintock and guad. they have their act together.
14	1	0	1	1	Avoid like the plague. ...  ... Unless you like waiting in a huge line and be treated like garbage.  ...  ... They seriously need to figure something out for this location. I'm done coming here.

15	5	0	0	0	Fountain Bowl is just what Fountain Hills needs!  I love coming here to play whenever I'm in town, and Sam and Diana are the coolest bowl owners/managers I've ever met.  The decor is nice and I love the remodel work they've done with the bowling alley.  Also a fabulous way to get out of the hot Arizona sun in summer and enjoy some AC while sipping Coke and bowling the afternoon away.

15	5	0	0	0	Diana (one of the owners) is FANTASTIC.  This is one of those best kept secret places.  Really GREAT place.  Smaller - which is a nice change - clean, modern, inviting but yet with a fun retro feel.  All ages feel welcome and comfortable here.  Arcade games and those great grabber stuffed animal machines too!  Only suggestion would be to offer some grilled chicken tenders or something for those needing to be more health conscious (Snacks are typical deep fried or candy bars/chips type).  Diana cares about the business and customers and it shows... and it makes for a great customer experience that is worthy of repeating again and again!

16	1	4	4	0	Dear US Airways, ...  ... YOU SUCK!  If I could give you 0 stars, I would.  I only chose your airline from Expedia because it was the cheapest one which brought me from Las Vegas to San Francisco. ...  ... First off, my flight from LAS to SFO on March 7, 2010 was delayed 2 hours.  Upon arriving to your A5 gate, your screens which usually tell your flight number and departure time was not working.  What does a person do to find out the departure time?  Ask a representative!  Her response was "uhh...whenever the plane gets here, the people deboard, we clean and then everyone gets on".  Ummm...really?  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to find that out!  Your customer service SUCKS!   ...  ... I purposely don't check in luggage if I'm gone only a couple of days because you are not Southwest, you are not free.  Apparently, they announce that we're on a smaller plane and the plane cannot accommodate roller luggage, but we can leave them on at the gate and they will check in the luggage at no charge.  Instead of picking up our luggage at the carousels once we got back to SFO, we had to wait in the FREEZING tunnel area once we got off the plane. ...  ... Your tiny plane (a row of two seats on each side) is very unaccommodating.  The lady who sat next to me was not fat, yet her elbow constantly kept going into the side of my arms because we have to sit on the plane like sardines.  You seats are horribly hard and I think I feel the support bar, please upgrade your cushions. ...  ... We were served one drink.  No prezels.  No peanuts.  You want food? You need to buy it.   ...  ... US Airways, unless you pay me to ride on another one of your aircrafts, I will not be flying with you again.  I'd rather pay $20-30 extra and sit in comfort on another airline.
16	2	0	1	0	Our flight was canceled because the airline failed in replacing the pilot. The pilot who was supposed to fill in to fly our flight refused to do so. It shows how poorly the airline manages the resource. The pilots must be pushed to work to their limit so that they cannot take another flight.  ...  ... Also they canceled the flight after they delayed it for 2 and half hours. When we were handled for an over-night accommodation, there was only a person at the ticket counter to re-book our flights and accommodations. They eventually added more people to help the process, but it took a looooooooooooooong time for us to get out of the airport. Then we were sent to a cheap and uncomfortable motel. ...  ... The next morning, we found we had been re-booked to the same canceled flight of the previous day. I don't know how their computer system allows the employee to be able to do something like it. ...  ... We were told there was a good chance to get on to the next morning flight. We went back to the airport only to find it was not true. Then they re-booked us to different flights, which we found out for ourselves. Finally they sent us to United and everything started to work out. ...  ... I added a star because I try to think positively that we had a few extra hours to see more in LV after we went through all of this incident.
16	1	0	3	0	I have had the displeasure of dealing with US Airways for the past week. On May 2nd I flew with them and ended up having to check some things that I was not planning on.  ... After a layover in Phoenix I reached my destination of Las Vegas where I discovered that my laptop, a bottle of vodka, as well as a few pairs of my underwear- were all taken. ...  ... Of course, these are all things that the airline will not cover, but the baggage claim woman had me file complaints anyway. She was incredibly helpful and sorry- I wish I had remembered her name. In the beginning we had thought it was TSA- as they had opened my bag and left a love note in it telling me so.  TSA actually viewed the security tapes so that they could clear them selves. ...  ... US Airways refuses. They keep trying to put the blame on everyone else, saying everything from their baggage handlers are outsourced, to it could have been someone just in the airport. Really? ...  ... With all that's been going on with airport security, DO NOT TELL ME THAT THESE PEOPLE AREN'T UNDER SOME SORT OF SURVEILLANCE.  ...  ... Also, all their call centers are outsourced, so while thats not really the issue they cant really give you any other information unless it pops up on their computer screen. At one point one of them even told me that my items had been located- which was obviously not the case. ...  ... Never fly with these people. Besides the fact that my stuff got stolen they charge for almost everything when you fly, and we never actually encountered a friendly worker on the plane.
16	2	0	3	0	I know that most airline reviews are usually negative, but US Airways don't even try to improve their service. I choose them because they were the cheapest price between Las Vegas and San Francisco. From now on I will pay the extra $20 dollars. We got to our gate with plenty of time and the representative told us the plane was going to arrive early. With 5 minutes before we were supposed to take off the plane had still not arrived. It took another 30 minutes for people to get off the plane and then another 30 minutes to board the plane. The reason for this is that the plane is tiny and they can't even accommodate carry-on's. The problem: they don't tell you this til your boarding. With one representative tagging each bag. When we get off the plane they just dump all the bags in the tunnel and its a free for all. Completely unorganized. Not worth the cheaper flight. Also no room on board and pissy flight attendants.  ...  ...  ... I
16	1	0	1	0	Was supposed to be taking a 230 connecting flight to Philly. Pushed back to 3pm with no apparent explanation. As I'm sitting waiting for my flight, the next gate over (Nevada to North Carolina)  the attendants ask for 18 volunteers to take a next flight due to capacity & plane weight issues. I think what she meant to say is that they overbooked the flight by 18 people. I wouldn't advise anyone to book with US Airways at this point in time. ...  ... Got on the plane from Nevada to Philly which was indeed a half an hour late. We landed in Philly to catch the connecting flight. Plane was late & took a additional 15 mins to open the door to the plane so passengers can exit. Needless to say I missed my connecting flight to NY. The airline staff provided vouchers for a hotel & a next day flight upon plane exit. Tried to see if I could get my checked bags so I could possibly go to NY on my own being that it's only 2hrs away and I didn't want to stay in Philly. Was informed by staff that they didn't have enough man power or staff to release passengers bags. So the only way to retrieve bags would be to take the flight in the morning or drive and go to the LGA to pick 'em in the morning. Not Cool. Ended up staying the night in Philly. ...  ... Not the worst airline experience I've heard of, bur definitely my  worst airline experience.
16	1	0	1	0	Horrible horrible airline. The plane on my return flight could not even fit my carry-on in the overhead luggage compartment. The airline failed to inform me of this before hand. During the flight, the flight attendant managed to skip my row when serving refreshments. I only recommend this airline for quick, cheap, last minute flights.
16	1	1	2	0	This airline is horrible. I made a trip to Mexico and was charged 25 usd for 1 bag. The airline staff told me that only "international flights" were not charged this fee and that mine  WASN'T international because you have to travel "through oceans". WTF ...  ... I asked them if I woud had to pay the fee if travelled to Patagonia, Argentina. I got the same lame response. For US Airways every flight is "domestic" within the hemisphere.
16	1	1	3	0	I flew with us airways about three times in the last few months b/c they were the cheapest at the time. I have to say that my first experience with them was the worst but i caved in on the prices. I've flown american, delta, sw, alaska, jetblue, virgin, ...and more that i cannot remember. Yes i get to my destinations alive, but hours later and feeling awful. Every single flight, including the connecting ones have been delayed without fail. Sometimes they are rude to sometimes, sometimes they ignore you, and sometimes they just keep lying to you about when you're taking off. Don't expect an apology whether you are super sweet or boisterously angry. And if you need their help, yiu might have to ask a couple ppl at the counter before one of them does anything for you. I finally swore them off and I am so happy to fly with other airlines again. Sometimes aa or other airlines come much cheaper, so look really hard to steer clear of US. ...  ... Oh one more thing, the space(seats and aisles) is smaller than all the others as well (except maybe spirit). ... Whew! And done. GL flying!
16	1	0	3	0	The staff of US Airways based in the McCarren Airport was very rude..I've enjoyed US Airways to/from other airports, but I will not fly with them through Las Vegas from now on.
16	4	0	0	0	I flew with US Airways from Vegas to LA.  Flight took off on time and arrived on time.  It was smooth and I had no problems at all.  Only issue I would mention is the $25 bag fee, but you get that with most airlines anyway nowadays.
16	2	0	0	0	For the long flight to and from Philly, I've taken US Airways twice now.  Neither time was I impressed. ...  ... Was it the cheapest option: yes.  And that's how 90% of us purchase tickets, so I doubt the things we complain about will really improve. ...  ... Somehow on US Air, the seats feel even narrower than the competition despite the fact they fly the same 737s and A319s in the same configuration. But, I had no problem with finding overhead space, which is rare nowadays, so that earns them a bump. ...  ... No seatback TVs is a downer on a cross-country flights, no TVs of any kind was a bit surprising (though a relief: if I can't control it, I hate having something running in the background). ...  ... They ran out of food before reaching all the way in the back (though prices were better than the airport to be fair).  But the attendants were helpful, professional, and did a second round of drinks. ...  ... Will I fly them again?  Probably, but if there's a flight on United or better for an extra $30 I'd probably take that.
16	1	0	3	0	This was my first time flying US Airways ever....and trust me, that was my last time. Let me tell you why... ...  ... After a night of partying and getting up extra early to return our rental car and get through security on time, we finally arrive at the airport around 10am. We're relaxing...drinking Starbucks and buying souvenirs until I realized on the Departures List that our flight is delayed by 20 minutes. Not too bad right?? I grab my friend and advise her that we need to get through security just in case! ...  ... We float through security and we reach the assigned gate...and we stop in our tracks! Theres already 50 people in line at the gate! A passenger walks by and says that they're sending people to another gate so I follow him while my friend waits in line. As soon as we get to the gate on the other side of the terminal, a US Airways rep in a thick Spanish accent yells "I can't help you guys. I don't even know why they are sending everyone to my gate. I have to worry about my own flight!!" We all stare at her with our Deer in Headlights look...seriously?? Was she just yelling at us? Shouldnt we be the ones upset? ...  ... I walk away from that gate and I try the next gate to at least get some information about our flight. Another US Airways rep was able to tell me that our plane was stuck in Phoenix due to mechanical problems. Ok well...I walk back to our gate, I inform the passengers around me, and I stick a dollar into a nearby slot machine. And I win $5! Yayyy! Let me tell you...thats the only good thing that happens to me on this day. ...  ... We waited in line for another 30 minutes and the guy behind me suggests that I contact US Airways on my cellphone while in line. I call and Gia was very helpful. She was able to find my friend and I another flight before we even reached the desk at our gate. After another 1 and 1/2 of waiting, the only thing I needed to do was get my new boarding passes and my $5 meal voucher. Yes, you read it right folks! $5 meal voucher!  I feel like a valuable customer now:). ...  ... Then, I had about 15 minutes to grab the blandest sandwich in the world that set me back $10...OOOooo I'm sorry with my meal voucher it was $5. :) And then I had to run to catch my flight!  ...  ... And remember that US Airways rep with the thick Spanish accent, yeah....that *****, I gave her the biggest smile as she checked my NEW boarding pass and gate checked my bag for FREE!!  ...  ... Needless to say, 1st and last experience with US Airways!

16	3	0	1	0	Flew round trip between PHL and Las Vegas on US Airways. ...  ... Flight to Vegas was on time but the flight going back to PHL was delayed by about a half hour. Did not affect me much but others with connecting flights were pulling their hair out. Both flights were overbooked (hate when they do that). ...  ... By the time we got to board both flights of our trip the overhead compartments were FULL so we had to check our carryon luggage. Thankfully there was no charge. Our actual checked bags on the other hand were 25 bucks a bag because we booked last January. I think it's even more now. At least in Vegas they asked ahead of time if we wanted to check our carryons for free well in advance of boarding. In PHL we were almost on the plane when they yanked our carryons away from us.  ...  ... I like non-stop flights and US Airways seems to have them at the best times to fly. Would have liked to upgrade to first class but they have such a limited number on their Airbus planes. Like 4 rows? 16 seats? come on. ...  ... Ended up buying a fruit and cheese platter on the flight. Fresh yes but not even close to being worth 8 bucks.
16	3	0	0	0	I have to give US Airways 3 stars for this trip.  On some others, it would have been a negative rating. ...  ... The two flights--one from Las Vegas to Philadelphia and the other from Philadelphia to Wilkes-Barre--Scranton were both on time. ...  ... Service was pleasant.  We flew first class on the LAS to PHL leg and that certainly makes a big difference.  Lunch was actually quite good and the chocolate cake dessert was rich and tasty. ...  ... OK, US Airways, keep the rating going with my return flight--I dare you!
16	4	0	2	2	Airline travel is a crapshoot.  I've flown every US based airline and they all pretty much have the same issues.  US Airways out of PHL is fantastic as far as schedules and the airport is pretty nice.  Customer service in the airport and on the aircrafts are also like playing lotto.  But then again, this goes for everyone else in the business.  There's a certain airline that loads their passengers like cattle and you couldn't pay me to fly them, yet while everyone applauds them, I've been treated very shabbily every time I've had to use their services. ...  ... I'll stick to US Airways and their convenient flights and prices.
16	4	0	0	0	Nothing fancy or memorable about flying with them, but they do get me to where I need to go.
16	3	1	3	2	This was my first experience traveling with US Airways. We traveled with them on our recent trip to the Dominican Republic with a stopover in Charlotte, NC on each way.  ...  ... I did find them to be a bit more bare bones than I'm accustomed to. No TVs and no meals (unless purchased through the flight attendants, although they really encourage you to bring your own food). They also charge for checked baggage. I know most domestic flights do nowadays, but it's becoming more and more annoying. ...  ... The loading process was not very efficient. This part always seemed to take a lot longer than I'm used to, even when boarding large international flight I have never seen the boarding process this slow. Definitely not one of my favorite airlines I have traveled with thus far.
16	3	0	1	0	Hmm... yeah 3 stars is correct.  ...  ... Once again I procrastinated too long and had to settle with a last min Hotwire deal from Las Vegas to Charlotte, NC, and again from Charlotte, NC to Baltimore, MD.  ...  ... The check-in here in Vegas was pretty easy. All I had to do was go to a little kiosk and enter my confirmation number. Once I did this, I attempted to change our seating arrangement. We booked our flights together and still got seated 6 rows apart. So I changed them and noticed it was going to be a fee of $68 dollars each. Heck, it was only $75 to upgrade to 1st class. I can't make sense of this.  ...  ... We kept our seats and headed to the gate.  ...  ... After boarding the plane and being seated I became more comfortable, probably because I was so tired and the seats gave me decent leg room. I stand near 6'1" so this worked out fine.  ...  ... I didn't stay awake much so I can't comment on what was offered food and drink wise. However I did see the flight crew carrying cans of soda and iced tea before dozing off..  ...  ... ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ...  ... Fast forward to my flight from Charlotte, NC to Baltimore, MD. We boarded on time after our lay over and I felt more awake after my morning meal.  ...  ... Once inside the plane I noticed the seats were not the same, bummer. My next concern was leg room. It was about the same just less cushion in the seat. At this point I was thankful enough I only had 1 more hour in the air until my destination.  ...  ... This time around I made it to the drinks. I ordered a water and that was just what i needed to nap the rest of the way.  ...  ... Overall it was an OK experience.
16	1	0	0	0	My experience was the worst experience I have ever had.  I booked a one way ticket with U.S. Airways through your website. And when I got to the airport i received bad customer service and was told that they were short staff and couldn't help me get my bags to the plane i was on in time. I arrived at the airport in enough time, and even rightly so if they couldn't check my bags they should have made a way for me to take my bags with me. I never received the customer service i received from them before with any other airline in all my travels. I was outraged and they only thing the customer service rep did was change me to a later flight which didn't help me because that was leaving 8 hrs later than my original flight. I will no longer go through U.S. Airways ever again and probably won't book a trip through your website based on my experience. I ended up having to pay for another flight on a different airline and when i told U.S airways that she then proceeded to tell me i was unable to even get back all my money i spent on that ticket to use towards another flight in the future, which just made matters worst. I was very upset at that point and felt like i was taken advantage of. So, not only did i miss my flight and received horrible customer service, but i was also told there wasn't anything they could do to help. This was very unacceptable and I will be writing up a few emails to different travel sites based on my experience.
16	4	0	0	1	Thank you, US Airways! I was able to fly standby on an almost-full flight and the lady at the counter only charged me $50.  I say only, because when I called to inquire about standby, I was informed I would have to purchase another ticket.   ...  ... My spidey-sense told me that was incorrect, so I took a chance and went to the airport in time for the flight I desired and BAM! I was in business!!
16	1	1	0	0	If you have children DO NOT FLY ON US Air.  Period.   ...  ... LAX to Philadelphia (5 hours) on a plane with three small kids and no TV. NO TV?  What?  The flight attendant said, "Yeah...they took them out awhile back...costs...and these days everyone has their own personal device"  (That DIE cause there aren no plugs) ...  ... Sorry.  I could have flown virgin america - personal TV at every seat! for 30$ more per person.  I'd have paid $100 per person just so my kids would not jump, scream, yell or annoy other passengers.  They were so bored.  As were other passengers and flight attendants who had nothing to do either! ...  ... At one point a flight attendant got on the intercom and yelled, "Will the child in Row 7B sit down!"  That was my kid - trying to turn on the air (cause it was stuffy and I refused to get up for the 80th time!).   ...  ... It was horrid.  Worst part, my father-in-law had died so in a couple days I had to book tix to fly for whole family....... I paid $985 per seat to fly on a plane with NO TV's. ...  ... Ugh.

16	2	0	0	0	I've only ever flown usair a few times over the many years and was never really fond of them. My company booked this airline for my trip and I didn't have much of a choice.  Thankfully it was a very short trip. (las vegas to phoenix to yuma arizona)  The airlines is VERY barebones, worse then a low cost airline. They have no monitors on their planes, no entertainment or anything, their gates are always at the very end of the concourse.  When heading home from phx to las  the speaker was too soft in the gate area and people were all gathering around trying to board and the agent was having a hard time controlling the crowd because no one knew what zone they were boarding because we couldn't hear anything.   ...  ... I have never had a desire to fly usair and I still don't.  Hell they are so cheap and so out of date they haven't even updated a few planes and logos and partnerships that STILL show america west airlines (which was a very very good company) and they were bought out in 2005 It doesn't take 8 years to update your stuff.
16	1	0	0	0	I remind myself that USAIR may soon be American, and that's a scary thought.  I've now had three "bad" experiences on USAIR and that's three too many, while American doesn't stick out in my mind for the quality of service.  ... Two experiences on USAIR were pretty egregious, so I should have known that anything is possible, but they had the only convenient flight from KCI to Las Vegas and Phoenix is not a bad place to change planes during the winter. Flying out of the run down looking Terminal 1 in Las Vegas -- and USAIR's are always the farthest from the security lanes --  was a bad start to an otherwise unenjoyable trip on USAIR.  Once on board it was no better, with no video monitors and no beverage service. ... There are alternatives still, and in the future I'll definite consider those instead.  Most recently I discovered that being Silver on United Airlines, entitles me to no perks or preferences when flying on USAIR other than the allowed one checked bag (which I rarely if never use). If I were Silver on USAIR or had a MasterCard or was traveling with a 2 year old yes, but being a frequent flyer on another Star Alliance Member airline wasn't worth very much.  I do like the upgrades available -- for a price -- and First Class travel on USAIR can be pretty luxe.  But as long as I'm a loyal United flyer I'll stick with United when I can.
16	1	0	0	0	DO NOT FLY WITH US AIRWAYS! ...  ... US Airways Flight 4427 ... Philadelphia to Baltimore ... August 8th, 2013 ... Flight Cancelled ...  ... I was not late to my flight, I did not miss the date, I did everything correct. It was -your- airline that created the entire problem by overbooking all flights that came after our cancelled flight that day. The only resolution offered to us that would fly us directly to Baltimore would have been to take a flight leaving -11 HOURS- (9pm) after our originally scheduled flight (11am). That is not acceptable. ...  ... This was the answer I received from US Airways customer service employee Edie Curt: ...  ... "When a customer accepts accommodations to an alternate airport, the customer assumes responsibility for the additional expenses." ...  ... To note here, we did not "assume" the extra expenses. We were given no other choice if we wanted to reach Baltimore in time. We accepted a flight to DC because it was our only alternative that would get us close enough to take public transportation to Baltimore, and to meet our deadline. ...  ... I did ask if we could be provided a rental car so we could drive ourselves from Philadelphia, and that request was immediately denied. As it was, we had to spend our own money for all public transportation from DC to Baltimore so we could meet our group waiting for us in time. This is also not acceptable. It took us FOUR trains to get from DC to Baltimore in unfamiliar territory. Why should this cost be on us? ...  ... This was a second answer I received from US Airways customer service employee Edie Curt: ...  ... "There are no federal aviation regulations concerning what an airline must do to compensate passengers when the carrier delays or cancels a flight. This is true regardless of the reason for the delay/cancellation (e.g., weather, mechanical, crew availability, etc.)." ...  ... So basically because it is not ILLEGAL, they are not required to help their customers in any way. Beware if you are flying US Airways in the future, I would consider otherwise. I have flown on other airlines and I have always either been provided a hotel, food, direct compensation for a future flight or alternate transportation to my exact destination at no cost to myself. ...  ... Keeping the money we paid for services you did not deliver upon is considered theft. Your airline is a poor excuse for a business, and we will never fly with you again. ...  ... Sincerely, ...  ... Anne K.
16	1	0	0	0	I honestly hate this airport. It's simple, that's cool, but all in all I've never had a good flight experience here. ...  ... TSA is... Well, TSA. And there are always too few isles open and a bunch of people. ...  ... The terminals invest more money in slot machines than they do in good food choices and the Starbucks isn't 24 hours.... Smh. Just a bad airport.
16	1	1	0	0	I made reservations for a 30th anniversary trip for my husband and  me, and this airline has one of us in row 5 and the other in row 15!!!!  I called the airline, and the snooty agent said, "We don't have two seats together.  It's only a 40 minute flight.  I'd be more concerned about the other flights on your trip."  REALLY?????  With ALL the airlines out there, you'd think they would accommodate us!  What a lousy, miserable attitude!  I wish I had seen that they only have a 2 star rating.  I never would have booked with this airline!  This will be the last time on US Airways!
16	3	1	2	1	Booked my American Airlines flight with my American Airlines credit card. For that I was supposed to have 1 free checked bag and group 1 boarding. Apparently when it's in the customer's favor the "they haven't actually merged yet with American Airlines". I was informed that since this flight was a US Airways flight I would be charged $25 to check my bag and placed in group 5 boarding. . ... Some positives: All of their flights left on time, the flight attendants were nice (yes, that's unusual when flying American Airlines), and they did not lose my luggage.
16	1	0	1	0	Never in my life have I see such an unprofessional group of people. U.S Airways is absolutely terrible. I spoke with several supervisors Cathy employee identification number 3F and also Vivian ZQ. Both of which I believe gave me the wrong codes but whatever. US Airways is a poor choice to fly with. I also recorded the phone conversation and will be sending to their corporate office! Way to go Vivian. These people refused to help me, told me I was wrong, ridiculed me, mocked, and told me I didn't make sense. They lied to me and told me I was able to get a new ticket and now I am stuck. Jus so you all know, do not fly with US Airways! You will regret it tremendously!
16	1	0	1	0	There is a fee for everything! Any seat you might not want next to the bathroom, curb side check in - 2 more dollars please, 31 dollars for speedy check in, first class upgrade.... they are the typical creepy horrible airline when it comes to talking to them. These guys suck. If someone did what southwest was doing but with assigned seats... they'd take this thing down.
16	3	0	0	0	This is a nice little airport with some food outlets & a duty free service that will send your purchases straight to the gate for you so that you don't have to lug them around with your hand luggage while you pass the time in the airport. ...  ... They also have some fantastically funny staff who were able to calm and cheer up the crowd when our flight was delayed by 30 minutes due to an unruly passanger on the previous plane. Overall a good experience!
16	1	0	0	0	I have never had such CONSISTENTLY poor customer service from any company I have ever done business with! ... Are these employees not trained in HOW to give good customer service, or have they been trained, but just don't give a darn about their customers/passengers? ... Either way, the result is the same... horrendous customer service!  ... Most recently: on my flight the day b4 yesterday, the ticket agent weighed my bag & told me it was "over", then calmly stated, "That will be $100." I asked how MUCH "over" it was & she refused to answer me. I said, "I don't HAVE $100!", & she rolled her eyes & shrugged. Then, the sky cap who had accompanied me from the curb looked @ the scale & ... said, "Just take a few things out- its not much." From the suitcase, I took out a plastic bag with 3 pr of sandals- maybe 2 lbs. & put in my carry-on. The sky cap then told me the weight was fine! Then the bag was labeled & taken by the agent with a scowl! I gave the helpful skycap a second healthy tip 4 saving me $100! ... This time, I was traveling because of a family emergency & had just bought the ticket less than 12 hrs before. I explained this 2her.  However, THEN, this same counter agent refused 2 let me transport my O2 Concentrator without a doctor's letter. I said "Its only being transported, NOT USED, & I did this with NO problem, just months ago, after reading your [US Airways] website re baggage policies." ... Agent says, "You should have read it again. The policy changed the end of April! You can't take it without a doctor's letter."   ... Long story, but IT WENT DOWNHILL FROM THERE...  !!!!!! ... There've been several other instances over the past 2-3 yes, but this time, I traveled alone & clearly have medical issues. I was EXTREMELY frustrated & the agents I've dealt with were without patience (although no one else in line behind me) & without compassion, or even manners. Just plain RUDE!  ... I have never been treated this poorly on any other airline (or business). You can b certain that I will NEVER fly US AIR, ever again, regardless of price. Not worth the hassle!!! ... I hope their recent merger with AAL heralds an improvement. Time will tell...

One of the biggest mistakes I have done in my life.  On 6-24-14 I arrived at HNL airport before the recommended 2 hour time prior to take off.  Upon my arrival I noticed that the plane was already at the gate.  They loaded the first group of passengers and then the gate personnel said that there was a problem with the air conditioning so everyone had to deplane.  This plane was at the gate for over two hours and no one noticed that the AC was out?  We finally take off an hour and a half late.  We arrived at Phoenix and I had to run to my next connection gate.  I barely made my connection flight to Denver, but my carry-on which I was told to check at the gate because there was no room on the plane did not make it.  Upon my arrival at Denver the baggage service agent said that since the bag won't arrive until after three I wouldn't get my bag until after 6:30 pm.  I didn't want to take the chance so I decided to drive an hour and a half back and forth from Colorado Springs and Denver to be sure I got my bag.   ...  ... My return trip back to Honolulu was even worse.  Again I got to the airport two hours prior to boarding.  A plane was at the gate but the gate agent told me that it wasn't my flight.  The gate agent assured me that this would be the gate for boarding.  Half hour prior to boarding the gate agent tells everyone that we need to switch gates then we had to wait another half hour for another plane to taxi out of the gate.  When my flight finally arrived at the gate it was discovered that one of the rear emergency masks was faulty.  Again we have to wait.  We are finally allowed to board on the plane a half hour after the scheduled boarding time to wait another two hours to take off.  First the pilot says they have to refuel then we couldn't take off because of weather.  This caused me to miss my conncection flight to Honolulu from Phoenix.  While I was waiting to take off I get an email from US Airways that due to the delay and me missing my connection flight I was being moved to another flight connecting from PHX to LAX and then to HNL but the flight wasn't until the next day and no mention of them paying for a place for me to stay.  Thank God my wife was able to convince an agent to put me on an American Air flight that would get me back to Hawaii on that day.  Here's the kicker after a stressful trip I write US Airways of my complaint.  You would figure they would give something but you know what I get.  I get a "we are sorry" letter and that's it.  At least United Air was willing to give me a $100.00 certificate for my next travel when my flight was cancelled.  I will never fly US Airways again.  I suggest you all to pay the extra money and fly with someone else.  These guys suck.
17	5	3	2	2	Besides having insanely fabulous cookies (mmm chocolate chip chippers), my glowing review is  more about the catering part of this location. ...  ... I was back in PHX for work and basically used and abused the catering manager (Susan was her name....maybe??).  I'd call her every 5 minutes, needing something completely different, sometimes having my own packaging I'd need her to use, etc. ...  ... It got to the point where I'd call, say my name, the staff would immediately give her the phone, she'd say ok, it'll be ready in 5...and it was.   ...  ... This woman saved my life (well...more my job, but still) and my sanity.
17	4	3	2	3	OK, so Paradise Bakery is a chain restaurant. But, I had lunch there today, so you're going to hear about it. I've had Paradise on several occasions, but this was my first visit to their new Raintree location.  ...  ... Let's cut to the chase. They have the BEST cookies ever! Chewy and 3/4 baked, just the way I like them. And the fact that they include a cookie with you sandwich pretty much eliminates the guilt. There's almost NO chance I'd order a cookie with my lunch. But, throw it in? I'm eating that thing.  ...  ... Before we lose focus, the sandwiches are great. The Tuscan Chicken is phenomenal, but you pretty much can't go wrong with anything you choose. Don't forget the pasta salad. And, did I mention the cookie?
17	4	0	0	0	Very good sandwiches and wonderful baked goods.  Absolutely the best bread I've ever tasted.
17	3	2	2	2	They have the best chocolate chip cookies. You can also buy a giant chocolate chip cookie here for special occasions. I have friends who don't like birthday cake so I get them a giant cookie from here instead.  ...  ... The have decent salads, great muffins and quiche and their Paradise Club is served on a croissant and is quite yummy. It can be pricey for a sandwich, but luckily my office caters lunch for us from here quite often so I get to enjoy it for free.
17	5	0	1	0	I was in Phoenix over the weekend and spent a lot of time at a couple of Paradise Cafes. I mostly had coffee and used the free wi-fi. Great coffee, great atmosphere, a lot of people in the restaurant but not too noisy.
17	4	1	0	0	This is the best breakfast sandwich anywhere! They ruined it for me,  as now they've posted nutritional information on their web site! My favorite Egg sandwich on a "light" croissant with melted swiss cheese and ham which is 450 calories, 29% fat. It's good that I only visit Arizona a few times per year! ...  ... The scrambled egg wrap is a whopping 760 calories.  ...  ... Hmm, I'm staying off the web site and living in denial. 46g of fat in that sandwich???......really???.
17	5	0	0	0	I was on my way back to the airport and decided to stop by here to pick up something to go.  Holy crap...this place is awesome!  I'm usually not a fan of baked goods, but I can keep eating those Chocolate Chip Banana Muffins!  The muffin was really moist and had the perfect amount of chocolate chips and banana.  I also ordered a quiche muffin and it was quite good as well!  I definitely need Danielle to ship me some of those muffins on a weekly basis...I'm still craving them!
17	4	0	1	0	Paradise Bakery is a great place to eat.  Good food, great service, nice employees (at least at the one on Pima/Raintree).   ...  ... They have a rewards card, and that has changed at the beginning of the year.  Yeah I know, kind of late but I forgot that I need to write reviews here, so....sorry. ...  ... It use to be by ten meals and drinks and the the next one was free.  It has changed to by 12 meals, then the 13th is free and they cut out the free drink. ...  ... Now lately they literally measure in a measuring cup the amount of salad that you get.  Before they just put it in the bowl and mixed.  The amount of toppings for the salads has decreased as well. ...  ... So, when you get a salad ask for more of the toppings, they will happily put more on for you.   ...  ... Despite these changes I still like the food, the quality, and atmosphere.   ...  ... So enjoy.
17	4	0	0	0	Ok, what I did leave out is the soft drinks have been cut in the amount of the flavoring that is added.  The drinks are very cut down and you are just able to tell the flavor of the drink.
17	3	0	0	0	I met a friend here for lunch this afternoon. Going to a Paradise Bakery was a regular lunch spot for us back when we used to work together.  The food is fantastic and the cookies are amazing. The big problem for me is the price.  ...  ... My lunch was a sandwich, which comes with a "free" chocolate chip cookie, and a small ice tea. It cost a little more $10. While not exorbitant, still quite a few dollars for a place which is just a step or two over fast food. If I'm paying that much for a drink and sandwich, I would like to have full service. Not order from the counter and have someone bring it out when it's ready.  ...  ... I like hitting Paradise Bakery up once in a while.  If you're looking for good food, it's worth it.  Just be ready to pay a little more for it.
17	5	0	0	0	This is the best Paradise bakery in the valley due to the inclusion of Panera items. If you're from back east you will love having access to your Panera favorites. ...  ... It has the best of both worlds with the great Panera bagels, best entrees from both restaurants, and cookies from Paradise. You will not be sorry you chose to eat here.
17	4	0	0	0	Coooookies!!! ...  ... It's fall and you know what that means: ginger molasses cookies at Paradise Bakery!  Just when you got tired of the lemon cookies (how could you?), they release their seasonal specialty.  Yum! ...  ... But if you must have "real" food, they have a great southwest chicken ceasar salad with enough spice to make you guzzle a couple cups of mango iced tea.  Their sandwiches are pretty good, and I'm partial to the turkey with cranberry or the chicken walnut.  Bonus?  You get a cookie for FREE!
17	4	0	0	0	This is basically the "Panera Bread" of AZ IMO. Great mac 'n cheese. Yummy sandwiches and a great massive customizable salad bar. And it's a pretty large space with lots of seating and menu options.
17	5	1	1	1	IF you can get in here you will love it! Be warned the Breakfast and Lunch rush can get mobbed. They offer a lot of different options and all that I have tried are excellent.
17	2	1	0	0	The food for the most part is the same but the portions are getting smaller (a kids fruit cup had 2 pieces of fruit) and prices seem to be going up...
17	3	0	1	1	Paradise Bakery is one of those places where we use to go at least once a week or more. The cookies are great and the food is very interestingly prepared, BUT with the recent menu changes the quantity of the meats and therefore quality of the food has gone down.  Sorry! I really want to like this place.  ...  ... For example, my family came here recently for lunch and for the three of us the meal cost $33.35. That is one full sandwich, and two 1/2 sandwiches with soup or salad and some cookies to take home for later. My sandwich had only four thinly slices of meat and cheese.  At what point does the lack of substance outweigh the interestingly prepared food?  Like I said I want to like this place, but they're not making it easy.
17	4	0	0	0	I really like this place and it seems to be the place to network. Everyone that works there is really nice and quite accommodating. It is kept clean, especially for as busy as it gets. If there is one problem it would be the parking...busy times it can be hard to find a space. Worth a try though.
17	2	1	1	1	Okay been here a couple more times and think I need to update. Of all the places to go this is now maybe my fourth choice. If you are meeting someone, go early to get parking otherwise you'll be later than you expect. The menu has changed and it doesn't rank as high as before - just okay, breakfast is poor and lunch depends on the day. The staff on the floor are hard working and keep it clean, the staff behind the counter is mixed. Some are cordial and others act as if waiting on you is a bother. It might be a networking place to be seen, and it seems to host cliques as if holding court...but it has lost the luster for me.
17	5	0	0	0	Great sandwiches and salads. Very fresh and clean. Every location is very good and consistent with food preparation and presentation. The cookies are great too. Very good place for family and casual dates. The prices are very reasonable and portions are a good size.
17	5	0	0	0	Never got around to adding my review.  What great tastes and wholesome food in a clean place for a great price. *****
17	4	11	9	12	I had never, ever been recognized because of Yelp...until a few days ago! ...  ... I was frankly concerned that the first time someone recognized me because of Yelp, it would be in connection with one of my less "flattering" reviews. ...  ... And I take very seriously, the old adage "never mess with people that prepare and handle your food"! ...  ... So I was surprised and delighted (and more than little relieved) that my "first time" was with Jennifer, at this Paradise Bakery outpost! ...  ... Jennifer was sweet and friendly, she was even complimentary about my humble attempts to create interesting reviews! ...  ... I not only appreciate her reading my little stories, I really appreciated her saying "Hi"! ...  ... The Beautiful Carin and I used to frequent this PB when we lived in Scottsdale Mountain, but I hadn't been here in some time. ...  ... We would have a croissant or a muffin and drink refill after refill of PB's very good coffee, read our Sunday papers and plot and plan the week ahead. ...  ... It was and is a great spot to just hang out! ...  ... One of my clients suggested it as a place to meet...and since they have pretty decent baked goodies, good coffee, free wifi and, of course, Jennifer (and a lot of nice people like Jennifer helping you at PB), I said "why not". ...  ... Have you noticed that almost no one (including me, BTW) meets at their offices anymore...or at least rarely? ...  ... Out of 8 client meetings in Phoenix this week, 3 were at an office...the rest took place at a coffee shop, or a restaurant, or on a park bench late at night (OK, I'm kidding about that last one...probably). ...  ... This location is my favorite of all the PB's (and judging from my PB Frequent Flyer Card, I have clearly been to nearly all of them, so I think I'm qualified to judge). ...  ... Drop by, grab a Lemon Poppyseed Muffin (unless you have a drug test scheduled for later in the day), a bottomless cup of coffee, fire up the iPad and make this place your office away from the office. ...  ... And say "Hi" to my new friend, Jennifer!
17	4	2	3	4	A cafe is a cafe is a cafe....right? Well, yeah. Of course. ...  ... On Friday, I had to run a quick errand in the area, and popped in for lunch. Service was pretty fast. Picked up a delicious ham and swiss sandwich on multigrain bread.  ...  ... Everything came out as ordered, and relatively quick. Very tasty. The meat wasn't slimy, the cheese was perfect, and the veggies were crisp and delicious. Just a hint of mustard. It was the kind of sandwich that made my afternoon.  ...  ... Also, I got a free chocolate chip cookie. Everyone gets one. Usually I get free stuff because I am quite the charmer, but you can feel special here. The staff is very nice. Friendly. ...  ... The Iced Tea selection is pretty cool too! ...  ... My lunch was a touch on the pricey side. About nine bucks. Oh well. Who cares. At least it was worth it. ...  ... I'm coming back to try some of the other sandwiches too. If you want to see what mine looked like, check out the picture I uploaded. ...  ... Over and out.
17	3	0	0	0	Paradise's prices have always gotten to me, on the high end, but the salads are tasty and seem reasonably priced at this location when I compare it to salad offerings at other nearby places (Bagel Nosh - yuck!).  However, for the price of a whole salad, why no cookie?? ...  ... I am disappointed that they took wraps off the menu and they moved away from the iced teas they previously carried, especially the peach.  I don't care for the new offerings.
17	3	0	0	0	If you eat lunch out in the Metro Phoenix area, chance are you've had PB, and know the food definitely good. ...  ... That being said, this one gets a lower rating for service. I used to order lunch from here on a daily basis for my office (take out). My boss is obsessed with soup and sanwiches for lunch, and we are up the street, so this was the obvious place. I swear they messed up my order almost every single time. Everytime it was a wrong item, wrong modifier, wrong amount of cookies, forgot an item altogether,etc. I can memorized about ten orders in my head and check them for accuracy when I get there. I just dont understand why they cannnot do the same given they are in the lunch biz, enter the order in thier computer, and read it back to me mulitple times! ...  ... We finally moved on to other soup/sandwich locations in the area, and most of them have much better accuarcy. :) ...  ... They have some menu items at this location that are different than others, and they are good so that is a plus. Also, if you are at any PB location, pick up a box of black and white chippers! They are fab.
17	4	1	1	1	Lots of menu items that aren't available at other PBs.  Everything tastes good.  Wish they had a green iced tea option.
17	5	0	0	0	Love this place. Love it.  ...  ... As with most places in the Raintree/FLW area, during lunchtime it gets superduper busy. They have a good layout, and a TON of seating, so this location doesn't get too bad. They always have a friendly greeter handing out cookie bits while you wait in line, and the line moves quick. The menu is well laid out (better than other Paradise locations) and the food is top notch. ...  ... Their side (overflow) room is great for seating a group of people, and they have a tv in there too (unusual for Paradise). Couldn't be better. Plus they have free wifi. Bring the laptop and stay a while. ...  ... Only complaint is that its a tiny bit pricy, but considering what you get, its worth it. Half salad, half sandwich, drink and a cookie (best part) is around $10.
17	3	4	3	3	I've struggled with a rating for this place for a long time and would give it a 2 1/2 stars but will round up to 3 stars since the 2 1/2 rating isn't available. ...  ... My sons had the ham and cheese sandwich and I had the Smoked Turkey Panini and my wife had a 1/2 chicken salad sandwich and a salad. The food was good and my wife really enjoyed the salad.  ...  ... The Smoked Turkey Panini was A-OK, but pales when compared to a Panera bread. For example, the bread was not completely toasted on the outside. In other words, one side of the sandwich was white bread without that grilled look of a panini sandwich. My Wife's salad was delicious, the salad included walnuts, mandarin oranges, blueberries, regular lettuce, etc. and a very tasty salad dressing. ...  ... The total bill was $33.13 for 4 people without drinks. We were initially given 3 chocolate cookies for 4 people; we were given 2 sugar cookies after we alerted them of their initial shortfall. I guess they ran out of cookies.
17	5	1	1	1	Paradise Bakery owns my heart. All their food is so good and its not too pricey. The employees have always been very friendly and very quick. This place gets pretty busy around lunch time, but there is extra seating that they can open up if it does get to busy. Great place for sure!
17	3	0	0	0	This is a decent lunch spot - good sandwiches and good selection of other items.  However, it is also a great place to hang out with friends.  The staff will let you stay all day - play cards, work on the computer, you name it.  On afternoons there is a whole room of people just playing games.  They have free wifi, ample space and great warm baked treats
17	3	0	2	2	I want to give this place more stars, really I do.  ...  ... But last time I went, I asked for my salad to go and wanted a half salad but it looked like it was only half of the half salad.  ...  ... Also, I can never seem to find a fork when I need one. Last two times I went, I had to have staff behind the counter grab a fork for me. I know it gets busy and understand but majority of people are going to have salad with their meals and we need a fork.  ...  ... Maybe when I go, it's off days for me because I know my friends love this place.  ...  ... I will give it another chance.
17	5	1	2	0	I wanted to update my review based on my last experience. ...  ... As usual, I ordered a half salad and decided to get the southwestern Caesar. I asked for onions and the nice guy behind the counter happily put them on top of my salad. The salad for a half size looked awesome. I also decided to try their baked potato soup and some sugar cookies for the fun of it. ...  ... All I have to say is everything was great! Salad was filling, soup was soo good I didn't want to stop eating it but had to because I was full. And the sugar cookie was one of the best I have had. I also was able to get a fork and noticed they were not lacking available utensils like the last few times.  ...  ... I left a very happy camper.
17	3	0	1	0	I use to love this place...would do anything to go there; but since they changed their menu...I just don't like it as much.  Their portions are tiny and their price increased...how does that happen?!?! ...  ... Anyway, I am sure you can find a number of other places with better food close to any Paradise Bakery...
17	2	0	1	0	Salads/Sandwich's are decent/Good, Desserts are what makes them stand-out. The wait during rush hour (lunch) is a joke. Feel's like a grade school cafeteria line. Guys/Gals with there briefcases who need too much room and think there overly important. And the best part you ask? The parking lot is a cluster, And with this location being so busy you think Paradise would come to there senses and move to a more suitable/larger building. Also, only two stars because price wise should be cheaper IMO
17	3	0	1	0	I'm a regular, mostly out of convenience.  The food is good and fresh and made to order which I really like.  The menu selection is pretty vast however I usually stick to the half bbq chicken salad which I can't get enough of. ...  ... The prices have gone up a little bit in the past few months but still a good deal.  Service is pretty spot on here unless you go at the lunch rush, which then is just madness.
17	1	2	3	4	This place ALWAYS sucks. Waited 10 min in the only line to order a scone. Once I got to th head of the line, the guy behind the counter told me he couldn't get it for me but he'd get someone who could. Really, you can't put a scone that's 10 feet away in a bag? But you can walk about 40 feet and go through a door for 2-3 minutes to get someone else to do it while we all continue to wait? So anyway, he comes back out and takes next person in line while I wait 10 more min for someone to finally come out from the back (seriously I timed it). Then that person told me she had to make sandwiches first. Seriously? Put a scone in a dang bag. So at this point I left irritated because of 20 min wait & still didn't get the scone I came in for. Instead I drove up the street to Wildflower where I was in & out with a scone in 4 minutes...with a line. Take note Paradise, this is one reason why Wildflower is so much better than you (aka you suck). Paradise is more like Paradise Lost...I won't be back.

17	3	0	1	0	This Paradise location is one of the noisiest locations I have ever been to. Keep that in mind if you are planning a lunch business meeting. Otherwise the service is great!
17	4	0	1	0	Went here for something sweet after the bar.  The young lady behind the counter recommended the cream cheese brownie.  My goodness this was beyond amazing.  Incredibly sweet but not too sweet.  Tasted very fresh.  Considering I was coming later in the day this is never a certainty.  Plus the brownie got it;s on little box, which was just a nice touch.
17	3	0	0	0	I've been to a few different Paradise Bakeries before and this one is no different. You can either call ahead or wait in line. Sometimes, waiting in line is worth it as there's this really sweet lady who walks around handing out fresh from the oven cookies. I normally order a sandwich (bacon turkey bravo) but their soups and salads are good too. I like their french onion soup the best and the roll that comes with it is a perfect accompaniment. The food is consistently good and the employees are generally friendly and accommodating. The one thing I don't like is the location. Sure, it's close to work and is perfect for lunch, but the parking is atrocious. It's difficult to get in, it's difficult to get out, and good luck finding a space! I'd recommend coming either before or after the lunch rush.
17	1	0	0	0	I used to love the Turkey Cranberry sandwich.  It has changed for the worse.  Now just a couple of crappy slices of turkey that look like something from the back of my fridge.  The cookie quality has declined as well.
17	5	3	3	2	The awesome catering manager I was talking about is still there...and still awesome! ...  ... Catering orders $50+ they will deliver for a $10 fee. Ask for a catering menu and they'll include a 10% off coupon for orders $100+. ...  ... Love the staff!  Clearly they enjoy their jobs!
17	4	0	1	0	Walnut chicken sandwich is my favorite here! AND it comes with a chocolate chip cookie!! Awesome :)
17	3	2	0	0	I'm not going to lie to you, I'm not a fan of Paradise Bakery. I think it's expensive, pretentious, foods no good, and just the epitome of everything fake and bad in Scottsdale.   ...  ... But I do have to say, I have invented the best dang sandwich Paradise Bakery could possibly make for you. Check it out, it's simple. Ham & Swiss on a croissant! Also get it without that crumby mustard sauce they wanna put on it. Just croissant, ham, Swiss, mayo, and regular mustard and this is basically the best sandwich the PB can make you! (But fair warning, it will be expensive.)  ...  ... Also I want to say that their croissants are not even that good. When the dude you work with starts telling you how PB's croissants are "to die for" you immediately tell him he's a momma's boy for saying that horse trash and then call him out on the internet. That's right, I'm stating that these croissants are a'ight and since I did it right here on Yelp, I freakin' win because someday in the future some kid is going to be writing his research paper on Paradise Bakery and come across my Yelp account and he'll be all, "and they had a'ight croissants!" (Spohn, Yelp).   ...  ... I need to get another thing off my mind, this sandwich didn't come with that pasta salad. You have to pay extra for it and it's like $5 or something. Meanwhile the sandwich comes with a cookie was like $9 and then a drink was like $3, so seriously, this was a $16 or $17 lunch! Funk that!!! Don't buy the pasta. It's not that good or worth it. $5 could feed a college student Ramen noodles for a month.  Also let's talk about the cookie. Ya'll are on crack thinking PB has the best cookies. They're not even cooked all the way and not in the that, "Yum! so soft and fresh way," but like they are straight up, not even done cooking way. Cookies suck yo.
17	4	0	0	0	Clean, quick, good service and excellent salad/sandwich options.
17	1	0	2	0	BEWARE- Food Dye in soup. Only 2 of their soups were labeled AN - 'All Natural.'  Hmm... So what makes the Tomato Soup not receive the all natural label? Of course I asked - seemed to be the shift manager that day in the salad bar area said she would check for me (but acted quite annoyed to have to go through the process). I did not want to bother anyone but if I am going to be eating something - and/or feeding it to my child, I would certainly like to know what the heck is in it. She let me know that the Tomato soup has Red and Blue Food Dye. Seriously Paradise??? Have they never seen the studies that Food Dyes are dangerous for kiddos? It is really frustrating when businesses advertise something that is seemingly healthy-ish (don't get me wrong I assumed there was some cream) - but really they are throwing scary additives.   Moral of the story - visit the local restaurants who make things from scratch, and don't need to dye their tomato soup to make it red. Tomatoes are red!
17	4	0	0	0	I really enjoy this location, it's really huge.  Service is fast and consistent.  Like all other Paradise locations, there's a great variety of menu items. ...  ... The only real downside to this location is that parking is simply awful during the lunch rush in the middle of the week.
17	3	2	3	2	Stopped in for a bite of breakfast and a coffee with the kiddo.  They'd been open not very long but the selection on the pastries was slight.   ...  ... Coffee was great, the breakfast sandwich was fine (but a tad greasy), but I still expect more, I guess.  I worked for PB when I was younger and I just don't feel like (on this day at least) it was up to par.
17	1	0	0	0	Disorganized and inefficient.  Waited 20 minutes for a sandwich, name called, confirmed my order, and I drive 10 miles home.  Wrong sandwich.  Call them up, and told I can come back and pick up the right one!  I guess that if you spend your money at this location, be sure to unwrap and physically inspect the sandwich before leaving property.
17	1	0	0	0	Not impressed... The staff was not very courteous. I ordered a turkey sandwich with lettuce, tomato, provolone, mayo and mustard... Ended up with a Turkey, Bacon and Cheddar Panini. Swing and a miss... Nice try. It's a good thing I asked for the extras like mayo and mustard, because they aren't going to tell you what comes on it unless you ask. The salad didn't seem to offer up a lot of vegetable options, mostly different lettuces and lots of dressing, bacon, cheeses and such.  The bread was soft and cookie was nice... Not really worth the money though.
17	5	0	1	0	This location is close to my work and that makes it an easy one to go to for lunch.  They are always quick to get food ready, which is nice if you are in a hurry to get back to work. The staff always seems to be friendly and welcoming as soon as you walk in the door. ...  ... Their mac and cheese is addictive - you've been warned! The cookies are buy one, get one free and the chocolate chip is my favorite one to add to a small order of the mac and cheese. ...  ... There is a decent amount of parking since this location is in a strip that has other stores.  I would recommend trying to go on off lunch times (early or late) in order to avoid the rush - but that applies everywhere, right? ...  ... Overall: A  ... Yay mac and cheese and cookies!
17	4	0	0	0	I'm not the biggest fan of Paradise Bakery. Only because it's so busy when I go in there around meal times. However if you get there really early in the morning it's empty and everything is fresh and warm. The employees are really nice people. In fact I came in and bought the chocolate babka so often that on their last day of serving it (it was seasonal) the manager David gave me a whole babka cake on the house! So rad.
17	3	0	0	0	I'm here at this moment. Not too happy with the lack of service. I was standing in one of 3 unmarked lines, had 2 women blatantly cut in front of me and the girl at the register helped them anyway. I then walked over to a different register to ask where I could pick up my order, my office ordered lunch earlier and it should be ready. The girl at the register saw me walk up to her and wait for her to give the customer her change,but instead of asking me if I had a question she just beckoned over the next person. I made eye contact again and told her I just had a quick question. I was told to sit and wait to be called, then I had to restate I called in the order earlier, I was then directed back to the first line (the one I was cut in) long story short I saw our bag of food the whole time but for reasons within their control, I waited 10 minutes just to pick it up. Management should put up a sign or rope to fix the multiple line issues and rude people who think their lunch break is more valuable than others'.

17	5	0	0	1	I love paradise! This place has the best food and great service! Any time I go in the restaurant the workers are always very polite and friendly. It makes a huge difference when employees actually care.
17	4	1	1	1	My favorite thing about this location is Stacy, she's always at the door to greet you and hold the door open on your way out. If she wasn't at the door I don't think there would ever be a straight line in that place. I love her friendly personality. She always asks how my weekend was or what's new.  ...  ... The rest of the staff is hit or miss. Today I stood waiting for soup for a really long time while those making salads stood there chatting, I counted 6 folks not doing anything while I stood there waiting. Finally the cashier came over, apologized and scooped me some soup.  ... This happens often, no one is very attentive. The food is always consistent but service isn't. ...  ... I often get the Greek salad with no olives. So I tell the first guy no olives, then he hands the box with lettuce to the second person and says greek with no olives, she repeats "greek with no olives" then puts olives in the box. I then have to tell them I don't want olives and they always seem surprised despite the fact they repeated my order. This happens ALL THE TIME. It's similar to when I ask for soup to go and they ask if it's for here or to go, I tell them to-go and they put it in a regular bowl. There's not loud music. The staff just doesn't pay attention.

Let's see what PB&C can do for me...Nothing, out of luck, can't do a thing or give me credit on the ELoyalty card I have with me. So Karen and I sat down with our coffee and we're enjoying each other's company. Then Karen says why don't you ask the manager? So I did and he was all smiling and happy to see my old loyalty card. He gave me some terrific choices and I'm no dummy so I chose chocolate chip cookies. I thought oh, sweet, a cookie for me and one for Karen. Then I nearly fell at his feet when he said, How about a dozen? I'll go bake up a fresh batch for you!"  ...  ... My hero, I was so shocked I didn't get his name, but he's tall and good looking with a black curly, well groomed beard, which I normally don't care for, but on this guy it was  darling! I really want to introduce him to my daughter! Thanks so much!!
17	3	0	0	0	I gave 3stars because the food is great but the service is wack!  ... I'm from Chicago-love Panera Bread; so when I learned Paradise Bakery was owned by Panera I figured I'd give it a try.  ... The place was packed (we went at lunch rush). No one told us that you had to go to eat counter to order(bakery, sandwich, salad & soup). So we stood in line only to be told we were in the wrong line. Once we got to the salad counter, I told the girl I wanted the Greek salad; she corrected- "you mean the Mediterranean salad?" I told her "no, the Greek salad-the one thats on the menu." Although its "the same" i didn't appreciate that she tried to correct me. ... No one asked if we wanted soup so when we got to the soup counter no one was standing there so we asked a salad girl for soup and she told us the wait. We did....a cashier got it for us. The other cashier who rang us out was so impatient.  She rang me up and told me the total. I told her my order wasn't complete I was waiting on my husband's food. She rolls her eyes and tells me to step to the side. ...  ... Two days later I went bake to get one bagel.  As I walked in the pastry girl was ringing out someone then walked away. As I stood there I asked the sandwich guy if he cud get me a bagel or if I had to wait for the girl to cone back-he told me I had to wait. Their were no other ppl in line so I was ticked. As the sandwich guy stood there waiting for ppl in the sandwich..I watched as the pastry girl walked slowly over scratching her ears. She gets to the counter and tell her what I want, but asked for her to wash her hands again.  She did. By the time she bagged my one bagel more ppl came in, so I was now the 7th person in line...she handed me my bag and began walking away. I called out can you ring me out over here?  She turns around and says sure. Question why did I have to ask for her to ring me up if I told her i only wanted one bagel? ...  ... Didn't like the ppl. Food was good. Wont be going back to this location
17	2	1	0	0	I was a former Paradise Junkie.  The last few times I have eaten here the service has been poor and the food quality is hit or miss.  Today was no exception.  The girl taking orders for salads was so rude I literally just walked out.  If I'm paying $10 for a salad I want to at least be treated politely.
17	2	0	0	0	A little annoyed with this place. I checked when they closed to see if I could make it in time and I got here at 8:50pm when they close at 9pm and the doors were already locked. I called them to see if I could quickly buy something (only wanted to buy a chocolate chip cookie) and no one picked up. Basically very disappointed with the customer service and I will be finding somewhere else to buy the odd cookie. You just can't close early on Shrove Tuesday... All I wanted was one last indulgence before lent.
17	1	0	0	0	Total Rip-off at the one on Indian School Rd, so I assume they're all like that!  ... I ordered a flatbread Med Chicken sandwich with 3 small, mealy pieces of chicken and so little humus that you couldn't even scrape any of it off. It was 4x flatbread with very little filling. People who worked there were nice though - must be mgmt greed. ... Eat at PF Chang's or Buca di Beppo if you want better and more food at a reasonable cost!
17	1	2	0	0	I'm done with this particular location.  Customer service is beyond rude and I feel that if I'm paying $10 for a salad, you should at least have a smile on your face, fake or not.  This rude little girl (yes, if you act an ass as an adult you are nothing but a child to me) had the worst attitude ever.  You would have thought I asked her to grow the harvest for the salad I asked for.  I always order off of the menu because I can't stand when people have complicated orders, I just asked for no bleu cheese in my Cobb salad. This girl made it seem like an inconvenience.  I'm also pleasant to people who are making my food even when I can see you making it.  I said thank you and she gave me no eye contact or a your welcome.  She just handed me the hot ass bowl and moved on.  I'm pretty sure if I was not well in the head, I would have tossed that salad right back at her burnt burgundy haired ass but I didn't.  But best believe, they won't be getting my business ever again
17	5	1	1	2	Everytime I come to this place I ask myself why I don't come more often... ...  ... This is the definition of a lunch spot- they have soups, salads and hot/cold sandwiches- so if youre having trouble picking what you want- they have a pick 2 option that can save the day. ...  ... The service is good and works hard to keep the lines moving because when I'm in here they are in an extreme lunch rush.  ...  ... To cap it off at the end of a good meal you can indulge in a freshly baked cookie of your choice- so make sure to save room. ...  ... Paradise Bakery is a winner!
18	4	0	0	0	I have been coming to this Starbucks quite a bit and for a long period of time. It is a nice quiet and smaller Starbucks on the west side. They always have everything brewed on time and they get your order quickly. It's generally cleanly and have some nice coffee-related products always stocked generously. The only thing I dislike about this particular store is the seating. For some reason people go there and take the bigger tables for just one person or take up one of the "comfy chairs" without purchasing anything just to sit... I know its a free country but come on... anyways, It is still a place I come back to regularly and probably will always.
18	3	0	0	0	I'm not a big coffee drinker, but when I am coerced to go here by coffee drinkers, the Passion Tazo iced tea is so juicy and delicious. Free Wi-Fi also makes me happy.
18	5	0	0	0	Cute corner shop across form the mall.  ... Consistent service like you would expect from Starbucks.
18	5	0	0	0	Cafe vanilla frap with a banana in it!!!! Delish
18	3	0	0	0	I come in to read the paper and get coffee on Sunday mornings.  I have had pretty good service here during my past visits.  The partners are friendly, know the product (a result of the excellent training they get), and are willing to make drinks that had been on the menu but are no longer on the menu with similar ingredients.  Today was different.  The one working at the counter was probably 10 to 15 years older than most of the baristas and she sure was short tempered.  She tried charging me the full $2.50 for the paper, when it's only $2 at Starbucks.  She also didn't manage the line well.  The barista who may have been a supervisor told her to charge me the correct price and was far more pleasant.   ...  ... What bought it down to three stars was an older woman pushing a walker sitting down across from me without even asking me if that was okay.  First, she's old enough to know that it's polite to ask someone if they are fine with you sharing a table with them.  She ignored my body language which indicated it was not okay and plopped her butt down and tried to make conversation.  I wanted to be left alone and she didn't get the hint.  I know there is limited seating but she didn't have to be so rude and oblivious to the fact she wasn't welcome.
18	1	0	1	0	I enjoy and occasional Starbucks Coffee and with the onset of fall, of course the Pumpkin Latte.  Recently I gave this location a couple visits and I'm not impressed.  One visit was around 8:30 a.m. on a weekday and the line was crazy long.  We turned around and left.  Good for them for being busy. ...  ... On a second visit, once again a morning, I powered through the line, waiting more than 15 minutes to order.  When ordering the staff was less than friendly.  I have been testing the new Starbucks Rewards program.  It is a bit confusing.  I have it on my smart phone and I also get offers now that I am enrolled.  I let the person know I had $2 off a sandwich.  She said "do you have a code?"  I said no.  She said "well you have to have a code.  I can't redeem without a code.  Hurry up there's a line."  I said OK I may have deleted the email and I chalked it up to my fault.  I then went to pay with my phone app and the person said "I'm new, I don't know how to use that.  We can't scan that."  Once again rushing me.  Befuttled I paid with cash and waited in line for my coffee to be served.  I do appreciate the staff might be stressed but it does not give a warm fuzzy to me when it's implied that I'm the problem. ...  ... If you are in a rush, this is not the place.  I've been to the Target and Hy-Vee locations which are rarely, busy.  Better yet, local owned places are more friendly. ...  ... Based on multiple experiences I'll remember to go elsewhere.
18	2	0	0	0	The staff has been pretty good here for the most part but the seating area is awful and gotten worse.   Recently went there to relax before an appointment.  It was cold outside but I didn't expect it to be cold inside.  I wore my coat the whole time as it was quite chilly and they took out the nice upholstered chairs and put in stools and wooden chairs.   Up front there are just tall barstools.  Not a comfortable coffee shop.   Also the coffee is hit and miss for flavor.   it wouldn't take much for a new coffee shop to move in and take away the business from them.   Any takers?  Please say yes.
18	2	0	1	1	It's a typical Starbucks as far as workers and drinks go.  The location is very high traffic so it's tough to find parking and seating sometimes. ... The reason I give it two stars is because the majority of the seating is surrounded all by huge windows. I was there for a business meeting a week ago (and it is winter in Wi, so I'm used to the cold), but the windows were so drafty it was freezing by the seats.  I left my winter jacket on the entire time and was still cold. It's great in the summer, but very uncomfortable in the winter.
18	3	0	0	0	I normally don't go to Starbucks because I do feel that it is overpriced, but my wife and I had some time to grab a drink before we had to be somewhere. I got the mocha frappuccino while my wife got the caramel. They were very good, but as other reviews have said, the sitting area is very small.
18	4	0	0	0	Came in this morning and was greeted by a very friendly employee at the counter with a "Happy Wednesday!" A very good greeting for first thing in the morning, especially since I didn't have my coffee yet! ...  ... The store was clean and the employees kept the lines moving. Was impressed all the way around!
18	5	0	0	0	I typically prefer locally owned, independent coffee shops, but the reason I come back to this particular Starbucks is because of the staff. The baristas have all been incredibly kind, courteous, and patient with customers--including myself--and even though I usually steer clear of corporate cafes, I now make it a point to duck into this location whenever I'm on the west side of Madison for work.
19	5	0	0	0	This place has been in the valley since my Dads family first moved here and it has always been delicious and reasonably priced. It's best to order your food and pick up later however since the resturant tends to be quite noisy. It is Definitely worth the drive (glendale area).
19	5	0	3	0	Popo's is not a place you know about, but one of those places someone takes you to.   I've been going for 10 years now with my fellow co-workers.  When we go we could all order for one another.  My choice is almost always the Machaca taco and a side of beans.  Don't forget to ask for the "hot" salsa as well.  My company has taken every President or Vice President that has time for lunch to this establishment when they visit Phoenix.    They have all been impressed.  That's saying a lot when you work for a fortune 150 company and your visitors travel extensively.    This is truly a hole in the wall worth visiting.  Oh, yeah, they also cater....and it's good too!
19	2	4	4	1	Oh my poor tummy.. why oh why did I do this to myself?! The name of this place should have been called PooPoo's!! All 3 of us were pretty sick the morning after.. it wasn't pretty let me assure you!  ...  ... The service here is great! Very friendly and fast.. the food well.. was hit and miss. The rolled quesadilla was pretty tasty.. a huge flour tortillas rolled with steak, peppers and cheese.. oh delish! Was thinking I would actually come back for this one. Then my red chile burro came.. looked great, nice and big covered in enchilada sauce.. then I took a bite expecting spicy goodness.. was bland and was almost all sauce, next to no meat what-so-ever.. you know how much I love meat! Dave took a bite and whispered to me "it tastes like cat food".. he's so wring sometimes and I thought I was crude.. ...  ... Seemed everyone here was ordering fajita's.. if I ever go here again (very unlikely, bad tummy sickness and way far) I would try those.. the smell was fantastic!!
19	4	2	3	3	I was craving some mexican food last Saturday and remembered seeing the reviews on this place and wanted to check it out and I am very glad that I did. ...  ... This place was delicious and authentic and the absolute best part is that the have 99 cent margaritas on Saturday and Tuesday ALL DAY !!!!!  I was in heaven. This is just the house margarita...but hell...for that price you can not go wrong. ...  ... We had the mini platter that came with tacos, flautas, chimichangas, a big tamale, tostada, and rice and beans. It was all delicious ( wehad our with the machaca). We also ordered a bowl of the Albondigas soup and it was sooo yummy !! Chips and salsa were great too !! We had the fried ice cream for dessert...nothing spectacular...just fried ice cream...but good anyway. ...  ... The service here was friendly, fast, and very attentive. I will definetly bo back here and would recommend it to you all !!!
19	5	0	0	0	been going here forever and always go back, even got married there in the dining room with all the family i have going here with all along. one of those neighborhood treasures you grow up with and still go back to the 'hood for.
19	3	1	1	1	I thought this was a little secret that I was going to keep for myself, but since a few others have spilled it, I should add my review.  ...  ... Popo's is a west side institution. When i needed to get my auto-brakes done, i asked someone at work where to go. They told me about a repair shop and the directions to find the place were, "it's over by Popo's." It was that way about a lot of things.... They were always at the same intersection as Popo's.... or right next to Popo's.... or down the street from Popo's. When i asked what Popo's was, i would get open eyed stares.... in the community where i work, not knowing about Popo's is unthinkable.... so... off we went after work one day.  ...  ... To say that the place is unpretentious is an understatement. From the outside, the place looks downright seedy. The building looks as if it is half vacant... the far end of the row of shops houses a drive through liquor store... and you get the feeling that it is that way because the parking lot is unsafe. Don't be fooled. It may look like a page out of Urban Blight magazine, but the people i have met in that neighborhood are warm, and friendly, and you are perfectly safe. I say this because, now.... when i take friends there for lunch, the usual response as we turn in the parking lot is a very leery "Where are you taking meeeee!?!?!"  ...  ... All the looks of fear and suspicion disappear once we go in... and by the time they have had their first mouthful of fundido, they are hooked on Popo's forever.  ...  ... The margaritas are huge and happy hour prices are cheap... My favorite is the frozen raspberry, or just a normal unfrozen margarita. I think I'm the minority because most of the ones delivered to my table are usually strawberry. They have a good selection of beer as well.  ...  ... Of all the appetizers, I LOVE LOVE LOVE the Queso Fundido... the one with spinach is to die for. At this moment, I'm drooling at the thought, and considering going there tonight. Sometimes I'll go wild on chips and have the fundido for my meal.  ...  ... My favorite entree there is the seafood enchilada, despite it being made of krab vs. crab. There are many levels of dining and i consider this "fun dining" as opposed to "fine dining" so while i rarely excuse the use of fake seafood, i will make an exception here. Second to that, i like the spinach enchilada, the tacos, and almost any kind of fajita they have. I've never had their red tamales but the green ones are tasty. I've never gotten a burro but friends have... and they go back for more.  ...  ... I don't know if they have entertainment every night, but last Friday they had a Mariachi band wandering through the place. It was great for my group of friends because we were having a send off dinner for a friend who is moving to Florida.... and of course, we took the obligatory photo of her with the mariachi band when they got near our table.  ...  ... Popo's is great for groups. The place is fun and friendly. I've never had a bad experience there... and since it's Cinco de Mayo, i just might be there tonight.
19	3	0	1	1	Had another great meal at PoPo's on Saturday. I took off one star for 2 things. #1: almost all of our silverware was dirty..very dirty #2: The 99 cent margarita gave me a sour belly..too much sweet & sour
19	3	0	0	0	I'm an adventurous restaurant goer and savor the thrill of a new find, so when my Mom's friend (whose credibility was heightened by herself being Mexican) said you've got to try Popo's we drove the 20 miles with open minds and hungry stomachs.  We knew it wasn't going to look like the Taj Mahal from the outside so no disappointment there when it appeared inconspiculously on the west end of a tiny strip mall.  However, when we went inside it was truly a pleasant surprise.  We were instantly intercepted by two friendly hostesses who gave us friendly smiles and pleasant hellos.  Then we looked around and saw the place was really well designed.  Beautiful interior, flat-screen TV's all over the place (bonus), beautiful tile floors and just a generally well-kept appearance.  I bolted for the men's room before being seated (after all, it was a long drive) and for those of you who have eaten at a lot of Mexican restaurants know the restroom is not always highly anticipated.  It was immaculate, had a granite countertop and hands-free everything.  Another bonus.  We sat down to the usual greeting of chips and salsa and our table of three unanimously agreed the chips were delicious and thin and crispy and the salsa was fresh-tasting, flavorful and with just enough heat to let you know you're alive.  I ordered the seafood enchiladas and was decidedly disappointed.  It wasn't bad, it just lacked a certain richness that makes a dish like that really sing.  My Mom got a chile relleno and taco---my parents are both relleno fans---and again something was missing.  It seemed like the batter was not prominent enough and thus lacked full flavor.  The taco, however, was killer.  The machaca beef was delicious and the shell was appropriatley greasy, lending to a nice hardy bite.  My Dad ordered a beef tamale which came nicely stuffed (lots of places you can't find the filling) but it was dry and lacked any real flavor.  He also had a cheese enchilada which was decent.  I must comment that my Mom makes THE BEST Spanish rice you'll ever eat and so we're constantly surprised at how much of an afterthought rice is at Mexican restaurants.  Not so at Popo's.  While it's not as good as dear old Mom's, it was the best I've had out at a restaurant.  Why?  It had flavor!  I tasted garlic and crushed tomato that to me makes it so good.  The beans were also excellent and flavorful.  Service was friendly and attentive.  I don't think I'll drive out of my way to go back but I would certainly eat there again and try different dishes.
19	4	0	2	1	Popo's has been around forever and it certainly looks the part. The neighborhood ain't great and the strip mall it's located in looks awfully scary at certain times of night, but it's definitely worth the risk. ...  ... The best days to visit are definitely Tuesdays and Saturdays, when they serve $.99 margaritas. While not the greatest margaritas in the world, you can actually taste the tequila and for $.99, you don't have much to lose. Generally, I get a chicken chimichanga or red chili burrito, both of which are solid and filling choices. If I'm heading over on a Saturday, I'll get a bowl of their red menudo, which is by far the best red menudo I've ever had. The chili has a nice kick, but overall it's a more subtle flavor than is generally found in a bowl of red. Works great as a late-night accompaniment to a margarita. ...  ... The staff are all pretty friendly and in the decade I've been going here, there hasn't really been a whole lot of employee turnover. It can be kind of a chore to get a seat on certain days, due to the customer traffic, and the parking lot is a pain in the butt, but if you're a west-sider with an appetite for Mexican food, Popo's should be in your itinerary.
19	3	3	5	2	Dear Popo's, ...  ...    If I had a stomach made of steel and a titan digestive system I would just love you until you overflooded with love. ...  ... Unfortunately I do not, and every time I come back from a scrumtious meal from you I am full of heartburn and have a tummy ache all day long :( ...  ... Okay, away from my own selfish additives, here is the low down on Popo's Mexican Food: ...  ... Popo's is located in a small strip mall, so keep you're eyes peeled because it's easy to miss! It is a classic for west Phoenix residents and has created a permanent buzz. Right when you walk in the staff greets you and serves you like the pros they are. This establishment has stood it's ground and kept a huge amount of loyals for years upon years.  ...  ... The food is served in beyond generous portions. Mountains of guacamole, sour cream and meat are piled onto the dish. Beans are rice are given an extra flair with this way-better-than-average salsa and cheese. The meat is so flavorful and juicy it's sure to be remembered. ...  ... Overall, the food is really good! However, if you are not use to eating heavy portions and extra fried food, it can be a bit rough on you. I would give Popo's four stars but due to the stomach ache and heartburn I had the rest of the day afterwards, I had to deduct a star. ...  ... If you are into big and yummy meals and have no limitations on portions and fats, then this place will be you're wonderland ;)
19	5	0	1	0	I've been eating at this restaurant for over 25 years. They serve the BEST mexican food in town. HANDS DOWN! The atmosphere is great for families or a date night! ...  ... The parking situation can sometimes be "interesting" and the area isn't the BEST part of town... but well worth it!
19	5	0	1	0	As visitors to Phoenix this past weekend, our group decided we wanted some delicious Mexican cuisine. We found a review for this place online and drove about 20 minutes (to what seemed like BFE) and finally arrived with hungry bellies. We were greeted by all 5 of the ladies standing near the entrance who seated us quickly. Our waitress arrived at our table quickly for our drink orders and was quite helpful.  ...  ... My only complaint about the service is that my friend's father wanted to try their $4 Rita-tini (?) that was advertised on the wall that was made with 3 Amigos Tequila. When he asked for the $4 special, we were told it was strictly for happy hour. The sign itself said absolutely nothing about happy hour - and the only reason I mention this is because every other sign in the bar that offered a drink special -only for happy hour- designated that clearly on the sign. The waitress wasn't amused when he jokingly asked if she could make an exception.  ...  ... Our meals were simply delicious. The carne asada was easily the best carne asada I've ever had, and being from Southern California I would like to think we have quite the selection. I personally ordered a 2 Chicken Tacos plate, which included rice and beans. The chicken was cooked differently from any other place I have ever been to, it was incredibly juicy and surprisingly flavorful.  ...  ... I couldn't pin point exactly what the other people at my table had ordered, but we were all settling into food comas shortly after commencing our delightful lunch (which wasn't the best thing considering we all had a 5 hour drive to make back to California). ...  ... If I ever find myself in Phoenix again, or even somewhere remotely close by- I would definitely stop in for another meal.

19	4	0	3	0	A girl friend & I went to this place based on the rave reviews of a coworker. When we parked we thought about maybe reconsidering our decision because it didn't look quite that appealing.  ...  ... Thank goodness we stayed! As soon as we walked in the yummy smell hit us. The place is simple, nothing fancy, but the food is good (we shared a sampler, which filled us both to the brim), reasonably priced & the Cadillac Margaritas are STRONG. The waitress was very nice & didn't rush us when it was closing time,,,,, it took us a while to finish those Margaritas, lol. If you have more than 1 I have 2 words for you. Designated Driver :) ...  ... Great place to come for a casual dinner or lunch with coworkers or friends. Not a place to take a date if you're trying to impress them :)  ... It's in a strip mall with limited parking, on some days I've heard you have to be there early to get a parking space & a table. We went late on a Friday night & had no issue with either though.
19	4	0	0	0	Love Popo's! Used to come here all the time when I lived in Phoenix way back in the 80's.  Love just about everything---great machaca.  Now whenever I visit relatives in Phoenix, I always make them take me here as soon as I hit town!  Glad to see it's lasted all these years..
19	5	4	3	3	This one is easy...PoPo's is the real deal, straight up. ...  ... It's been a institution for 46 years; I first ate there back in 1980.  This is classic, Nana's style Sonoran food.  I noticed that there are some reviewers here that rave about it but only rate it at 3 stars...por que?   ...  ... Heed not any naysayers. You don't stay in business for half a century making bad Mexican food in a town saturated with Mexican restaurants.  ...  ... It requires no further explanation; no "this was good but that was bland." "It's a shady part of town." "Parking is wack!".  It's a given that it's in Maryvale, the lot is small and in 46 years some individual dishes here and there are bound to be misses.  Just go there, order what looks good and you'll see for yourself why this place keeps packing them in year after year.
19	1	0	2	0	I I tried Popo's Mexican in Glendale, AZ at the new location off of Bell Rd. I will never return again. Horrid service, and the food was sub-par. Fried beans were microwaved, chicken tasted like water, and no cheese with the Fajita? What is everyone raving about? What a terrible restaurant.
19	5	0	2	0	For those of you with a cast iron stomach, you'll do well. For the rest of us mortals, well, I suggest staying near the bathroom the next day.  ...  ... Sounds horrible, but it really isn't. The food is really, really good. The portions are ridiculous, and they are not afraid to toss half a pound of cheese on your plate. Of course, you'll pay for it the next day, but its worth it.  ...  ... The spinach enchiladas are great, although I have no idea what that Baja sauce is, since its buried under a mountain of cheese.
19	3	0	1	0	Nothing stood out for better or worse, such that I  would not seek it out nor would I reject going back ...  ... Big portions for a decent price, but again, kinda run of the mill.
19	4	0	1	0	Great service and delicious Mexican food.  Everything is served with lots of cheese...yummy! Love the sopapillas with honey too.
19	4	0	1	0	Always Consistent. If a restaurant can't nail down consistency...what's the point? Knowing what you're getting when you go is a plus.  ...  ... This place has been here for a long time. There used to be a Popo's Too on the east side until it sadly closed down. My sister and I were not happy campers. But low and behold the original is still alive and well and kickin' great dishes EXACTLY LIKE THEY DID ON THE EAST SIDE! Again, consistency. The owner is always present and taking checks, seating guests and that again is an added bonus. Everything is fresh, the rice is great, unlike most places here where it's just starchy and gross and the medium salsa is always yummy. Request the hot salsa as well...it's not overly hot and quite frankly not sure why it's their "hot" salsa but regardless-it's deliscious. I had the El Pollo Especial except I ordered it not fried and with Machaca beef...and they were of course accomodating. The jalepeno cream cheese they top it with is well, excessive, however a little goes along way and I'll be eating the other half for dinner.  ...  ... If you get the opportunity to go, go. The margaritas are also quite yummy and who can go wrong with $.99 ritas for happy hour. Just wish they were closer to Scottsdale!
19	3	0	1	1	I hate to say it, but my recent 5 star review is coming down.  Why?  Well,  something bad is going on at Popo's.  On our last two visits we were underwhelmed with the service and the very last time we went (only 3 days ago) the food was sub-par as well.  We know they are in the process of opening a second location and hope that this sudden decline in awesomeness is due to that situation.  Don't know, but until things improve, I'm gonna not drive out of my way to visit.  Such a pity, as this place had amazing Sonoran style Mexican food.  My favorite thing on the menu was their incredible authentic rice which was undercooked and just plain not good on Friday night.  My next favorite thing is their salsa which tasted fine but was not properly prepared (huge chunks of uncleaned peppers and big pieces of cilantro) so it was off putting.   ...  ... Oh, please, will the Mexican Food Gods of Phoenix not let Popo's suffer the same failures as so many of their sister/brother mexican/american restaurants have suffered?  Seems like once they expand, the thing that made them so fantastic in the first place is lost forever. ...  ... I'm gonna go sit in the corner and cry awhile.
19	5	0	0	0	The best mexican food in the whole state, possibly the world. I crave it and have been going there since I was born! I love their salsa and the service is always great! ...  ... (except on the bell location, bunch of teenagers with zero service skills, they need to send the girls over there to teach them)  ...  ... They do deliver for orders over $100.00... Which is great when I order party trays for them.  ...  ... Bottom line, I would live there if I could :)
19	4	3	5	5	When someone mentions Mexican for lunch, I just figure it's gonna be another 'berto's, but not this time! ... Popo's is NOT easy to find and I almost drove right by it. It's in a little strip mall on the north side of Indian School. I didn't realize there was parking in back, but there are a few in front and I was lucky enough to find one.  ... We got a HUGE booth! The whole place is pretty spacious and the seating is super comfy. I always ask for a booth. I don't know why, but I love a booth. ... I had a combo of a chili relleno, enchilada and rice and beans. Everything was fresh, if a little greasy. There was a puddle of grease under my rice, but I didn't care much because I was eating Mexican food. We got chips and salsa right as we were seated. Service was quick during out entire meal. We ended up staying after our server left (it was one of those lunch meetings with 4 people who like to talk a LOT and we had to get our tab and pay so our server could leave) and nobody gave us any hassle for staying a couple hours. ... I really liked the bathrooms! Super clean, without that damn southwest decor. I reallllllllly hate kokopellis and cacti and whatever else makes up the southwest theme. Hate. Blech! ... The prices were a couple dollars higher than what you'd normally see, but it was fine since the quality of food was really good.  ... Oh, and I was speaking Spanish to the hostess but apparently she didn't speak it. Whoopsie!
19	1	0	0	0	I would not go back here. I ordered the all you can eat tacos. I asked for extra tomatoes, and when I received the tacos there were barely any tomatoes (although I did ask for extra!) and I was told I would be charged a dollar for asking for extra. I was not informed about this extra charge when I asked for them.  ...  ... The meat in the tacos was room temperature. The plate was hot, but the tacos were not.  ...  ... I've been to many Mexican restaurants in the valley, and I would honestly have to say the $1 tacos on tuesdays at Filibertos are better. I will not return here.
19	4	0	1	0	Good food, fast service, a lot of food, we had to get to go containers (not normal for us)
19	5	1	0	0	Way better then the new location! Have been going here for 12 years!
19	5	1	0	0	I LOVE this place, the freshly made salsa is always amazing, the food is great and I you get a lot of food for your money. I used to live only 15 minutes away and loved going, now I moved all the way to Gilbert, and I still try and make the drive once in a while to get my fix on Popo's. I recommend this place to friends and family.
19	5	1	2	0	How have I not reviewed this place? ...  ... I am pretty ashamed of myself for that and its a disservice to you my readers. I apologize!!! ...  ... This place is in the Maryvale area of Phoenix. They have fantastic daily specials, especially on Tuesday and Saturday. Why you ask? Good Question! 1.00 Margaritas with purchase on an entree limit 4 per person. Frozen or on the rocks and they are tiny. (Granted they are not the 1/2 gallon bucket glasses but 2 of them and I am happy, 4 of them and I am time traveling!) ...  ... Now for the food. Best. Mexican. Food. In. Arizona. ...  ... I do not say that lightly, growing up in Arizona I lived in Tucson for my childhood only to move up here to where it is hotter in my early 20s. I have had my fair share of Mexican restaurants here in town, and we have ALL been to a (Fill-in-blank)bertos. ...  ... I could drink the salsa by the gallon here. The tamales are amazing, the seafood enchiladas are wonderful, and the fajitas are to die for! ...  ... They have a ton of TV's to watch sports with too.  ...  ... The Bell Rd. Location is really good as well, but there is just something about this location that has be driving back down here even though the other one is closer.  ...  ... I highly recommend going, and you may drive right by it if you aren't careful. Its tucked away next to a pawn shop in a strip mall on the North side of the road. (More parking in back). ...  ... Go. Its worth it!
19	1	0	0	1	After having others recommend this place to me as the best Mexican in Phoenix, even going so far to say "I drive such and such amount of miles just to get there!" I was sorely disappointed when I tried the restaurant's fare. ...  ... I had a shredded beef burrito with a side of beans and my wife had some sort of chicken quesadilla, but you wouldn't know any of the dishes from a saucer full of salt. Yeah, the saltiness was that bad. On top of that, my wife's food was so greasy she didn't eat more than a few bites till she lost her appetite and returned it. ...  ... The service was good; the waitress was nice and didn't give us any flak about the return, taking it off the bill. Other than her, though, this place loses; "best place for Mexican," indeed.  ...  ... I've basically given up on finding decent Mexican in Phoenix; can cook better, myself.
19	5	0	0	0	I love this place. I has the best salsa and chips. It is a little scary when you have to park out back, but it is safe.
19	5	1	3	1	Update to my last review. The bell location is up to par!  ...  ...  ... Best food, amazing salsa ( i could eat a gallon of it), good prices, and awesome staff at both locations.  ...  ... I have been going to popo's for 23 years and love it just as i did the first time I had it.
19	1	1	0	0	Food is so so, they serve their food messy!!!  They put cheese all over the food by the time it gets to your table is a blob of melted cheese!!!!!!
19	3	1	2	1	Not sure why this place is such a fav for so many people. I thought it was "ok" but nothing that I would drive to. The $99 margs were great value and tasty but warning that they are VERY sweet and cant be altered to make less sweet.  Food was gringo mex food typical of AZ restaurants. I had the fajita salad and would definitely not order again not because it wasnt good but because it was completely average and didnt have many faj veggies .   Chips and Salsa were also typical avg mexican- nothing special or flavorful.   The one plus was our server who was very sweet. She was slow since it was busy for $99 margs but she was extremely cheerful and as attentive as she could be for as busy as she was.
19	5	1	2	1	Best margaritas I have EVER had and I have had plenty.  I love that no matter how busy they get, the ladies are fast with my order. I love coming here on Tuesdays or Saturdays for their .99 margarita special. My favorite meal is the chimi with jalapeo cream cheese. To die for! I love this little restaurant! Best Mexican food place for me.
19	1	0	1	0	Be very careful with this place. I ate there a couple months ago as an invited guest of the proprietor Michael. The food was OK, but not better than OK. I wanted flan for desert, but they were out. I decided to have no desert but Michael insisted that I try the chocolate burritos. Why anybody would eat something like this is beyond me. It's just stupid and nasty.  ...  ... An hour after the meal I was in a Fry's grocery store. I barely made it to the restroom before a serious bout of projectile vomiting ensued. If you like food poisoning with your tired Sonoran dinner, this is the place for you.
20	4	2	7	5	This very cozy cute cafe is a little hard to find, even though it's right off 1-10 and 40th st.  If you are a fan of independent unique restaurants, you should like this place. ...  ... The food is good, the atmosphere is even better.  All wood, very cozy and quaint.  I usually get the chicken sandwich which comes with avocado and bacon, and their fries are fresh cut.  It is comfort food at its best.   ...  ... I have heard their breakfast is great, but i believe they are open only M-F 6:00 am - 2pm (closed weekends).   If this is close to you for lunch/breakfast during the week, you shoudn't be disappointed .
20	3	1	1	1	A friend introduced me to this place for lunch. the other day and I'm so glad he did. It's off the beaten path but that doesn't seem to have hurt their traffic. They offer breakfast and lunch and have a pretty loyal crowd, but they're happy to see new faces too. ...  ... I had the tuna melt on Parmesan bread yum. The tuna is mixed with diced celery and sweet pickles, and it comes with bacon and Swiss (I 86ed the tomatoes ... big surprise). The french fries were fantastic! My friend went with the Thursday lunch special, which was beef burgundy tips over egg noodles (aka stroganoff), and didn't say a word from the time he leaned until his plate until it was all but licked clean.  ...  ... Drinks are self serve and I like that they brew their own ice tea - it's the good dark, teeth-staining ice tea that I loooooove. ...  ... To call this place a "greasy spoon" wouldn't do it justice. And, it definitely deserves a return visit.
20	5	1	2	1	I've been going to the Peppersauce frequently for about a year now and it is always good food.  They have a daily special which is always good.  They generally have pretty decent seating that can handle a group of 6-8 and its easy to get 4 in. ... The food is maybe best described as trucker food.  The got lots of different hamburger and chicken sandwiches as well as meatloaf, Reuben sandwich and other tasty lunch fair.  The portions are generally huge and just in case you are still hungry, they have some cookies you can buy on the way out.   Like the name of the restaurant implies they have a decent variety of peppersauces on the tables, such as Habenero Tabasco and Cholula. ... With a meal, a drink and tip you will get out for about $13-14 per person. (Although I am sure you could go cheaper, you really wouldn't get the experience.) ... They are also great for breakfast.  I generally split their breakfast burrito with a friend because its so large. ... My 5 star rating represents a "best in class" rating.  Sure there are other places I'd rather go given unlimited time and funds but for a good comfort food meal, this is as good as it gets.
20	3	0	1	1	A decent lunch spot with restaurant service in a fairly industrial area.  I would give the wait staff and atmosphere 4+ stars as it is a very comfortable little restaurant to have lunch at, whether it is with co-workers, business associates, friends or by yourself.  However, for the food I'm giving if 3 stars - nothing wrong with the food, but nothing great with it either.  Decent diner food, not many options to eat too healthy too (you need to be creative if you're watching calories!).  I eat there a few times a month typically, so I definitely recommend.
20	5	0	1	1	Very good food. Stopped for breakfast on a rainy morning on a friends reccomendation. Great food and very friendly service. I would recommend to anyone and can't wait till I am in the area again. Best hash in town.
20	4	0	1	0	Good food. Place seems a little hidden, but I like places like that. :) ...  ... They put green grapes in their side salad! Omg, it was soooo good! I really like their meatloaf too. Nice cafe to go to during my lunch break.
20	4	15	15	15	Where The Hell Are We!! ...  ... Like I said we didnt get to too many different places to eat this week. So everyday we would head over here for lunch and yes I mean EVERYDAY!Now they where driving and BUYING so what could I say, but wow this place was out in the middle of nowhere. It was an old converted house and they offered a huge menu of all country cookin. ... The place was always packed at lunch time so it was well known in these parts. I found the food very tasty and the service was great and entertaining. Wish it was here in these parts =)
20	4	0	0	0	ok  it is a ok (3stars) but just because the staff is fantastic and the food is very good and my waitress was a cutie I will step up to the plate(no pun intended) and give this hidden gem 4 stars. hidden in an  industrial area in phx this establishment is clean and the outdoor area is well maintained.
20	4	0	2	1	I have now been to this restaurant 5 times. I have taken my staff, my wife, a client, a vendor and just stopped for breakfast one day.  Always good, always friendly! It is also always very busy so go early; it is worth the hunt to find it.
20	3	0	0	0	i took the wife here this morning her first visit my 2nd visit i pretty much stick to my 1st review the service is fantastic and the food is good the sausage i had today was a pre maid patty and had a funky taste to it  my wife was not thrilled w/the breakfast burritto. though the place is cute and intresting decor i think my days at peppersauce are over it was good while it lasted ........its not you peppersauce its me
20	4	0	0	0	Small place, very hidden. Food was great. Service was friendly. It's pretty popular, every time I've gone, it was packed.
20	4	1	1	1	It may be tough to find, and the lunch service may take just a stitch over an hour, but Peppersauce is the best homestyle greasy spoon south of the airport. ...  ... Nestled in an industrial neighborhood, Peppersauce is the perfect blend of kitsch and delish that a old school cafe should be. The service style is a bit different--you generally don't wait to be seated, but can grab a table and your own drinks before being waited on. Service is spotty and definitely diner-esque, but the girls are very friendly. ...  ... There is really only one item on the menu that i order...the veggie reuben. It is a delicious mountain of sauerkraut topped with cheese and dressing on perfectly-grilled, buttery rye. It definitely ranks in the top ten sandwiches of all time for me. The fries, are ok, and the side salad is pretty good too. ...  ... If you are willing to navigate the industrial park to find it, you should give peppersauce a try.
20	4	0	1	0	I love Peppersauce!! It is a cozy little nook right by my office where I can get a hearty breakfast for really inexpensive. They have a little store front set up in the front of the restaurant where you can buy unique gifts. The food, service and ambiance is great at Peppersauce and I will defiantly be back!
20	5	0	2	0	Peppersauce Cafe is one of my favorite places to eat. Though there are many amazing dishes here, my favorite is the pulled pork sandwich. It is topped with onion rings and is FANTASTIC!. I discovered this restaurant about 3 years ago when I was working in the area. I have taken many customers and friends there for lunch. It's a real home cooked meal for just over the price of what you would get fast food. The staff is courteous and remembers who you are. I think that's important for businesses.  Anyhow, Peppersauce gets two thumbs up from me!
20	3	0	0	0	It was just okay. ...  ... I didn't have a hard time finding it.  The house/building isn't as cute as say Cibo or House of Tricks. ...  ... My husband and I shared a breakfast burrito with green chilies, tomatoes and peppers added to it.  It was edible but I have had better.  He had a side of fresh corn beef hash.  He didn't seem thrilled with it. ...  ... The service was great.  I wouldn't go out of my way to go back though.  That makes me sad because it is a breakfast/lunch place near my home so I really wanted to love it.
20	5	0	0	0	This cafe is sort of hidden away and only open until 2pm but it's great. Real friendly staff, and delicious food. I recommend the Peppersauce burger.
20	1	0	1	0	I went there with my friend who really likes it.  I ordered  an $8.50 Reuben that had three wafer-thin slices of corned beef wadded into a ball in the middle to provide the illusion that there was some beef on the sandwich.  I pointed this out to my not-so-friendly server when she queried my satisfaction with the meal.  She said, in a snotty put-upon voice, "Well, we weight the meat for every sandwich!  Every sandwich gets four ounces!"  It was clear this one was way under and when I pointed this out she said, "do you want more meat?"  I asked if I was going to be charged - she said "Yes!"  I said no thanks and now my mission is to dissuade anyone who cares from ever going to this place.
20	5	0	0	0	Great food the tuesday special is one of my favorites chicken fried chicken
20	3	0	1	0	Went for lunch. It was pretty busy so service is slightly slow, took a little over an hour for lunch.  ... The food is a little overpriced for what it is, but the quality is good. I got the grilled tuna steak salad. The tuna steak itself was a little over done and dry, and the salad was mostly iceberg lettuce, but it was passable. A little heavy on the cheese, but there were grapes in the salad and that was a nice touch.  ... My friend got the Thursday special, beef tips over noodles. He goes Thursday almost every week so, needless to say, he's a huge fan.  ... I would note, if you want a quick lunch pick somewhere else for sure.
20	5	0	1	0	We come out to phx for spring training games and we would eat breakfast here every day if we could. Have not tried lunch yet. The service is great also. Cassie is our favorite. She is the best person we have ever met. And if you need a police officer seems to always be some in there. Don't pass on this place.
20	5	1	4	0	The Peppersauce is reopened with new owners.  My wife and I stopped for lunch there today.  The inside has been painted and some things are moved around but basically it looks the same.  Only cleaner!  Not that is was dirty before but it was worn and needed fresh paint and spiffed up.   ...  ... I had the Bbq beef sandwich with coleslaw.  My wife had Fried Chicken with mashed potatoes and gravy.  The flavor was really good on both meals.  The service was excellent.   ...  ... We will be returning for sure!   Give it a try, you wont regret it..........
20	4	0	0	0	Peppersauce has reopened under new owners.  My wife and I stopped by for lunch yesterday (Thurs) with four other friends.  Were greeted by the owner.  Service was excellent.  Atmosphere is relaxed and homey.  Everything spotless and clean.  This place, locaded in an industrial area is so nice and home like.  Quiet and peaceful.  Leave the hustling world behind. ... Restaurant has breakfast and lunch--open 6:00 to 2:00. ... Wife and several of us had the special which was tri tips in burgundy sauce on a bed of noodles.  Simply delish.. ... One of my friends who loves hamburgers, in fact that's all he eats out is hamburgers, got the peppersauce burger which he declared excellent.   ... My wife got a ruben which she said was very good.  It came with slaw which she said tasted "old". ... Tea is brewed from real tea and was delicious.   ... Was a really good meal for us all.
20	4	0	1	0	Good food.  Good service.  Tiny parking lot.  Try the Texican!  Ground beef and chorizo.  Yum.
20	3	0	1	0	This is a decent place to grab lunch.  It's a converted house in an industrial area with not too many other options from what I could tell.  Not a ton of parking.  Plenty of tables and seating inside, much bigger than I expected.  It is VERY loud in there, definitely not the place for intimate conversation.   ... The service is friendly and fast, my butt had barely hit the chair when they were trying to take my order.  Really quick with the drink refills and bringing the food out. ... The food was average.  I got the meatloaf sandwich, a huge slab on meatloaf, provolone, on texas toast (is it wrong to call it texas toast in Arizona? ;) )  I thought the sandwich was plenty big, but a bit bland...lots of hot sauce came into play.  The potato salad was good. ... I would come here for a quick, gutbomb lunch.  I would also bring clients here for a quick, fun, downhome meal. ... ***Update - This has become my go-to-spot for a quick lunch and I will say that the Pablano Turkey Sandwich is my favorite menu item.
20	3	0	0	0	Food was adequate.  Staff were nice.

20	2	0	0	0	My wife and I eat here frequently and the quality has gone down lately.  I had the Meatloaf and it was not so good.  That visit was a couple of weeks ago.  This last week we stopped for lunch and I ordered a burger.  The patty tasted like the frozen ones you buy at Safeway.  Really??  Come on guys, put some effort into it.  It was tough and tasted like it had been frozen.    ...  ... Peppersauce could be a great place but it seems like they are cutting corners......

20	4	0	0	0	Really good, right down the street from my shop I eat there all the time.  Kathy is great, she cares and the food is good.  My fav is the chicken cob with balsamic.  If you're feeling like a burger or sandwich make sure to get the pretzel bun (yum).
20	4	0	1	1	Arrived just about the time this place filled up and that was around 11:40am. So much for the beating the crowd idea. Waitress said it wasn't usually this crowded. Still, about 20 minutes later, I had my Turkey Poblano melt and homemade potato salad. The salad had chopped radishes and green peppers which was unusual and the salad was served nice and cold with chunky potatoes. Everything in and around that melt was also quite good. The turkey quality could have been slightly higher, otherwise it pretty perfect. The parmesan bread was the highlight and the layers of mild poblano, pepperjack and bacon went together well. Let it cool and it is even better. Overall nice experience in this building that used to be a house and is in an unusual location in this area. Chicken salad looked great also on the way out.
20	4	0	0	0	Havent been here since about 2003 ish.... So i was surprised to see it still open in the same name,, Came in early this week and will be coming back. ...  ... Still familiar looking menu, and the daily breakfast seemed the same so i went with it... Will be back at least once a week,, So glad this place is still here now that i am working in the area again !!  ...  ... Keep up the great work.. ...  ... Place is Clean, portions are adequate to price, food tastes are above Par.. mmmmm
20	4	0	1	1	Stopped by for lunch,,, 1st lunch at this place and i have to say ,, The Teriyaki Shroomer was delicious !!!  ...  ... A tad greasy at the begining, but awesome flavor,,, def a goto lunch spot ,,,,  ...  ... Thanks again to the staff there,, !!! great job..
20	5	0	0	0	First time impression was awesome! Sat down as soon as I walked in, the server came right over and asked me what I'd like to drink and if I know what i want already! They must have a lot of regulars that come her for a quick good meal and go. Great business. I ordered the special, whatever it was it was fantastic. Fries were yummy and crunchy. Everything is great here, I look forward to being a regular. It's super close to my company's office!
20	4	6	10	9	Our team chose this place to have breakfast 2nd year in a row before our team build activity. I guess we spend so much time together we're starting to think alike because all 6 of us ordered the same thing, the chicken fried steak, gravy & eggs! Six people can't be wrong, we all cleaned our plates! I thought it was better than my usual favorite go to restaurant for chicken fried steak breakfast. This place appears to be a little hole in the wall Cafe but it was certainly busy, has great food and service to match,  one of those tucked away places that is a must try!
20	5	0	1	0	I used to go to this restaurant quite often, years ago. Didn't realize that they were open again until I read a fellow yelpers review about attending recently. My team at work wanted to do breakfast together, so I hastily suggested that we go to this cozy spot.  ...  ... I called ahead to inform them that a semi large group was coming. They said they would get a table ready and let the kitchen know. As I entered my first thought was that the place looks so nice inside! They have cozy little tables that look refinished from what I remember. I suggested the chicken fried steak and eggs to everyone because it is apparently to die for (and it was!). Many members of my team ordered it and those that didn't looked longingly at it as it passed under their noses.  ...  ... Our waitress was very friendly and gave suggestions as needed. She didn't seem to blink an eye that it was such a large table. The food came out quickly and was very yummy! She broke up the check for us, no questions asked.  ...  ... I am so excited that this restaurant is open again! I will definitely be going back as it is right near work (although that could be a bad thing!)
20	2	0	0	0	I have been here several times because it is a favorite go to place at my company due to its proximity. ...  ... They are open for breakfast and lunch only. The lunch food for me has been consistently terrible.  ...  ... I cannot recommend it for lunch.
20	5	0	0	0	Keep hearing great stuff about this place.  So, today I am going.   I will see if I have to change by review after I eat there, ...  ... Made it there and it was worth it.  Great fish and chips and peppersauce burger for the son.  We will be back.
20	4	0	1	2	WHOO HOO . . . My 100th Review ...  ... This place was definitely a great choice for a 100th review . . . I would have hated it if it was a bad review . . . but . . . this place rocked. ...  ... We were seated quickly and our waitress took our drink order . . . told us of their lunch specials and returned promptly to take our order.  For me . . . Iced Tea, Pastrami Melt with French Fries and a side of Coleslaw. ...  ... Iced Tea was fresh and clear and ice cold . . . Coleslaw was crunchy with just the right amount of dressing, not limp and watery . . . French Fries were hot, crisp and firm . . . and the Pastrami Melt was down right heavenly. ...  ... My only reason for not giving five stars was the noise level . . . there were times that I could not hear my lunch partner speak . . . I may be a little hard of hearing, but I am not that bad . . . This place is definitely on the I'LL BE BACK list . . .
20	1	0	0	0	Walked in at 3 minutes past 2 and was told they were closed. I said it was 2 and they told me "Too Bad" I said I just wanted something to go and I was told the kitchen was already shut down. Is this how they treat customers? I will tell everyone not to ever go there.
20	3	0	1	0	Cheerful place and friendly staff!  Good breakfast spot.  We had chorizo burro and huevos rancheros; they were solid presentations.  Not really fair as we've been eating killer Mexican in  Ensenada, Mexico recently.  Hope to come back for lunch soon!
20	5	0	0	0	I guess the new owners of been here about a year. I checked the other reviews and see some were under the old ownership. ... Was really surprised to see how good this burger I had was - just ordered the daily special - they make their own burger patties and this 1 was the jalapeno bacon cream cheese. It was awesome.
20	5	0	0	0	Good food great service at a reasonable price.  Good place to take customers for lunch.  Definitely will be going back.
20	5	0	0	0	Have eaten here numerous times. Really like the staff. They work as a team like I have you rarely see. The food is fantastic. Good comfort food is what I go here for. I had the chorizo burger last time I was there, out of this world.
20	4	0	0	0	Great Sandwiches, Salads, and Fries! Very friendly staff. A bit small during lunch hour rush but worth it!
20	4	0	0	0	Very friendly staff. Simple menu with enough options to satisfy anyone with either a sweet or savory breakfast craving. The food was hot and good. I got the chicken fried steak, which wasn't my favorite (I'm kinda picky on how I like mine) however was sill.good. the eggs were cooked perfectly which I appreciate a ton because I hate snotty whites and these over mediums were snot free. Good seasoning on my hashbrowns. Hot coffee. Great little breakfast nook that is easy to.get to, has great atmosphere, good service, and quality food
20	5	1	1	1	After nearly passing Peppersauce because of it's unique location, I finally located the trendy little hot spot. Trendy by a long shot, but what a hole in the wall it is! The ambiance is like your Grandmother's house during Christmas, depending on your family it might not apply to you, but it is welcoming, loud, and everyone is smiling. I love Yelp for this very reason, it links you up with the best place in town. Back in the day, I wouldn't have been able to locate this place because it is behind the freeway in an Industrial Park but today, I drove right up, walked right in, ordered my sandwich and enjoyed every last bite.  ...  ... The staff is friendly, I felt like a million bucks walking out of that place. My shoes were complimented, the women introduced themselves by name, and asked where I worked and sent me on my way with take-out menus. I was hesitant to get take out because what if I didn't like it, or what if they didn't pack the ketchup I requested, so right as I walked out I peaked in the bag... they didn't forget a thing not even down to the extra seasoning on the fries.  ...  ... Sitting back down at my desk to eat this glorious sandwich has enticed me enough to write this review because it was so close to perfect. I will be going back. I can't wait to go back, is it tomorrow's lunch yet?
21	5	0	3	2	Last Saturday my friend and I said, what else is there to do on a Saturday afternoon except eat, drink and hang out.  We definitely went to the right place to do this.  The new NoRTH in Arcadia, Sam Fox's latest creation, met our every need.  I started off with a Stray Dog to drink.  I'm not sure what was in it but it looked pretty and tasted good so I guess that's all that matters.  My friend tasted it and ordered that as her second drink since it was so good.   For an appetizer, we ordered the bread & cheese.  I had no idea what to expect because it said it came with tomato jam.  What is tomato jam?  I'm still not sure I know, but I know I would go back to specifically order this.  The garlic bread came with warm, melted Italian cheese, almost like fondue, in a little skillet.  The bread with the cheese and the tomato jam was the perfect bite...Mmmm.   Next we ordered a pizza to split.  Verdure was the name of it.  It was topped with brussels sprouts, butternut squash, caramelized onions, hazelnuts and ricotta salata.  Need I say more?  Delish!  My friend and I even told the valet guy on our way out to make sure he tried the pizza with the butternut squash.  Next we split a pasta which was a recommendation from our waiter.  (Obviously...how could someone not recommend this).  This was definitely my favorite.  The Agnolotti (definitely homemade!)  was filled with ricotta, mascarpone, pecorino, grana padano and topped with herb butter.  The sauce was so light that it allowed you to eat every single bite, and we both did, without being too rich.  I don't usually eat pasta, but I will definitely be eating this again soon.  It really was so delectable.  Next we split the Scottish salmon salad.  How come I would never think to put marcona almonds and figs in my salmon salad with white balsamic?  It was so tasty and flavorful.  The food being served at tables near us definitely kept catching my eye.  Everything looked so unique and appetizing.  Besides the food, the atmosphere was also very fun and chill.  We were just enjoying our afternoon hanging out and eating amazing food.  Oh wait, I forgot my second drink.  I got the Red Rooster which was like a fancy version of a Bloody Mary.  It came with a little skewer of a caprese on it - really it came with little tomatoes and mozzarella on top of it.  So awesome!  We also ordered affogato for dessert but I was too full to eat it.  My friend said it was orgasmic.  Guess that explains that.  All of the waiters were very attentive.  Service is not always good at a new restaurant, although here it was exceptional.  It was fun to check out (no pun intended) all their different plaid and checked shirts too.  Boring uniforms at a Fox Restaurant...never.  I even told my friend and one of our waiters that this is the best Fox Restaurant yet.  I don't live as close to this restaurant as a lot of other Fox Restaurants, but I will definitely be back and cannot wait to try more yummy food.
21	4	5	9	8	Sam Fox does it again!   ...  ... I've been a somewhat regular patron of NoRTH Kierland and I'm also a fan of the NoRTH locations in Tucson and Denver, so I was really excited to find learn that the sixth location was being built just minutes from my house in Arcadia! ...  ... FRC did an amazing job transitioning this old car wash space into a gorgeous looking modern Italian Farmhouse.  It's spacious and and comfortable.  While I've only been for lunch, I will definitely return for dinner, and I hear they may be serving breakfast at this location too which I'd be down to try also. ...  ... While I'm not a fan of being forced to valet, at least it's free (although you've gotta factor in a tip). All of the staff from the valet to the hostess and waiters were exceptionally friendly, and as mentioned in other reviews, their "uniforms" are extremely cool.   ...  ... But even more important is the food... and this menu is different than the others (although they do have some of my favorite old standbys like zucca chips and the insalate casa aka Caesar salad).  Some new favorites from my recent lunch are the salumeria panini (soppressata, salami, mortadella, roasted peppers, provolone) and the verdure pizze (brussel sprouts, butternut squash, caramelized onion, spiced hazelnuts, ricotta salata).  And if you're looking for a little snack or starter, I'm a huge fan of the crispy chickpeas.   ...  ... Since this new location is conveniently located super close to my home, I can't wait to return to try some of their other menu items and some wine, beer, or cocktails from their very well stocked bar.  Happy hour, anyone?
21	5	3	2	1	New Sam Fox restaurant and I think we have struck gold, baby!!!  We went for breakfast this morning and had a wonderful meal, so we decided to check out their dinner menu.  It was very busy for a Sunday evening and the food was absolutely fabulous!!! We started out with the Italian Salad that had a beautiful lemon, oregano dressing.  After we ranted and raved over that,   I had the Ricotta Gnocchi which was beef short ribs in a horseradish creme and arugula.  It was HEAVENLY!!!! I wanted to swim in it, but that would be weird.  My husband had the pork chop with cabbage and a creamy polenta.  It was prepared to perfection!  And dessert?  Normally we say, "no".........but please....Italian donuts in a vanilla marscapone cream with lemon curd?  I wanted to cry. Deeelicious.  This is a FABULOUS new hot spot and we have made it our mission to eat our way through the menu!   The servers and staff ALL had smiles and were so kind.  This is my new fav and THANK YOU for being close to home!!!
21	5	0	0	0	So happy to have another option in our great restaurant rich neighborhood. The space is much larger than it appears from the street, and is broken up really well into comfortable areas. The open kitchen really does have an Italian country feel, and the lighting gives the very large open room a warm feel. Nice large bar as well. Best of all is the number of walls that open up to the outside-perfect for this time of year. Our server had the perfect combination of personality and humor-not too much, just right. The menu has a great selection, no matter your appetite. The Burratta was nice and creamy, with a nice compliment of apple slices and Rocket. The potatoes with parmesan, rosemary and perfect lemony aioli were off the chain. I wanted an order to take home! Pizza crust is very tasty and perfect texture. Hanger steak was perfectly cooked and seasoned. The brunch menu looks super yummy-we definitely have a new hangout on the hood. Great job, Sam Fox!
21	4	0	0	0	I like.  This restaurant is very inviting with a bright interior that looks like a fancy barn house.  There is a large outdoor seating area as well.  Fresh pasta is made in the open kitchen.  Upon the recommendation of the waiter, I ordered the ravioli filled with pork and mushroom in a light butter sauce.  The lemon zest is a refreshing addition.  For a starter, we also got the chef's board which includes 2 cheeses, 2 meats, and crusty bread.  Overall, the food is tasty.  The wine list is good.  -1 star because I do not like valet parking and the openness of the restaurant means flies are welcome to sample your food at the table...
21	4	0	0	0	I really enjoyed the new NORTH in Arcadia. The waitress Madison was very helpful and knowledgeable. The atmosphere was lively and fun! The only thing I had a problem with is that when you asked for bread, they said there was a charge for this.  I didn't think that should be the case....otherwise I would give it an A-.
21	5	1	2	1	Tried the new NoRTH this Sunday in Arcadia and we sat outside and loved the atmosphere!  The fondue bread appetizer was awesome and to die for! I could have eaten the whole thing myself! We shared the Italian Salad and the beet salad and both were delicious. We also shared the beef short rib gnocchi and the rock shrimp pasta and both were great. Save room for the Italian donuts in cheese cream sauce. Extremely decadent!  Great place! I would go back and sit at the bar if I were by myself. The bar is nice and opens inside to the outside just like Hawaii!
21	3	2	0	0	Genuinely, three stars for this place.  I've read some pretty exaggerated positive comments about this restaurant, I would have given it a lower score had it not just opened, always room for improvement (hopefully they'll make it with the food.) ...  ... Atmosphere is pretty cool and hip, the building is brand new and the look borders on industrial with a slight flare of giddy-up, certainly not conventional Italian which I really like.   ...  ... The food is not quite what I expected. I ordered a rice meatball in tomato sauce appetizer that was too salty.  For the entre, a pork plate that, again, was just okay.  It wasn't that flavorful and wasn't something that I would care to order again.  The same goes for the hamburger I ordered on a Sat. afternoon along with a bloody Mary. The bloody Mary they reinvented and contained bits of cheese!  My first sip through the straw launched a chunk down my throat and I nearly gagged!
21	5	1	1	0	My husband and I just had the best meal we've had in some time.   We started  by sharing the fall vegetable salad, singlehandedly the most innovative salad I've had in a long time-faro, kale, romaine, dates and almonds in a beautifully light (and properly) dressed  white balsamic dressing.  Lord have mercy, that was GOOD! We then shared the ricotta gnocchi with beef short rib, arugula and bread crumbs. The bread crumbs did not go unnoticed by me.  They added a "snap" to the gnocchi that was fabulous-beautiful texture!  We also shared the raviolini which was stuffed with pork and roasted mushrooms, topped with fresh arugula in a preserved lemon sauce. Again, innovative and unbelievably delicious.  So unexpected, so delicious and all recommended by our knowledgable waiter, Connor.   And because we each took a very long bike ride today (and because we are pigs), we treated ourselves to one dessert each! The sticky toffee cake and the affogato.  Both were very good but super sweet and I would not have them again together-a bit too much. But that was our mistake. We simply couldn't stop. Once I got used to the salt on the sticky toffee cake which was a bit shocking on the buds (trust me, I know all about the salty sweet thing-I was a fan of it before you were born), I grew to adore it. We also got the affogato which we both agreed was a bit too sweet. I would have liked to bite into something a bit more substantial than just nutella-and trust me, I dig nutella. To sum up our experience-GO!
21	4	3	12	4	I think I've found a new addition to my Arcadia list of likes! I remember NoRTH from my days of U of A. It was the first of its kind of Tucson and the place for college kids to go if they wanted to feel "grown up" and for the small group of young professionals who live in Tucson to hang out at night. Well, fast forward some years and Sam Fox has now opened up another NoRTH location in the Arcadia hood and I'm a huge fan!  ...  ... I've been here a couple times now and I've been happy with every visit. I absolutely loved the anti-pasta boards which come with your choice of cheese, meat and accompanied by sourdough bread. It's a perfect meal for lunch if you feel like sharing that and a salad. There paninis are buttery deliciousness! Be prepared that these guys are not low-cal, but if you're in the mood for some delicious buttery bread sandwiched with creamy cheese and yummy meat, this is for you. My favorite is the salumi which is a combination of meat and cheese. As for the pizzas, again this is no low-cal option but they are soft and crunchy at the same time and come in a variety of flavors.  ...  ... I love the decor of NoRTH. It feels like there should be an ocean or lake right outside the doors and I really enjoy the open environment of this converted car wash. The high ceilings and open doors make the restaurant open and airy. There's plenty of seating including bar seating along with dining seating. This would be a good spot to either go for some drinks and appetizers or a full meal.  ...  ... Thanks for bringing a tasty addition to the Arcadia neighborhood!
21	5	0	1	0	I just had the gnocchi with short ribs! My new favorite meal! So yummy:)
21	3	0	1	0	I went there Sunday for brunch by myself, sat at the bar. Was promtly greeted and given a menu, no smile however. I had a few questions about the coctails which were answered and I debated between two drinks I got the one I didn't order. However I didn't mind because it was fantastic.  ...  ... I had the fritata which was nice but small, I enjoyed the swiss chard and fingerling potatoe combo and the smoked mozz over the fritata was nice. I also got a side of polenta. Which was not your typical polenta, it was delicious don't get me wrong but it had no texture, it might as well been cream of wheat. It was very creamy and smooth and I was just expecting a more textured dish when it comes to polenta.  ...  ... I will say I did like the big open space and farm like appeal, however I did not like the dirt patio.  I would like to go back to try some other dishes, some of the pizza's looked more interesting than others and the salads I would like to try. ...  ... Over all I would give it 3.5 stars and would come back, at least for a drink if not to eat again.
21	4	0	0	1	Went there for lunch. The grilled chicken sanwich was great, the grilled vegtebles sandwich was not. Tasty but very oily... ... The place looks great and the service was fantastic. Sam Fox knows how to create them :)
21	5	0	1	1	I'm a big fan of small and local business and I must admit I felt a little protective when I saw a Fox Concepts restaurant going up in my own neighborhood.  I finally decided to try it with a friend and I have to say it's a wonderful addition to current Arcadia offerings. ...  ... I stopped by ahead of time to grab a menu to peruse and I was immediately excited because I saw that if my first visit was good, I'd have to do about 10 more to sample everything that caught my eye.  When I see "Italian" I brace myself for more of the same old pastas and sauces, but this menu has a lot of variety, and it includes seasonal offerings (which as a nutritionist is important to me). ...  ... I tried a farro-kale salad and would order it again (on trip 11, after trying everything else!) ...  ... My friend and I sat on the patio which, despite the cold night, was packed the entire time we were there. ...  ... I do love the neighboring restaurants but it's nice to have a little bit of competition for inspiration.  So happy this is within walking distance for me! ...  ... Valet parking is complimentary, by the way, for those who drive.
21	3	1	2	0	NoRTH solidified and provided affirmation to my opinion of Fox Restaurant Concepts as a whole.  This one is on par with the product they produce, and I will say that they do their thing well.  You know to expect a cool place; well decorated, creatively put together, very trendy, hip design and atmosphere.  Casual enough that you can go in and relax, but edgy enough that the yuppies and trendy socialites will like to be seen.  The food is good, but never memorable "I need to go bag and have that ___" good.  The ingredients are fresh and the meals are well prepared and creatively crafted, however, that's what you should get, for the price.   ...  ... NoRTH is no exception to any of these predispositions.  The staff is good looking in their plaid attire to convey the casual-ness, and we were promptly greeted (and thanked on the way out).  After about a 10 minute wait we were seated at one of the high top tables in the bar area, which gave a nice vantage point to see the neat array of material used in construction.  The place is well staffed, service was as it should be, and everything was completed in a timely manner.  So lets start with drinks, shall we? ...  ... The wine list is a bit confusing, because many of the varieties aren't common nomenclature.  Maybe I'm wine ignorant, but to me, it seems as if it would have been more helpful to give a description of each, or at least order them from lightest to fullest body...anything to give you a clue as to what was what.   Looking to appetizers next, more menu questions arise.  There are some items on the front page that should be ordered a la carte, I guess? to assemble an antipasti board of sorts, but then there are full blown apps on the inside of the first page.  A bit confusing as to what is what.  We simply wanted some bread to go with our Italian fare, and since it wasn't included, we ordered the baked olive oil bread from the front page.  It was good, but neither the two of us or our server were sure that we were going to receive what we were seeking.   ...  ... The dinner menu has some creative and fresh takes mixed with old standards, as you would expect from the fox brand.  A few more questions on what was what, and we had our decisions.  I embarked on the chicken wrapped in prosciutto, and my lady half took on the shrimp pasta dish.  Both came out in a reasonable amount of time, and were presented very well.  The food was good, nicely put together, and creative enough that you felt you weren't eating somewhere else.  The pasta dish she had was very unique, in a red sauce that was minty at first, spicy, then finishing in a basil-y sweetness.  The verdict is still out but it was a cool dish, and my girlfriend enjoyed it.  The prosciutto wrapped chicken was very nicely crafted on a bed of sauteed spinach with some fingerling potatoes that were delicious.  The chicken was prepared properly, although I thought I would have been maybe a little more moist considering it was wrapped in ham and so salty...I was expecting a brine effect of moisture.  Either way, both meals were good, but then again, it seems like they should be at $17 each.  Neither will leave me with the overwhelming urge to go back anytime soon, but I wasn't dissatisfied either.   ...  ... To make it a true date night we finished it off with the nutella cake and vanilla gelato thing.  It was very decadent, the nutella cake portion was flour-less so almost like a mouse, topped with the cold and creamy gelato and chocolate covered espresso beans.  There was a nice contrast between the flavors, textures, and even the temperatures of the warm cake and the cool gelato.  This would serve as the highlight in my opinion. ...  ... So all in all, NoRTH to me is like every other fox restaurant, it's cool, good, consistent, maybe a little overpriced for food that is slightly casual, but it's good enough that they get away with it, and you realize you are paying for the ambiance and experience too.  It's another one of those places I know I can get a good meal, but leaves you searching for more if you like those rare finds that provide you with culinary perfection at the same price, or the complete package for slightly more.   ...  ... 3-stars is completely appropriate.  It's good, good enough that we will probably end up there again, but not good enough that you can't wait for that time to come.  Nothing really blows you away in terms for food, service, quality, ambiance, or any other intrinsic for that matters, so I'm not sure it would deserve any more stars, it's a solid "good".
21	4	1	2	0	Tip - You have to utilize their "complimentary valet." There is no way around it, the restaurant is located in an area with NO street parking within walking distance and the plaza across the street is off limits to NoRTH patrons. ...  ... Now onto the review: ... NoRTH is yet another great Fox Concepts restaurant to take a date, with just the right amount of mood lighting. I happen to enjoy looking at my boyfriend ;) so I wouldn't care if the room was bright as day, but you know how some fancy restaurants are just SOO dark that the song "better with the lights off" comes to mind? This is definitely not that, I don't like those restaurants haha. ...  ... ANYWAY, the decor is cute, decked out with a modern farmhouse feel and the plaid-shirt suited up service is IMPECCABLE. The food is pretty good too :) ...  ... Here's what we ordered: ...  ... $11 - Cheese & Bread platter: Melted Italian cheese with tomato jam + toasted Sourdough bread with olive oil -- this was pretty good, especially with the tomato and fruit jam in the middle of the cheese to spread onto the perfectly toasted bread. **NOTE: THIS IS A LARGE & FILLING APPETIZER  ...  ... $17 - Rock Shrimp Pasta: VERY DELICIOUS! The noodles are playfully shaped and the sauce is a tomato base with a little citrus hint and some chili flakes. That's my personal description of it, but the menu description sounds way better - that's why I ordered it, and when I did, the waitress confirmed that it was her favorite pasta dish on the menu. ...  ... $15 - House Special Pizza - Fresh mozzarella, some type of Italian sausage (but it was very thinly cut, almost like prosciutto) and tomato sauce. This was okay in my book. Nonetheless, nice serving size and good taste - definitely enough for one person.
21	4	1	2	1	I LOVE this restaurant!! I have been here two times and the food is delicious!! The whole ambiance of this restaurant is unlike anything else I have seen.  The decor is spot on, even down to the servers uniforms.   ...  ... Ok and the food was AMAZING! I came with a large group so we sorta split everything!  We tried a few of the pizzas and salads and everything was delicious!! Plus they have a house bottle of wine for $20!! (GREAT DEAL) ...  ... The only downside is the parking, but where on 40th st doesn't have parking issues :)
21	4	0	0	0	Food and atmosphere were amazing, but service mildly sucked.  ... Went for lunch with some girlfriends I hadn't seen in ages so we wanted a place where we could hang out and enjoy some fine foods and laughs.  It was two vegetarians and 2 non vegers.  The server wasn't sure about which dishes were  vegetarian which made one of my friends a little unsure still whether her dish had chicken stock in it.  We ordered a couple drinks and food that we all shared.  I wasn't a huge fan of my Malbec in a water glass, but the wine itself was nice and inexpensive ($7)   ... We got the pizza that had brussels sprouts, onions, nuts, and sweet potato that was one of the most delicious pizzas I have ever had (and I have had A LOT of pizza). All the flavors blended perfectly while maintaining their own individual deliciousness.   We also got the pesto tortellini that was also pretty amazing.  It was cool to watch the kitchen crew making the pasta out in the open too.    ... There was another pasta with red sauce that was good and a chicken sandwich that was also  good, but not overly memorable.   ... The restaurant is nice open air, with a very relaxed atmosphere that doesn't make you feel you need to rush.   ... Comp valet was a nice touch to the meal.
21	4	0	0	0	Before going to NoRTH, I thought it would be just another chain formula "Fox-in-the-box" type restaurant. Wow, was I mistaken! As a big fan of independent, mom and pop businesses serving up local flavor restaurants, I don't say that very often. ...  ... New York Steak ... The NY steak was perfectly cooked medium rare and deliciously tender.  Not on par with anything from Donovan's or Ruth's Chris, but a solid choice for the money.  ...  ... Scallops ... As an avid scuba diver, I love seafood and eat scallops every time I'm near the ocean. These were some of the best I've ever tasted. ...  ... Tiramisu ... I enjoyed the tiramisu, especially the unique way it was served, but I don't feel that it was memorable.  Good, but not great. ...  ... Service ... Our service was attentive without being overbearing.  I appreciated the time our waiter took to review each section of the menu and provide not only suggestions, but commentary on the entrees.
21	5	0	1	0	Great service, food & atmosphere; love the new location!! ...  ... We started out with the bread & cheese... so good, I love how the bread was grilled, one of my favorite ways to eat bread & the cheese was nice & tasty.  ...  ... For an entree my friend & I split the Fungi pizza, which was amazingly savory, oh so good! My husband had the salami panni which I stole a bite from & it was freakin' good! There french fries are smashed potatoes cover in graded parmesan, they were good but a bit too heavy for me, I am a skinny fry type of gal. ...  ... All & all a great lunch & I will definitively be coming back, maybe when we have visitors in town since the ambiance is so great!
21	5	1	2	2	Decided to stop by and check out the new place Tuesday.  Complimentary valet is convenient if you get there early before the lot fills up. ...  ... I was impressed by the nice open design and high ceilings of the building.  I grabbed a seat at the bar and the server was super friendly and informative. ...  ... My pizza was on happy hour special that day and was only $8 which was a great value. I can't remember exactly what was on it other than chicken.  I also tried some of my friend's mafaldine pasta which was delicious with the rock shrimp. ...  ... This is a fun place bustling with energy.
21	2	0	0	0	despite my best attempts to divert a visiting aunt from dining at this place, we ended up at NoRTH for dinner one evening. ...  ... the service is great, the location and ambience are nice too, but the food is just terrible. the appetizers and main dishes were really not tasty at all. i truly feel that the restaurant tries too hard to serve trendy spins on regular dishes. they just end up tasting gross. ...  ... come for drinks (those are great), but skip out before eating.
21	5	0	0	0	Went to North with my family of 11, including the under 7 crowd. We had a good table near the kitchen, so the kids (and adults) could watch the pasta being made. Everything I tasted was really good, including: ... o Raviolini, pork with lemon preserves tastes so fresh. ... o Tortelinni ... o roast pork ... o beet salad, also,with a hint of lemon ... o short ribs w/ gnocchi  ... Save room for dessert! The budino, salted caramel and bombolini (essentially donuts) we're fabulous. ... The wait staff was very attentive and good. The ambience was modern and not pretentious, with a good mix of families and others. ... Definitely would go back.
21	4	0	0	1	I don't do a lot of reviews; compelled to write one for this restaurant. This place is fairly new; converted from a car wash station. Inside was contemporarily beautiful. The food is EXCELLENT and our server Brandon is hands down the most pleasant waiter we've ever had in a long time! He should get a raise soon because we believe he loves his job. The only thing that made me not want to rank this as a 5 star because you are forced to give your keys to the valet; no biggie. Check out this place for the ambiance and great Italian food!!
21	4	0	0	1	Sam Fox, you always seem to have a beeline directly to my  wannabe foodie heart. ...  ... I came to the New North as I call it just four days after it opened. Usually you think brand new restaurant they are probably still ironing out the kinks right? You must not know Sam Fox like I know him. This man has a knack for turning mediocrity into excellence. I mean the space used to be a car wash! A CAR WASH! Only Fox vision could turn a car wash into  an amazing addition to the Phoenix restaurant scene.  ...  ... The restaurant is officially called North Fattoria Italiana, which I will tell you was confusing at first. When your friend calls you and says "Want to go to North, it's the new Sam Fox restaurant?" "You mean the one at Kierland? That's not new." "No not that one a new one." HUH?? ...  ... I decided to stop asking questions and just go. Our waitress informed us that Mr. Fox is probably going to take all of his North locations in this more casual direction.  ...  ... I started my experience with the Julietta cocktail. Super awesome and girly, I love any cocktail with bubbles. Plus the cocktail looks like an accessory to your already cute outfit.  ...  ... The menu is a neighborhood Italian vibe. Pizza, pasta, antipasti. Of course, there is the Sam Fox flair. I shared the margherita pizza, which was very good and the ricotta gnocchi. Both were stellar. The gnocchi is not a traditional potato gnocchi, but it was very good.  ...  ... Of course I finished off my meal with dessert. Since, nutella to me is as good as gold I ordered the "affogato", and it was a great end to an overall great meal and experience.  ...  ... A plus was that our waitress was very knowledgeable and attentive. Always nice to have good service when you are spending your hard earned cash. I can't wait to go back and give New North another spin. ...  ... Touche Sam Fox, touche.
21	3	0	0	0	This is a struggle, because expectations were set high from recommendations and reviews.  I have to say the food was a little disappointing, or at least  inconsistent.  The Italian mixed greens salad was excellent.  The kids had the pepperoni pizza, which was very good.  I favor thin crust pizzas which this was.  I had the tagliatelle.  The pasta was thick, too dense for my taste and the sauce was forgettable.  My wife had the seabass.  The sauce and vegetables overwhelmed the delicate flavor of the fish.  I didn't like it at all.  That said the service was attentive and the atmosphere was casual upscale.  I would be willing to give the place another try.
21	4	0	0	0	Had a wonderful happy hour nosh and drinks.   Love the design and layout of the restaurant.  We sat out on the front patio and it was very charming. ...  ... The service was super friendly and attentive.  We got one of the chefs small pizzas...with mushrooms on it...was delicious.  And we got the cheese, meat and bread nosh plate which was delightful. ...  ... Have been many times to the NORTH ...up North.  The vibe at this one is much more casual and relaxed.   Have to try the main dishes for dinner next time.

Our food was fantastic, our service was great and the wine list was pretty good as well.   ...  ... Will surely go back.
21	3	0	0	0	Well, I have this soft spot for the FOX restaurant group because they totally nail it when it comes to atmosphere, decor, and a great staff. But I'm learning that while those are their strengths, it's the flavor of the food that's lacking. Don't get me wrong, the food is not bad by any means, it's ok or good, but it's not great. I can get GREAT pizza and pasta at some other places in the valley, and they may even be cheaper there. So while FOX gets an A+ in most categories, they need to bring their B to an A in flavor. But this is just my opinion so try it for yourself. It's worth going to and sitting at the outside bar is awesome. I will give it another shot there by ordering some other things on the menu. Would love to prove myself wrong.
21	2	0	0	0	I went there for lunch today.  The food seemed pricey.  I had the mushroom pizza for $14 which was OK, there were 2 pieces left and neither I or my guest took it home.  The Italian salad was very good but a bit pricey for $12.  We had coffee and it was so weak we could not drink it.  The service was good but I don't think I would go back.
21	5	0	0	0	I love this place. Delicious homemade pasta and a beautiful, open atmosphere. They accommodated my birthday party of about 30 people even though they don't take non-corporate reservations. They were still able to sit us all in the same general area relatively quickly on a busy night. I've gone a couple times since it just opened and I haven't been disappointed once. Sometimes I even stop by here for a drink on the patio while I walk my dog around the neighborhood. While I'm sad that it is no longer that really awesome hand carwash, I can't complain that it is a really awesome Fox Concepts restaurant right down the street from my place. Will definitely go back. Often.
21	1	1	0	0	The food was okay but the portion sizes where the smallest I have ever seen....and I am a regular to fox restaurants.   ...  ... Babbo is much better.
21	4	0	0	0	While the brunch menu is more lunch in my opinion, I was pleasantly surprised when I received my egg sandwich.  The size was twice as expected. Not your tiny muffin sandwich.  What made the entree was the crispy potatoes. They are simply out of this world.  Top ths meal off with fresh oj, great service and atmosphere.  My new brunch location. Good job sam
21	3	0	7	3	I agree with Ashley D.  This place is beautiful, the decor in amazing and the kitchen looks impeccable, however I didn't feel like I want to come back as a place I would like to hang out.  We went with another couple, who suggested the place.  The food is not bad, however it is not memorable.  As a native Italian, I know pasta and pizzas. I stated with the Heirloom Beets salad, that was delicious.  I think my favorite item of the night. For my entree, I had the Tortelloni, they were good, however I think they are overworking the pasta.  There were spots that were really tough at the seams of the pasta.  By the way, the portion for this dish is really small, which for me it ok since I am always watching what I eat.  The filling, made with mascarpone was great.  I was noticing while we were eating at one of the high top tables that one of the kitchen members was beating the heck out of the pasta.  I have to say, though I was coveting their pasta machine.  The wonders of automation, I have to crank my pasta maker.  I think I should get me one of those, before my mom's next visit.  My hubby had the House-made sausage pizza. Again, the dough was so overworked that the pizza was too chewy and not in a good way.  My friend had the Gigli, a pasta with pesto sauce, very nice.  Her husband had The Pig pizza.  He left all the crust since it was too chewy.  The dessert they push is the Salted Caramel Budino, it is good, but as a sweet tooth person, I didn't finish it and that is a lot to say.  Not much dimension or texture, just pudding like textures all the way.  On the other hand, my hubby's dessert, the Affogato was delicious.
21	2	0	0	0	Food is just average and a bit over priced.  Not up to the Fox standards I have come to expect.
21	5	0	0	0	get the butchers plate? I want to say thats what its called, I dont think its on the menu. but its a platter of all sorts of yummy things that they are serving that day like meats and cheeses and olives and spreads. ...  ... they also dont have sangria on their menu but they'll make it for you and its pretty tasty.  ...  ... most importantly though is order a side of olive oil with whatever you get (for pizza crust, bread, etc.) Its literally heaven-sent. I would bathe in it.
21	2	0	0	0	Decent cocktail and wine menu but like most of the stiffs in this place, they are trying a little too hard.  Just the fact that some idiot took a picture of an exotic sports car in the parking lot says it all (pic #11). ...  ... They try to have the neighborhood vibe and to be inviting but none of my neighbors want to pay $18 for a plate of average pasta.   ...  ... Don't wear a plaid shirt with jeans or else people will look at you like you're part of the waitstaff.
21	5	1	0	0	Long wait for table....... Turned to short. I like this place more !
21	4	0	0	0	For those of you Napa fans... It's Press with an Italian twist. What an amazing, open, social atmosphere. Ample bar seating for mingling of the singles scene. Amazing drink menu - my favorite is the "julietta".  Definitely worth trying out. ...  ... I've been a big fan of the North in Scottsdale for years, and really like that they've mixed things up at this new location. Plenty of great appetizers, salads and pizzas... but my favorite - the house made pastas.  In particular, the short rib gnocchi - it's to die for. I haven't (yet) tried any entree items but they sound great. ...  ... So... on the negative side, the only thing I can say is I wish they took reservations.  I use OpenTable at the other North, which is super convenient.  At this location, you have to come in and put your name on the list.  Waits have averaged 30 minutes or so, so plan for that.
21	4	1	1	1	Hello hot bartender Ron. Mmmm. I love the vibe in North, and how unique of a restaurant it is. Kinda barn looking on the outside, with servers all dressed in button up plaid shirts. So cute. ...  ... An interesting cocktail menu and small starters of crispy chickpeas and fruity olives got me going. I wish they had more vegetarian/cheese free items on the menu.... The pizza my friend ordered was good, at least the portion of crust I tried anyway. Nice and chewy and not burnt. Dessert of fall apple crumble was insanely good but also insanely small of a portion  ...  : / coulda eaten buckets of it. Will definitely go back
21	5	0	0	0	Love love love this place! The zucca chips = addicting...which is weird...don't see how those were so addicting, but hey, definitely a great snack. I definitely want to try the bread next time though... ...  ... The entrees my friends and I had were amazing! My friend got the Tortellini... so yummy! I just wish they provided more of it, I felt bad since I ate more of hers than mine (har har). I got the gnocchi, it was not bad, I have never had gnocchi before so I don't think I will be getting that again. My other friend got the pork with apples on top? I am horrible at describing things at the moment. Anyways, that was really good too, but the pork had a little too much fat so it was kind of a bummer.  ...  ... I love the atmosphere too and how they have the open kitchen, but I will say this.. I did not see the hot bartender Ron!  :( I just saw very very very short guys  :( :( ...  ... All love though haha.
21	5	0	0	0	Shhhhhh!    The best breakfast in arcadia
21	5	0	0	0	This place has a nice twist on Italian.  The atmosphere is great its wide open.  You can see everything in the kitchen from meats being cut to things being cooked, there should be an Food Network focus show done here!  The lighting is wonderful, I even picked up some interior design ideas.  The food was extremely tasty, a little on the salty side,  but it probably was the pruiscuitto.   The wait staff is extremely friendly and there is complementary valet.  North, I've made a new friend, I'm excited to get to know you and your menu in the future and develop a tasty culinary relationship.  FYI-this is a great date place.  It will delight your date as its not trite.
21	2	1	0	0	Eh... pasta is way to salty.  Just just cause Mario B says cook your pasta in salt water, doesn't mean you have too and then dump salty sauce on top of it.  Tried to tell the manager but got blown off.  Just because you work for FRC doesn't mean you know what good food is.  Also, pizza greasy.
21	5	0	0	0	Had the bread plate for an appetizer, with a pizza as the main course. Awesome tasted throughout the meal. Service by Kim was awesome too. Great atmosphere, love the fact it all used to be an old carwash!
21	1	0	2	0	Don't waste your time or money. Ordered $18 ravioli that tasted average but EXTREMELY MISERLY portions. About 10-12 ravioli total. I was embarrassed when they brought me my food. Anyone who orders this dish is leaving hungry. Luckily there is a jackinthebox down the street. Wrote an email to Fox expressing my discontent and surprise, no response. I cannot recommend this overpriced, average taste, miserly portioned restaurant.
21	3	1	0	0	First and foremost this one is very different from the North in Kierland.  Which I have decided I prefer actually. ...  ... A few of my friends and I decided it was amazing patio weather so we decided to sit outside at North. While the dirt floor outside patio is a nice idea it is messy. It has your shoes covered in dirt, not good for OCD girls with open toed expensive shoes. ...  ... We got the chef board as an app which had 2 cheeses, bread, thin sliced salami, peppers and some spiced nuts.  The salami was sliced super thin which was nice for a change and had a spicy kick.  I would definitely get it again. ...  ... We also asked our waitress (who was super nice) if they had a specials.  She recommended a sauvignon blanc wine which we decided to try, not knowing that it was $52 a bottle til we got the surprise on our receipt.  Our mistake, but I could hardly call that a special. ...  ... Best part was overhearing the guy get his burnt pizza delivered next to us a slice missing.  The waiter had been bumped, a slice fell down he brought that pizza missing slice and all to the customer saying that a new one was on its way.
21	4	0	0	0	Had a lovely brunch here and can't wait to go back for dinner. I had the fried egg sandwich which was delicious. My fiance had the frittata because he wanted as much veg as possible after his morning run. I enjoyed my sandwich so much that I didn't get a taste of his frittata. The ambiance was great and we had a bottle of Prosecco to enjoy over a leisurely brunch. I wished I had room for something sweet because a lady near us got the apple pie looking thing and it smelled so good. We debated getting a cinnamon roll to go but another diner near us had a half eaten one left on a plate which signaled to me that it was not to die for. So I passed.  ...  ... My two complaints about the experience were: ... 1. The parking. was. ridiculous. There was a mostly empty lot but we were forced to use the "complimentary" valet. Complimentary my ass. You have to tip. That is not "complimentary". They should allow patrons to park themselves if the restaurant lot is less than half full. Otherwise... I might choose to go somewhere else that doesn't rip me off and waste my time with this nonsense. Seriously, I almost asked him to hand me the keys because the car was 20 feet away. Not cool.  ...  ... 2. The bowl for the potatoes with the egg sandwich is beautiful. However, it is not functional. It scoots all over the plate when you try to get a bite and it wobbles like crazy. Frustrating, because the potatoes were delicious but went unfinished because they were such a pain to eat.
21	2	1	2	0	NORTH FATTORIA ITALIANA (aka NoRTH Arcadia) misses the mark!!! ... All I got here was slight heartburn & Dirty Shoes & Pants! ...  ... How can a Sam Fox concept restaurant,  headed up by the former NOCA chef, Chris Curtiss miss the mark? If your a total Foodie like me, & you like Sauce - Pizza & Wine, olive & ivy, & Bloom you might be in for some disappointment! ...  ... When this restaurant was going up I had high hopes for it to be a neighborhood hang out. After all we have a few good restaurants in our neighborhood so one more adds to the selection of my favorite Arcadia hang-outs, and a Sam Fox Concept Restaurant in between Chelsea's Kitchen, The Grind, & LGO should only help minimize the wait time to get a table in any of these awesome eateries!(Woo-Hoo!!!) ...  ... Now who puts up a freestanding down to earth restaurant (as it's marketed) next door to U-haul, and only offers valet parking? (WTF!) ...  ... Oh yeah, the dirt floor outside patio as organic as it may look will cover your Italian loafers and nicely pressed Slacks in dirt! Seriously, not a good idea for couples on dates in their Sunday best, and expensive shoes. You can pretty much assume if you have a nice automobile that you will valet park, you are going to be dressed to impress, and when you leave dinner to go clubbing or  to your favorite watering whole you will look like a F--king  hobo!  ...  ... Here is a suggestion, shoot your Architect & get either the guy who did The Parlor on Camelback or the Grind, and  fix not only the Patio, but also the dinning room! Your dinning room is not just Loud, but also very badly designed! (Seriously!) ...  ... The Arcadia NoRTH menu is based upon interpretation of traditional Italian cuisine, and is OK, but nothing here is making me say "I'm craving NoRTH!"  ... To be really frank, I like the Pizza and deserts @ LGO/PIZZARIA much better!!!  ... Sorry Sam but like Radio Milano the snob factor is much higher here than the dinning elegance that your menu pricing warrants! ...  ... NoRTH Arcadia (aka NORTH FATTORIA ITALIANA) is another upscale traditional Italian cuisine restaurant with the promise of authentic dishes without the "snob factor!"  ...  ... The 4th time in the last ten years this restaurant concept has been tried in our neighborhood!!! Like the last 3 times I have to say this I don't see that special little something, "je ne sais quoi."
21	4	1	1	0	North, quasi-contemporary Italian?  ...  ... That's the best description I could give you, but here's the review. ...  ... My wife and I really did enjoy the atmosphere, the open floorplan offers a community based feeling when eating. If you like your privacy, this is not the place for you. we loved the wide open kitchen and we really appreciate the freshly shaven meats. We didn't expect much when trying this new restaurant, thankfully they have valet parking because finding a spot would have been tough without it. The building seemed to be thrown up overnight and I'm not too sure how they are going to keep it cool in the summer, but during these few nice months the temperature was perfect to have the large windows completely open. It is a grand dining room, and by that I mean that there are no formal rooms, everything's located in one large area.  ...  ... The food was good for Ameritalian. The chefs tray of meats and cheeses was great and I would recomment it to be ordered, The meats are all finely shaven. ...  ...  I would personally not suggest the Gnocchi if you appreciate good gnocchi, it missed the mark, a little mushy for my liking.  ...  ... The pizzas were very good but again, no originality there ...  ... Overall, I would call it a good restaurant in this world of quick opening and the service was very acceptable. Only real problem I see with this restaurant is that if you are wearing a dark flannel shirt, someone may stop you on the way to the toilet and ask for some bread because all the servers all wear dark flannel shirts.
21	5	0	0	0	Great 'birthday week' dinner with my mom, who had already been to North for lunch today.  Started with the burrata alla panna (AMAZING) and bread and cheese (quite good, but not as good as the burrata).  Then had the best salad ever...the heirloom beet salad.  I could eat that salad every day.  It's the perfect salad for me.   ...  ... Shared the tortolloni, which was good, but I wouldn't get it again, but am glad I tried it.  I will plan to try another pasta another time as the pasta itself was really good. ...  ... Shared the bombolini with my mom for dessert, which was good but we were too stuffed to really enjoy it.  However, lemon curd is always a good thing.   ...  ...  ... Nice atmosphere, close to home, free valet, good food.  I'll be back!
21	3	0	1	0	I had been to noRTH a few times both for dinner and happy hour and decided to I trounce a few friends to my new happy hour pic. I got there about 20 minutes early, got a table and ordered a glass of wine. It was very busy, loud and a bit crazy on that night. I waited for friends who called me to say that when they attempted to valet park, they were told the lot was full. They weren't offered an alternative. They decided to park in the lot of the sopping center to the west and were told by the security guard there that parking was not for the patrons of the restaurant and their cars would be towed if they parked there. They told me they'd meet me at Chelsea's kitchen. I told my waitress and had to cash out on the glass of wine that I hadn't even had a chance to try. I was furious! I left, the manager came out as I waited 15 minutes to get my car and she asked why I was leaving. I explained. She said that they could have parked at the circle k or 7 eleven or whatever is across the street and I asked why the valet hadn't told my friends that. She said she didn't know - was sorry-and that was it. Didn't comp the drink I didn't drink, I felt obliged to tip both the waitress and valet modestly but overall arrived almost a half an hour after my friends at Chelsea's and it was a very bad experience all around! I won't be meeting anyone there again. Although it only happened once out of four times there, once was enough!
21	2	0	0	0	I hate to  give 2 stars...however, I know i must be honest in my experience and 2 stars portrays it's perfectly.  I had high hopes for this place considering all the wonderful reviews, but I was not a satisfied customer this Sunday during their brunch. This is only a review on brunch.   ...  ... Service:  Mixed reviews.  First off, we walked into a 1/3 of a full restaurant with plenty of seating and prepared tables but were told it would be a 15 to 20 minute wait.  WHAT???  Why not seat us and at least give waiting patrons drinks.  We figured it was short staffed and thought we would just grab a coffee at the bar that had 3 servers behind it and less than half the seats filled.  Apparently that was not going to happen smoothly.  The bartender didn't acknowledge us and when she did decide to help a customer it was one that came after us.  Already, a bad taste in my mouth.  Once she deiced to ask what we needed (a simple request for coffee), she asked her two colleagues to take care of it who then mumbled under their breath that they didn't wish to.  Possibly it was dissension between the three of them, but why make the customer aware of it.  In the end, we got seated before the three of them could decide who was in charge there.  Our server at the table was great and he made up for our first 2 awful experiences.  He was upbeat and knowledgeable.  Thank goodness. ...  ... Food:  Maybe I'm becoming a food snob, but North does not seem to have authentically made food.  It taste loaded with fat, salt and sugar.   I ordered something simple...Irish Oats with Apples with a side of scrabbled eggs and garlic toast.  The Irish Oats were very sweet but I will say I did love the whipped maple brown sugar mouse but realized they forgot to add the apples.. no big deal.  I just asked the waiter about it and very sweetly offered to bring me a side of them.  He then brought me another bowl of the oats which he didn't have to do so I thought it was a kind gesture.  However, as in the first bowl it was missing another ingredient..the candied pecans.  Somehow one ingredient goes missing.  :)  No harm, no foul, but just odd.  In addition, neither bowl was hot.  The second issue were with my eggs.  How can you mess up scrambled eggs??  The were LOADED with salt.  I assume it has to be an error since most restaurants let you salt your own eggs.  These salty eggs were certainly inedible. On the plus side, their garlic toast was pretty tasty.   ...  ... I don't think I'll be back to North.  If I do return it will be to try their dinner menu and of course if I have a better experience I'll update this review.  Their breakfast and their service I will choose to pass on.
21	2	1	2	0	I hate writing bad reviews and I try to find the best in the places I go to. There were just too many problems with our brunch at North. The best way for me to explain the 2 stars is to give you a breakdown of our experience.  ...  ... We arrived at North and right away I have to say that I liked the look of the place. Very cool barn design with tons of windows and a bar that is very inviting. Well things changed as soon as we went in. First off the place was maybe 30% full so there was a ton of seating. We were shocked to hear that there was a 15 minute wait. Now I know a little about the restaurant business and it could have very well been that they were short staffed. I still think it is a much better experience for people to be seated and explain your situation.  ...  ... While we were waiting outside I decided to go to the bar to get some coffee for us. The bartender didn't acknowledge me and instead decided to help the people that came in after me. I moved down the bar hoping it was because she didn't see me. Well that wasn't it because I got another 5 minutes of her avoiding me like I was Kris Humphries at a Kardashian family reunion.  ...  ... Finally she took my order to which she tried having two other people fulfill it. Needless to say we were seated before I even got the coffee. Bad service. ...  ... Once we were seated things seemed to get better. We had a very nice waiter and he was very quick with getting us drinks and our order. When the food arrived things went downhill again.  ...  ... My girlfriends eggs were so salty her blood pressure went from 110/60 to 180/120. She only had one bite. Her oatmeal was also missing apples which was a big part of it. She was very disappointed. Mine wasn't much better. My breakfast sandwich is something I could make at home. Very plain roll with overcooked fried egg and two skinny pieces of bacon.  The potatoes were fantastic though. Odd they give you a thick aioli that ruins the potato. Just avoid it. ...  ... I can only review this place on its brunch. I haven't been here for dinner and not really sure I will give it another try. The service from the bartender and the very sub-par food makes me want to spend my money elsewhere. There are too many great restaurants in Phoenix that appreciate the business.
21	4	0	1	0	Tried this for lunch one day with a girlfriend. Neither of us had been before. We split the heirloom beet salad and the grilled chicken sandwich. Both were excellent. Service was good and I would definitley go back. It was nice sitting outside and the only negative I have is that the slatted chairs were uncomfortable. I would like to go back just for dessert since the menu looked really good.
21	4	0	1	0	NoRTH is my new favorite go to spot for lunch and dinner.  The atmosphere is wonderful -- country themed, open, fresh and clean.  I have travelled throughout Italy several times and have found NoRTH's food to be the closest thing to being there.  They have captured the flavors so well.  They have super friendly staff that are engaging and welcoming. ...  ... Only down side that I have experienced is the valet.  One time the valet left and instead of locating me in the restaurant, he left my key sitting on the corner of the bar.  This is not acceptable to me.  If you only have valet parking available, make sure they are servicing your customers they way you insist your wait staff service your customers. ...  ... Don't let that stop you from going though.  Your palet will be please you went.
21	5	0	1	1	Went to NoRTH this past week with friends, and our server Jody could not have been better - thanks Jody! The food was super yummy too. Check out the burrata appetizer- it's amazing! The gnocchi were little pillows of heaven, and the sea bass was good, but I actually liked the veggies on top of it more! How fun is that? We had a couple bottles of an Italian wine too, and that was all the better when we asked for stemmed glasses instead of the short glasses that they usually use. We'll be back sooner rather than later.
21	3	0	1	0	This would actually be another 2.5 Star experience but I went ahead and rounded it up to 3 stars since I am in a good mood.  We came here after going to Chelsea's Kitchen down the street which was super packed for the night.  I easily get annoyed with complementary valet parking because I hardly ever carry cash and feel weird if I do not tip the valet boys and girls but I digress.... ...  ... The concept and look of this place is really fun and different.  I felt like I was in a modern barn.  We walked in and put our name on the list and was surprised that it is all done by an i-Pad and you receive a text message when your table is ready.  Good thing the bf and I remembered our phones or else we would have been out of luck.  The wait wasn't horrible.  We went to the bar and got a couple of glasses of wine, the bartenders didn't seem really in a hurry to help us which got me a little annoyed. ...  ... We were seated in a cozy, and I mean cozy 2 top table right in a main traffic way.  My bf and I are not big people and felt uncomfortable in the size of the table.  I know you want to pack a lot of tables in a small space but at the expense of the customer?  Our waiter was friendly enough but not as friendly as he was to the group of women that was seated next to us.... nothing like treating all your tables equal huh? ...  ... We ordered an appetizer, the zucca chips, which had a decent flavor but were a little burnt.  We ordered out main dishes which were a chicken dish and their version of spaghetti and meatballs.  The wait for the food wasn't bad either but I hate when you as the customer have to ask for a wine list because your wine was empty for 10 minutes but the waiter didn't ask if you wanted anything else because he was focused on the table of 5 women next to us sharing an appetizer.   ...  ... I had the pasta and meatballs, which was me'h.  The pasta was a little mushy and the meatballs really didnt have much flavor.  My bf had the chicken dish with spinach which he loved!  All in all the experience wasn't bad but wasn't good.  Maybe they are still working out their kinks but this place probably won't be high on my list to return any time soon!
21	4	0	0	0	Food was decent, drinks were good -- and other than my date's $15 glasses of pinot noir, drinks were not too overpriced.  However, for some reason the outdoor patio was closed on this beautiful evening. ...  ... I'd definitely go back, but I'd make my date pay next time ;)
21	4	4	7	9	I've been to North a few times in the past month. I really like the open air feeling of the restaurant. It is amazing that this cute Italian farm house used to be an old car wash.  ...  ... The staff is pretty awesome and I have always enjoyed the food. Last time for breakfast I had the egg scramble, it was a beautiful surprise of fluffy eggs hugging asparagus and peas. I devoured the entire thing.   ...  ... The happy hour is amazing, it is Monday-Friday 3-6 PM and All-Day Sunday. Last time for happy hour I got the $2 spicy nuts, $2 green olives and $5 chardonnay. Can't beat that.. I have to hand it to Sam Fox, he's scored again.
21	2	0	1	1	After last evening's dinner at North in Arcadia I think I can claim I've hit most of Sam Fox's valley restaurant concepts. While I admire the man's business acumen (build in trendy areas, gentrify via menu name and cooking process what otherwise is a limit selection of food choices, and make sure diners in the dining areas have direct line of sight to the bar), the actual food at any of them is forgettable. North is no different really; it does not offer anything all that wonderful to talk about. The food, essentially, is of medium catering quality. We three diners (encouraged by our server) started with an anti-pasti board of two cheeses, spicy nuts, some kind of chutney, sourdough bread & salt-cured beef. It was alright, but I could have put something this it together at home from groceries picked-up at Trader Joes that would have been better. Two of us had the same (housemade) pasta dish, while one went for the mussels and roast potatoes (both appetizers). We were all underwhelmed by the quality of the ingredients and the flavor. Maybe we made the wrong choices, but we'll never know because we're not going back.
21	4	0	0	0	Went back again for dinner.  The Gigli Pasta was the bomb!  Pasta with pesto, pine nuts and capers!  A hint of lime.  SUPER!  Had to fend off my tablemates sneaky forks. ... Service fantastic as always.
21	4	0	0	1	I'm starting to feel a special connection with Sam Fox just from eating at so many of his restaurants. One of his latest and greatest creations...NoRTH. ...  ... Apparently this used to be the location of a car wash, but you'd never know by the cool modern decor. It was pretty packed for an early dinner on a week night, but my party of 4 was lucky to score a table right away. ...  ... I'd recommend skipping the calamari because it was pretty disgusting, but the rest of our order was pretty awesome. Favorites including the zucca chips, meat and cheese plate and the spinach tortelloni. My goodness was that spinach tortelloni good. My buddy Sam knew what he was doing when he put that on the menu.  Actually based on my experiences in Phoenix Sam knows what he's doing when it comes to any restaurant!
21	2	0	4	0	The dilapitated carwash-turned-trattoria is a cute concept and was executed well. Almost feels "local" except for the fact that it's a Fox concept restaurant and carries the same inauthentic atmosphere as the rest. They did a very nice job reonvating this space and gave it some great curb appeal. But it lacks the true Arcadia genuineness present at it's neighbors' establishments. It's in the food, it's in the people. It's not in NoRTH. ...  ... My experiences have been mixed. The first visit was very nice - just there for some small bites and wine. We sat at the bar and the bartenders were incredibly friendly. Food was slightly above mediocre though incredibly salty and oily. Second visit - not so nice. Called ahead to see if they allowed dogs. The hostess put me on hold to confirm and came back with a yes. When we arrived, we were met with a "um, no." They (the manager) were a little (or a lot) snooty about it, so my third visit took a while to come around. Similar to the first with mediocre results. ...  ... The bar is beautious with friendly bartenders, so I haven't even bothered with waiting for a table. The front staff always seems a little annoyed that we're even walking in like "I guess we can be bothered to seat you" which is why we always just help ourselves to the bar. It's close to home with all day happy hour on Sundays (decent wine), so I'll probably be back eventually. But only if I'm eager to have one of those "stumble home in a wine stupor" nights.
21	5	0	1	0	It was teachers appreciation week and I went to NoRTH with 5 other people ( we are all teachers) for happy hour.  The appetizers were wonderful- pizza of the day (arugula) as well as meatballs.  We also ordered fried rice balls which were AMAZING!  ...  ... For entrees ordered a few more pizzas which were all very delicious!  When I casually mentioned to our waiter Sean that it was teacher appreciation week, he said dessert was on him, and we choose three wonderful desserts.  After that the manager (forgot his name) came over  to thank us(as teachers) for what we do ,we def. needed that after a hard week at work! ...  ... A big thank to Sean and the staff at NorTH for a wonderful evening!   ...  ... We never have a bad meal at a Fox Restaurant and this was no exception.
21	4	0	0	0	Great food, casual atmosphere. The staff was very friendly. I will definitely return the next time I am in town.
21	2	1	5	0	One WORD comes to mind...FLIES!!! (FYI we were inside not on the patio)  The whole dinner was spent swatting at the nasty creatures.  Seriously, no exaggeration THE WHOLE DINNER was one hand swatting away flies and one hand trying to eat.  Evidently the little buggers can not resist steamed mussels. ( I will get to the food part of my review in a second)   Also, I am not a big fan of mandatory valet parking.   No wait, I am pretty sure I don't like mandatory ANYTHING when I go out to eat.   Not even the having to pay part, but I have come to accept this as normal now when dining out.    ...  ... OK, on to the food.   I thought the food was AWESOME.  The aforementioned mussels were plump and cooked to perfection.  We had a wood-fired pizza with fresh dough that was yummy.   There is this thing called a Chef's Board that I highly recommend (If you are still bent on going in the first place) The dessert was a warm Nutella cake with vanilla gelato and coffee cream with bits of coffee bean in it. Now THAT was a delicious way to end a meal.   Our server was excellent as well.   ...  ... Bottom line is: I am not going back and I am saddened by that since the food was so good and so was my server.
21	3	1	3	0	Went for lunch here today for the first time ever.  Atmosphere was nice, Sleek and streamlined. Not fussy.  The menu was simple but a little pricey. Average lunch for one with an ice tea will run you $30.  Waiter was nice, knowledgable and friendly. Love the open kitchen concept. Live music from 11am to 1pm on Saturday. Also a brunch menu.  I ordered a pizza and the Zuchinni chips. Very tasty!      The one and only and HUGE downfall is the infestation of FLIES!!!!!!!  It really made our entire lunch unenjoyable!   When we complained to the waiter about the flies, he commented by saying, "Yeah, everybody has been complaining about that" then he went on to say how this year flies are supposed to be the worst ever in history.  So, should I take that as a hint, that of I eat here again I will have to share my food with the fly family ??!!!!     There are too many great places I can eat in this area that I don't need to deal with swooshing flies off of my food every three seconds! So unappetizing and it can't be sanitary especially with the open kitchen concept and the fact that veggies were stacked in open bins on the prep table and bread was stacked in the open air.  Hopefully I won't be picking baby bot flies out of my neck in a few months.   I don't think I will be back.  It is a shame because everything else was great.  Although, Jeff Goldblum would love the place I think!
21	3	0	2	0	I met a g/f here for Happy Hour.  We had their Simple salad and Patata pizza.  Both were just ok.  The food was ok.  The service was ok.  Everything about this place was just ok.  I don't feel a burning desire to go back.
21	3	0	1	1	I'd love to give this Fox effort a higher rating because of the concept, location, reasonably priced happy hours and above average food, however; due to repeated exposure on the patio, I must say I hope you are not looking for immediate service. The management and staff are actually very nice, but at times, it's difficult to get some attention. The beet salad is one of my recommendations should you visit. I still frequent there often. Maybe they will work this out. The happy hour is a good time to try this place for the first time.
21	4	0	0	0	Another great Fox Concepts Restaurant...no surprise here!  The space is absolutely great - amazingly bright and open.  The service is extremely quick at lunch which is much appreciated.  And...the food was great!  My pasta was flavorful and just the right portion.  I am confident this place will be a huge success and imagine it is pretty hard to get a table at peak times.
21	5	0	3	0	Amazing! ... I ordered the Spinach Tortelloni and the ricotta filling was bursting at the seams, drenched in herb-butter sauce. Oh, it was divine! ... We went here on a double-date and sat on the patio. There was no dirt involved, or flies, as some of the reviews suggest. In fact, it was impeccably clean, well-designed and relaxing. We went on a Tuesday night, so it was not very busy. ... I am a fan of all Sam Fox's Restaurant Concepts, and this one did not disappoint!
21	4	0	1	0	Great pasta! And happy hour is all day Sunday. The food is very rich though so I caution taking your time eating
21	4	0	0	0	One of my customers brought me here. I ended up paying however. No problem he is a very important customer. Restaurant was bright open very clean. The bartender had to be in his late 40's...with a mo-hawk hair do, to each his own. I want to go back because I didn't have time to explore the menu. I know homemade Italian...I had the burger. It was highly recommended, and very delicious. Amazing place can't wait to take my wife.
21	4	0	1	0	Great food!  Pizza is excellent!  Very loud inside though.  Fox Restaurants are usually only "OK" and "Nothing Special".  HOWEVER, this one is actually REALLY good!!  Been there a couple times now and will be going back again!  By far the BEST Fox restaurant yet!
21	3	1	3	0	Good food; Bad Flies; So-So Service. ...  ... Tried this place with my family after the June 2012 write-up in Phoenix Magazine.  The restaurant was a little odd to find and the mandatory valet was interesting, but the interior is amazing.  The person(s) who did the building and interior design did a superb job-- the spot is very open, the revealed kitchen is fun (especially for an interested 4 year-old), and the artistic touches and lighting fit perfectly.  Not often I take notice of these kinds of things, but this is an exceptional concept place that way. ...  ... We tried the Chef's Board, Burrata Alla Panna (asparagus), Mafaldine (rock shrimp and long noodles), Margherita pizza, and buttered noodles. All were very good, though not remarkable.  Bread is for-charge and the water has an "interesting" taste. ...  ... The most offending thing was the flies.  We're talking lots of them.  And big ones.  And so persistent you might as well pull them up a chair and plate.   ...  ... When your little kid asks why there are so many flies an why they have red stripes and such big eyes, something went awry.  A kid should not notice the exoskeletonal features of insects at a nice restaurant.  Odd to constantly brush the flies away, just look around to see every other table doing the same.  It proved to b a sad, asynchronous dance for would-be happy diners.  We skipped dessert just to get away from the bothersome diptera.  If only the service staff was as attentive! ...  ... Waitress was middling at best.  Drinks were left unfilled for long periods.  Two plates came out too hot while the pizza was just warm-- our daughter's dish came out so hot that she would have burnt her mouth had my wife not tested first (and singed her tongue).  I also had to ask if there were specials because it wasn't volunteered... Maybe specials are a private and fabulous secret, here.  I didn't order the special soup, so not sure if it was indeed nirvana. ...  ... Would visit again if there was reason, but my wife and I agreed walking out that it wouldn't be worth a trip on its own.
21	5	0	1	0	I have been driving by this place for months now, always thinking that I would like to try it out as it looked intriguing even from the outside. Last night my boyfriend and I were in the neighborhood and on a whim decided to give it a try. We will definitely be back! ... I do love the open concept of the restaurant. It is quite spacious inside, which was nice, since it allowed us to be seated right away on a Friday night at 7:30, yet it still felt cozy enough to be romantic. The wait staff was very prompt and friendly and very helpful when it came to recommending food. I love the fact that they make their own pasta and sausage, by the way, and had to try both - one in the form of the pork belly gnocci, the other as their sausage pizza. Both were so delicious, that we finished every last morsel on our plates. We even decided to give the desserts a try and had the salted caramel something or the other, which was a wonderful combination of flavors.  ... The one minus, and it is a small one, is that both my boyfriend and I smelled like food, as you are literally sitting in the kitchen. But it is a price I am very willing to pay again and again!
21	3	0	1	0	The Arcadia neighborhood just keeps getting cooler. NoRTH is a Sam Fox restaurant whose concept is different from what you may be familiar with already from the north Scottsdale location.  ...  ... Everything from the restaurant's decor (modeled after an Italian farmhouse) to the servers' uniforms (plaid shirts) to the menu (traditional Italian) is completely different from the NoRTH in Scottsdale. Our bartender told us this NoRTH is nicknamed "NoRTH 40," and this new restaurant reflects where Fox is going with the brand, which already has five existing locations throughout the country. ...  ... The restaurant is open and airy, with one big, well-lit dining room with an open kitchen and exposed metal beams. The eatery had a good energy to it and was bustling with lots of conversation and alternative music playing in the background. There's a bar connecting the dining room to the patio, with the bar wrapping around the back of the restaurant and featuring television screens on either side. The patio has a picnic vibe to it, with tables set atop a dirt ground and a section of seats one level below the patio for lounging. The patio sort of reminded me of fellow Arcadia spot La Grande Orange's patio, but I didn't like the dirt flooring-it was too minimalist to me, and I felt like it could have been so much prettier, especially considering the high quality of the menu. ...  ... That was my general dilemma with NoRTH-while the vibe there is casual, the menu features handmade, downright fancy food-served to you by people who look like they just stepped out of Urban Outfitters. NoRTH was too busy to be considered romantic, but some menu items cost $20 or more, with the pastas and entree dishes ranging from $14-$26. I guess for the affluent people who inhabit the Arcadia neighborhood, NoRTH could be their casual dining destination, though I'm still trying to figure out what type of occasion I would return for dinner. ...  ... My favorite part about NoRTH was the food. I am not really into the whole plaid uniform thing (and that's exactly the type of style nearby Postino servers have been rocking long before), and there was nothing compelling about the atmosphere that stood out to me-and this is one patio I'd never request to sit on even though I always prefer to sit outside. That said, the food was delicious, and the cocktails were strong, though I thought the menu was better suited for a classier atmosphere. ...  ... Drinkwise, I had the Ducati ($9) a small but powerful drink made with Grappa, Hornitos Anejo Tequila, Solerno Blood Orange and agave. It tasted refreshing but strong, so I made my next Ducati tall with added soda water. If strong drinks aren't your thing, I highly recommend doing this, because the second drink was way better than the first but packed the same punch. ...  ... I also tried my companion's "Old Roma" ($9), made with Courvoisier, Cointreau, lemon and mint. This drink was even stronger than my original Ducati, but my pal said he loved it because he also found it refreshing. ...  ... He also got a Quiet Italian Gentleman ($10), with Bulleit Rye, Disaronno amaretto, Campari and Carpano Antiqua. This tasted like cough syrup to me, and I could barely take a sip, but he loved it. Just be warned-all their cocktails are amazingly strong and well worth the price for the amount of alcohol you get. ...  ... To begin the meal, we had a Grilled Portabella ($8), with arugula and shaved grana padano. This was a wonderful dish, with super-fresh greens and cheese that perfectly complemented the mushroom. It wasn't the most filling appetizer, but it was wonderfully made and tasted great. ...  ... For my entree, I got the Agnolotti ($15), pasta made with ricotta, mascarpone, pecorino, grana padano and herb butter. I savored every bite of this pasta that was obviously handmade. I thought it was delicious, and it's great the restaurant had such high-quality ingredients and preparation. ...  ... My pal got the Mafaldine ($17), made with spicy rock shrimp, white wine, shaved fennel, tomato, garlic, chili and basil. His dish looked and smelled amazing. ...  ... It was hard to beat the tastiness of the main course, but our "Affogato" desserts ($6) did just that. Vanilla gelato was topped with coffee creme and served atop melted chocolate, and I loved every bit of it. This was the first time I've ever had a dessert like this, and it was so yummy. ...  ... While I probably wouldn't come back to NoRTH Arcadia for dinner because the ambiance just doesn't jive with the menu to me, I think it's a great lunch option if you're in the area. Their lunch menu includes sandwiches ranging between $9-$11 in addition to the dinner pastas offered, and I bet the restaurant is beautiful during the day because of how much sun comes in.
21	3	0	1	0	Well, it has a long fancy name, but I just call it North. Or is it NoRTH? ...  ... Anyway, it's an airy barn of a building with a delicious door-to-bar-to-patio layout. Oh, and there's a restaurant with seating and stuff too. But you have to turn left for that. ...  ... Thank goodness for the valet. Like Chelsea's, it's nice if you can score a spot early, but let them help you otherwise! ...  ... Maybe skip the white sangria - it was made to order and lacked the depth of a proper sangria, but wasn't potent enough to call a cocktail. Luckily, the other house cocktails are worth writing home about, some even come with an exotic floral garnish. ...  ... The salad was enough to share between two, but we should have then shared a pasta dish or gone for the cheese plate. The pizza we ordered was bland, the crust uninspired, but I might try it again anyway... with my own reorganizing of the toppings, perhaps?! ...  ... The staff is attentive, and knowledgeable. The decor to menu is a comfortable match (not always the strongest point of a Fox concept). And the crowd is pleasantly neighborhoody and good for people watching.
21	5	0	0	0	After coming away from NoRTH on North Scottsdale Rd. with a bland, over priced experience, we were wary when invited to this location. As soon as we arrived it was night and day difference. Parking is ridiculous and the place gets very crowded but after tasting the food you will know why.  ...  ... We started with pork belly which is simply amazing. Honestly just delicious. We followed up with a round of pastas. I ordered the tagliatelle which is some of the best pasta I have had in my life. It is all made fresh in the open air kitchen - you can glance over and see it being made. NOTHING beats minutes old pasta in my book. The freshness elevates everything on the menu. Others had bucatini (think a thick spaghetti with a little bite) with meatballs - simple and delicious.  ...  ... For dessert we had the salted caramel which was surprisingly perfect for a shared item. All in all just really great food and a  unique atmosphere. We brought others back on a second visit and everything again exceeded our expectations.  ...  ... Takeaway: Skip the north NoRTH location and hit this one up. Its worth the parking headaches and the food is top notch.
21	4	0	0	0	First I have to say that I've only been once and only had appetizers (several as I was with a group on business). We had cocktails, pizzas, and several of their cheese and meat trays. ...  ... I wasn't excited to go as I used to have a North in my neighborhood in Glendale and was not impressed. I've also been to the Scottsdale location and the white leather, super modern motif doesn't really do it for me. The food was always "just ok" too, especially for the price. ...  ... Things have changed. The North in Arcadia is set up to look like a rustic Italian kitchen. I give major kudos for the pasta being freshly made by hand. ...  ... The cocktails I was having (called the Quiet Italian Gentleman) were a fantastic mix of rye, amaretto, and two other Italian liquors. Yum! ...  ... Another cool note is that they use a hand cranked deli slicer to slice their meats in order not to melt the wonderful fats in the meat. I've never seen this before and enjoyed the touch. ...  ... Pizzas were fair to good, but pizza is a tough nut to crack. I think I had every meat and cheese they offered. Every one was quite nice. ...  ... The only draw back was that it was HOT inside, which is apparently a problem as the manager came by to advise that an additional unit is being installed so this shouldn't be an issue going forward. ...  ... Our server was also excellent. ...  ... I'll be back. ...  ... PS Parking is valet only, which annoys some people. Not me since it is complementary and makes me feel special so its worth the couple buck tip.
21	4	0	0	0	Delicious pizza!! I was blown away by the fresh flavors, soft delicate cheese, crispy crust! Mussels were brought out with warm char grilled bread to mop up the lucious broth. The service was incredible also, we were in a rush and were served our meal with check AND food packed to go within 30 minutes (all per our request) and with a smile on our servers face.  ...  ...  ... excellent, just plain excellent.
21	5	7	3	3	The beverage menu read; 'Cheap Cans $2.00'.  ...  ... Cheap cans, as I incorrectly surmised was not an older woman named Waynette, whose once youthful 34D's had now fallen victim to gravity. Well, gravity and her recently deceased husband, Sid, overly-motorboating them throughout the years.  ... Lucinda, with no place to call home save for a stolen shopping cart, is waved in from the alley by your server to flash her 42 longs at you. And for all of two bucks! ... Boy, was I ever wrong. ...  ... Actually, Cheap Cans, as the server informed, is whatever they feel like serving on any given day. Some days Red Stripe tall-boys, others, PBR. ... Last night it was tall boys. ...  ... Someone in our party ordered appys, but I have no idea what it was called. I was too busy ruminating on the whole cheap cans thing. It was ten bucks and it had olives, cheese, pickled peppers, salami, hot salami, crusty bread and hot peanuts. ...  ... Two tall boys in, I dispensed with any graciousness and just started grabbing at anything i could get my hands on before the others beat me to it.  ...  ... I suppose this is one reviewer's way of saying it was damned tasty stuff, whatever it was.
21	4	0	1	0	Came for a HH and stayed for dinner.  I really enjoy the atmosphere (minus the fact that it was very warm and a little too loud), but I really like walking in and seeing the large windows and open kitchen.  It's almost like walking in to fancy barn or greenhouse with tables inside!  Tables can be put together to accommodate large crowds and the service was very good.   ...  ... We ordered a pizza that had mozzarella, eggplant and garlic, and the malfadine (rock shrimp, home made pasta, delicious!) which were both very good.  Hopefully they'll fix their air conditioning issue (or maybe I'll just wait to go when it's not 118 outside!).  But I'll be back for some more fresh Italian goodness. ...  ... Note: there is no parking, and is valet only, but at least its complimentary!
21	5	0	0	0	Went with a friend early on a Sat. (6pm) for dinner.  I'm glad we went a little early because the place filled up fast. ...  ... Wait staff/service:  Welcomed by a staff member actually opening the door for me (nice touch).  Promptly seated.  Our waitress was very knowledgeable of the wine list and menu.  The waitress was also perfect in her timing...checked in enough to make sure we were happy, but not too much as to make you feel rushed. ...  ... Food/Drinks:  My friend had the house Pinot Grigio and I had a Negroni Nuovo (these things could be dangerous...a great drink for a summer day).  We split Antipasti (bread & cheese...this was yummy, although the name could be improved) and Insalate (Italian...also a boring menu name, but was tasty as well).  We both had pasta for our main course...Tagliatelle and Ricotta Gnocchi.  Both of us thought the pasta was delicious...perfectly cooked and very flavorful. ...  ... Dessert:  We split the Salted Carmel Budino.  It was so good, I almost ordered one to go.  Rich as Budino should be, but light enough so as not to put you in an after dinner coma. ...  ... Price:  If you want to try the traditional multi-course Italian meal, the prices can add up.  Our meal for 2 came to ~$110 (including 1 drink each and the tip).  For a casual dining atmosphere, some may consider this too pricey. ...  ... Other comments:  I read other comments about a problem with flies.  This must have been overcome, because we didn't notice any.  This is a restaurant I will visit again to sample some of the other menu items.
21	3	0	0	0	I am a huge fan of North Kierland, but this was my first time at North Arcadia. Other than the decor of this restaurant (which was beautiful and cool) I was totally underwhelmed. We were there for lunch and we were about the 4th/5th table seated as we were there before 11:30.  There was nothing offensive, but the service was really slow and had a bit of an attitude. The zucca chips (one of my favorites at North Kierland) were over cooked. The $17 lunch portion of bucatini with meatballs was pretty small in size for the price. Nothing here was terrible, but out the door we were at $59.00 for 3 people for lunch with no drinks. Just saying you should go have a less than $20/person lunch at a much better place nearby like T. Cook's or Coup des Tartes.
21	2	0	1	0	I was visting Phoenix for the night and having dinner with my friend who lives in Arcadia.  I loved the look of this restaurant, which is very cool but left unimpressed with the food.  It was hoppin' on a Wednesday night and we luckily grabbed the only two open seats at the inside bar.  I had eyed someone's salad and immediately thought that is what I will be ordering.  ...  We started off with drinks.  I really liked the creativity with their drink menu. KD had the midnight shandy ($9.5) which she enjoyed.  Shandies are an interesting concept, incorporating beer and booze. It was so hot out that a nice light white wine sounded good to me.  I went with the vino di tavola- white.  A nice pinot grigio ($5).   ... We had the grilled summer squash ($7) for our starter.  There are yellow raisins included in a major way on this squash.  Raisins are not my thing and it's not mentioned on the menu about the raisins  but it was a tasty app.  I would've never gotten it though, had I been aware that raisins were in my near future.  ... I attempted to talk KD into splitting that salad I spied with me and also sharing the ricotta gnocchi but she did not take the bait.  She informed the gnocchi is very good but she wasn't in the mood for a heavy meal.  I ordered the casa salad ($8) and KD ordered the pork belly($12). The pork belly was very fatty so I passed on having a bite.  My casa salad was dreadful.  I was super duper disappointed.  It had burnt grilled bread on top.  When this was pointed out to our server, she had another plate of grilled bread brought out to us.  The salad had a strong, unappealing flavor.  Perhaps it was simply an off night for the house salad?  I love salads and Fox restaurants have some amazing salads. This was not one of them. ... I love my Sam Fox restaurants as much as the next person but this one was not a highlight for me.
21	4	0	0	1	I love the look of this place. Very open and inviting. Also great that they have complementary valet. ...  ... The decor is awesome! Very impressed. I loved that we could watch them make the fresh pasta and bread from our table.  ...  ... We stopped in for an early lunch on Labor Day, with our awesome Fox Restaurants 25% off coupon! Thank you! ...  ... We had hopped to get the brunch menu, but since it was Monday we had to go with the lunch menu, looked just as good tho, so no worries.  ...  ... We had this yummy cheese and bread appetizer, you must try it! Then we shared the salami panini and the other girls had a meat lovers looking pizza. Pretty much everything was gone from our plates so I think it is safe to say we all enjoyed the food.  ...  ... There is something for everyone here, nice bar, a TV to catch some sports, a nice patio facing the Arcadia neighborhood, and lots of space to push some tables together for a large party.  ...  ... What impressed me the most.... we arrived at 10:45 a.m. (we were for some reason thinking we were doing brunch) 15 minutes prior to them opening... and we were seated right away, they didn't even mention that we were early and they weren't open yet. Business as usual. Very nice, thank you!
21	2	0	0	0	Melissa, the waitress was very attentive, she was great.  Bloody marry needs improvement, drinks in general were lousy.  I'm still not impressed with the food.  Schucks.
21	5	0	0	0	OK, I've never liked any of the Fox concepts besides Sauce, and I left this place very pleased! Maybe the 5 star is a counter balance of how much disappointed I've been in the past at other places, but this place is great. It seems that italian is Fox's strong area. ...  ... The decor is cool, the integrated kitchen is appealing and all in all it's a great concept. ...  ... I had the cheff's board, 2 cheeses, 2 meats and some other goodies. The ultra thin slices of meat were tasteful and everything was good. Maybe a little bit of more cheese wouldn't hurt. ...  ... The pork belly was good. Not in the amazing side, but pretty decent. ...  ... I ordered spinach tortelloni and it was great, full of flavor and with grana padano, I mean, there's nothing not to love when it comes to grana padano. ...  ... The desert wasn't that great but maybe I was already full. ...  ... The double espresso was good.
21	5	0	0	0	we had a fantastic meal here with great service, food and ambiance.  we will be back.
21	4	0	0	0	Really great food and atmosphere. I love the cocktails here. You can't go wrong with any of the food. I think it is a little pricey for what you get and it's always crowded, but all around, you won't be mad you ate and/or drank here.
21	5	0	0	0	So this is my current Sunday All day Happy Hour JAM! ...  ... This place is SO GOOD and I'm not a huge fan of all off Fox Restaurants concepts. ...  ... The Chefs Pizza of the day hasn't let me down yet... We don't even ask we just order it!  The Chefs Board is pretty good too! My fav dish right now is the Broccolini - super simple but it's just so light / fresh and make sure you try the Bucatini & Meatballs if your their for happy hour.  ...  ... Awesome open feel to it - super friendly staff. The bartenders are great - I wanna say the dark haired brunets name was Nicole - works weekends & knows how to make a mean bloodymary / Red Rooster in their case.  ...  ... The parking / Valet situation is a little annoying but remember the sign says "Complimentary" not Mandatory - park your car yourself if you want.
21	5	1	0	0	This is my 2nd time at North and I must say that the quality of food for the price is great!  My server was Brian tonight as he made my our night that much better.. Brian is very friendly and really seems to enjoy working at this great establishment.  ...  ... This is a great place for a date, fun, hip, classy and very enjoyable!  ...  ... By the way, the Chef's Board and the Ducati drink are my favorites along with the Bucatini... ...  ... 5 stars all the way. ...  ... Thanks North!!!
21	4	0	0	0	We had such an amazing experience at North Fattoria Italiana last Saturday night! Service was exceptional and the food was fantastic! Our server Vanessa was friendly, courteous and knowledgeable and the manager came by to our table to make sure that everything was up to our expectations. We had house salads, crispy potatoes with pecorino & aioli, pizze stracciatella, tagliatelle with sauce bolognese, spinach tortelloni and the summer fruit crostata. If you haven't been to this neighborhood gem in Arcadia, make your reservations now!
21	3	0	2	0	Finally got a chance to hit up North in Arcadia last night. Nice addition to the area, fits right in with all of the other great places in the neighborhood. Met some other couples for drinks and dinner. Like most people who grew up here, obv not a fan of mandatory valet but oh well. Walking in, you're definitely struck by the amazing decor and it's certainly the highlight of this location. Big, open spaces, beautiful Italian farmhouse converted to a restaurant. Really stunning. ...  ... Sat at the bar for a while, it was packed and service was not as prompt as I'd like which was kind of a running theme for the rest of the night. Not a huge fan of the plaid shirts worn by the servers. They didn't really stand out and were hard to distinguish from the patrons sometimes. Finally, when we were moved to our table we just carried our drinks and a bottle of wine over, which I always think is funny when patrons are walking around a restaurant bottle of wine in hand... ...  ... Service was ok not great. 4 of the 5 couples in our group had never been to North but we never were given a run down of the restaurant or what is good or any of the normal stuff most servers give you when they first greet you. Never once did our server fill our wine glasses, and they tried to take my wife's dinner plate away before she was finished, and they actually did take mine away without even asking and I wasn't finished.  ...  ... Food was very good as you'd expect from a Fox restaurant. Had the Seasonal Vegetable Salad w/ chicken and it was great. Love the farro in it. Also had the prosciutto wrapped chicken, was a little disappointed in it. It was good, but I just expected something amazing I guess and it just seemed pretty standard. I didn't at all like the bed of spinach it was served on. It comes served in a large bowl and the bottom of the bowl was filled with the juice from the chicken and the spinach was just kind of wet and soggy. Seemed like a sloppy presentation. ...  ... Definitely would go back. I'm a huge sucker for beautiful spaces and this is one of my favorites in the valley. Everything else was just decent, but that isn't terrible so I'm happy for another good restaurant in the area.
21	4	1	3	3	KIM SAVES THE DAY! ...  ... It was a Friday evening and I was jonesing for some pizza.  I really wanted Chicago-style deep dish pizza after following the talk thread that Lindsey started and seeing all the comments.  I did a Yelp search, and found a few off in the far corners of the valley, but this had been a busy workday for me, and I just was not up to a long drive, even for a dinner craving I still haven't sated.  The evening was cool and perfect for a walk to a nearby restaurant, and still not having tried North, the wife and I decided to walk over and give it another shot.  She was glad we did.  We arrived shortly after happy-hour ended to a mostly-full restaurant and requested a table on the patio.  We were told it would be a 15-minute wait, which was just fine. ...  ... North is a very open, barn-like restaurant, with a high ceiling, lots of windows and a long bar that is broken by the wall, so you can sit inside or out.  The dining room is full of tables, but not crowded, with the open kitchen occupying one corner of this vast room.  The wife grabbed a chair outside the door to wait, as the bar was packed, and I wandered over to get a couple glasses of Merlot.  The pert and friendly bartender quickly poured my wine and took my money.  I wandered outside to join my wife in the people -watching at the valet stand.  Definitely seemed to be a hip, urban vibe going on here, as we enjoyed watching the traffic jam of bimmers, Mercedes and Porches all vying for valet service.  After a bit, one of the hostesses came over to us and said that they had a large-round table available on the patio, and we could sit there if we did not mind.  Of course we did not, so she guided us back to the well-lit patio and showed us to our table.  Where we waited.  And waited.  I made eye-contact with ever server -type person I could, yet we still waited.  After about 15 minutes of waiting and watching the busser clear tables, I spied an opening at the bar and suggested we move up there, having noticed other people dining there. This is where we met Kim. ...  ... Kim is a pretty, Italian woman working the bar, and she was just wiping down the two seats on the corner as we walked up.  She welcomed us with a big smile, then asked if we intended to dine (as we had our menus in hand).  We both said yes, and Kim said, "well, let's do it!"  Such a welcome relief- to finally have your presence acknowledged.  Kim quickly set us up with a bottle of tap water, and some silverware and asked for our order, the wife wanted some suggestions, asking about the diver scallops, Kim gushed about this was one of her favorite dishes.  That was enough to sway the wife.  Me, still wanting pizza, but tempted by the pasta, went with "the Pig", a pizza made with sopresalla (a dry salami), pepperoni, and house-made sausage.  Soon, an angry-looking woman - who by previous eye-contact would have been our server, delivered our dinner.  I hope the bar doesn't have to split tips, because she sure didn't deserve any of it.  ...  ... The Diver Scallops were three large, perfectly-seared scallops resting on a bed of mushroom risotto.  The wife devoured them, with lots of moans along the way.  I think she liked it.  My pizza was perfect - it almost killed my quench for chicago-style, although this was more New-York style, with a thin crust that was crispy/chewy on the edges and perfectly cooked through the center.  I scarfed the entire pizza, except for a tiny bit of crust that I grudgingly allowed my wife to have.   ...  ... After finishing our meal, Kim came back by to clean up and offered the dessert menu, again sharing her opinion of her favorites.  Clearly, she loved the donuts and with a confirmation from the guy drinking beer next to us, we went for it.  Four, meatball-sized crispy rounds filled with marscapone, rolled in cinnamon-sugar and resting in a puddle of Meyer lemon curd.   Delicious!  surprisingly light, not too sweet and a perfect ending to our meal. ...  ... Sitting at the bar was great, we talked with the bartenders, who were all personable, pretty and fun to talk with as they went about their business.  they all chatted with us, not ingoring us, even while continuing about their work.  It was a refreshing change from the cold-shoulder we got on the patio. ...  ... For a casual evening out, it's a bit pricey, coming in at just over $90 for two, but for the ambiance and the food, and especially for Kim, it was worth it, she saved the day for North Frattoria.  I'm not one to lecture anybody on service, but maybe just acknowledging the presence of a customer goes a long way.  Just sayin'. ...  ...  I highly recommend that when you go, sit at the bar and ask for Kim, you won't regret it.
21	5	0	0	0	The food is quite excellent as is the service. The decor is very clean and modern.
21	5	0	0	0	Fantastic food. Chef's board was great. I'd recommend one of their fancy cocktails with dinner. Our server Brian was hilarious. Only thing was you have to get there early'ish to get a prime seat.
21	5	0	0	0	Really good food and friendly bartenders.
21	3	0	1	0	3.5 stars if I could. Took a flier on North since the 7:30 Saturday night line at Chelsea's Kitchen was immense. We were able to get seated right away. Lovely place, especially on a cool November evening with everything opened up. Patio was nice, service was prompt & attentive and friendly. Wife was starving and they were able to quickly get our fried chickpeas out to us. Nice choice of craft beers. My tagliatelle bolognese was solid, but no more than that. Her Funghi pizza was, too. Best part of the meal -- donuts/profiteroles with lemon curd and mascarpone. Oh yes. All in all, good, but not great.
21	3	3	1	0	I really like this location of North.  They have great happy hour specials, the menu is diverse, you can order gluten free pasta, and the atmosphere is top notch.  I frequently suggest North when meeting friends because they are one of the few FOX restaurants that accept open table reservations.   ...  ... However, I am writing this post as a note the the ladies!  North is NOT heel friendly.  The driveway consists of gravel filled pavers which are a stilleto nightmare, and the floors inside are high polish hardwood which prove to be dangerous to the most modest of footwear.  I discovered this the hard way when walking from the rest room to the patio in 1 inch wedge shoes when I totally Tebow'd it in front of the bar.   ...  ... Shockingly, not a single employee of North came to check on my generally well being as I got up close and personal with the shiny waxed varnish, although two mildly inebriated wall street types did comment, 'Oh that floor is slippery!' as I brushed embedded crumbs off my knees.  Service is always good at North so I find it hard to believe no one witnessed me take the plunge as I returned to my table for cocktail hour.  ...  ... So.... North!  Perfect for low insurance deductible sneaker enthusiasts who love farmhouse inspired italian food.
21	2	0	0	0	I recently ate here with a group of friends and was underwhelmed.  I had a hard time choosing what I wanted to eat and finally settled on a bowl of pasta (Bucatini) with meatballs.  I thought the meatballs were overcooked and hard as rocks, the frozen turkey meatballs I microwave at home are better. Nice atmosphere and great, friendly service though.  Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing or maybe I don't like Northern Italian food.
21	5	0	0	0	Place is amazing.  Ambiance is great.  Employees are friendly as can be.  Food is terrific.  Get the plain pepperoni pizza. Tortallini is fantastic.  Cheese platter rocks.  Zuchini chips are outstanding.  You really can't go wrong here.  One of attorneys steve's favorite places in Phoenix.
21	4	1	1	1	Great place, Its loud, packed, EXPENSIVE FOR what you get and only has valet. But, I like and will return. Have only been twice, but since Gaspers burnt  or closed down, this is pry my fav  for Italian in central Phoenix.
21	4	0	1	0	Love this Fox restaurant. The space is beautiful, clean, sparkly,inviting. our waiter, Shane, was friendly, knowledgeable, efficient. Started with the arrancini balls for appy, very tasty fried crusty rice balls oozing cheese, nestled in red sauce. Husband had the P.E.I. Mussels in a luscious wine broth with salami nuggets and grilled bread for sopping. Superb. Entree for me was gnocchi with arugula and beef short ribs. Heaven. Other entree was dubbed "the pig" pizza. Fabulous crust with various pork sausages. I stole a piece from hub and have to say one of the best pizzas EVER. Dessert was a salted caramel pudding/mousse type concoction that was the bomb. Sweet touch of salt, creaminess. Sigh. As usual Fox does not disappoint. Great meal, service, surroundings. Not cheap but worth it. Molto bene.
21	2	0	1	0	My husband and I went here for dinner last night.  Similar to Chelsea's Kitchen this establishment is valet only. After dropping off our vehicle, we headed inside and although we didn't have a reservation,  we were seated fairly quickly as we opted to go ahead and be seated on the heated patio. We ordered the "bread & cheese" appetizer to start, which quite frankly, wasn't anything special and certainly wasn't worth the $11 price tag. My husband also ordered a Kilt Lifter (beer), which had a price tag of $5.50 and came out in a can. ...  ... For our entrees my husband ordered the ricotta gnocchi (with short ribs) while I ordered the bucatini with meatballs. When going to Italian restaurants, I have a tendency of ordering very basic dishes. I figure if a restaurant is able to nail the basics, then their other dishes are probably worth coming back for.  Sadly in this case, neither dish was particularly any good.  My husband's dish was on the salty side and lacked the luscious richness that one expects when ordering short ribs. My dish was bland and the meatballs that came with it (at an extra cost) were very small, (maybe an inch total in diameter) and completely dry. ...  ... Our tab came out to ~ $57 (before tip).  We typically wouldn't have minded paying this had the food been good, but sadly it was mediocre at best so we will not be returning.  ...  ... As we left the restaurant, the front end was very crowded.  We wondered why so many flocked to this restaurant for dinner and the conclusion that we came to was that perhaps they were coming here for the first time as well.  Hopefully their food was better than ours!
21	5	0	0	0	Great Food, Great Atmosphere! Check out this post about North! ...  ... http://stephangcalizona.wordpress.com/2012/10/13/north-fattoria-italiana/
21	4	0	1	0	Sunday's at North is always a relaxing experience. We started with the zucchini chips, perfectly sliced then and sprinkled with the right amount of sea salt. Truthfully my egg whites were over cooked, however the white polenta was fabulous and Mike's hamburger, although awkward looking with the focaccia bread, was also delicious.
21	2	0	0	0	I was extremely surprised and quite impressed to have received contact from a representative of North Fattoria nearly 2 weeks ago, in regards to my initial review.  Unfortunately, after responding back to the representative with my contact information, I never received another response back. Perhaps I shouldn't have put faith in their customer service after all.
21	4	0	0	0	Fantastic! And, great service! Went for Sunday brunch nice variety of menu selections for all people in your party! Nice open atmosphere.
21	5	0	0	0	First time here, will be coming back. Great atmosphere. I sat outside with my girlfriends and there were heating lamps which made it nice when it was cold. I noticed that the outside was pavement instead of sand (when I passed by before it used to be sand), which was nicer. You have to valet, it's complimentary - do not try to park across the street, they will tow you. I never experienced it, but I shop at the Fresh N Easy across the street and have seen cars get towed. I ordered a pasta dish and shared a cheese plate with my friends. The food was amazing and the service was great. If you go, you must also try the dessert, it's so much yummy-ness packed in a jar.
21	5	0	0	0	Awesome homemade pasta, we had 4 different types and they were all incredible! Our server, Shaun, was very personable and immensely knowledgeable about the menu. Will definitely go again! Oh and the salty carmel dessert was amazing!
21	3	0	0	0	It was lunch for four of us, and this is a pretty restaurant inside and out with valet parking. Damn, where'd my $1s go? ...  ... We drank iced teas and ate the grilled artichokes before their salads and my pizza arrived. Good artichoke with good fresh and tangy cheese on top and a rich lemony dipping sauce. I love artichokes and grilling them is a top-2 method of preparing them (frying in olive oil being the other). I wouldn't serve the inedible parts of an artichoke to my guests at home, however, and they left the woody parts on this one. *Poor bastard who never had an artichoke before still trying to chew the tough ass outer leaves on his... ...  ... Salads look bright and tasty with greens and cold cuts and served on a cutting board.  ...  ... My pizza is called "the Pig" and I thank them for naming this one after me. It had sausage, salami, and soppressata with mozzarella and tomato sauce and it was just what I wanted. Thin crust in the middle, thick at the edges and a little char on it. It was actually larger than I thought it would be so I had to take half of it home to enjoy it another day. ...  ... Service was attentive without being overly affectionate and as we were finishing our meal, we got to view some tortellini being hand made in the open kitchen. ...  ... Should I tip the valet again?
21	4	0	0	0	Zucca chips are great. Had two orders!! The service was a good however it took a long time to get our food. It was a Saturday night and packed.  Still a good time and great food. Had the spaghetti and meatballs.  Also tried the chicken parm, was very good. The pasta was great and the drinks were stiff.
21	3	0	0	0	its a good place but not mind blowing. great ambiance, solid menu, and great service. I will definitely go back.
21	3	0	0	0	Visited this place for lunch during the week.  I had the Spinach Tortellini my sister had the one of the salads but I cannot recall which one.  She did let me try it and it was pretty good.  My tortellini was very good but the servings are not very big.  Very open atmosphere, not too packed.  I would like to give it another go for dinner.
21	4	0	0	0	Went here 3 times in 2 weeks while in town on business! Great food and interesting atmosphere! Very trendy! Valet parking. If I'm back in town, will definitely stop by again!
21	5	0	0	0	Peg and I typically veer away (read run) when a restaurant is part of a chain. In spite of this being part of the Foxian empire, we were drawn to this place because of the wonderful Luis Millan,  His culinary chops are well documented and he could not have been a more gracious presence to our first visit here.The arancini and a chef's board of of sliced meats and cheese (with a wonderful apricot mostardo) began the meal and whetted the appetite. I had the heirloom beet salad and Peg the seasonal vegetable salad...the freshness permeated the dishes and the wonderful textural notes were wonderful. Moving to the mains, the chicken and prosciutto and spicy shrimp pasta dishes were wonderfully flavorful and not over spiced. A layered nutella, banana, dark chocolate, and hazelnut/plum combination  dessert was very satisfying. Our server was Kim.  The face of the house and the conduit to a wonderful experience is always the wait staff IMO...and she is superb. She is vigilant without hovering, and making sure all was well. I would strongly suggest that you try this place...but if your schedule permits...try the place as close to opening (4:00 pm) on a Saturday as you can make it.  We arrived at 4:30ish...and by 6 the place was almost booked. The atmosphere was wonderful, and in the relative quiet of the earlier hour..you can appreciate the commitment that this place has for its decor and customers.  Chain or no, individuals make the experience...and this experience was delightful.  Dr, B
21	4	0	0	0	Despite my aversion to eateries with "Fat" anywhere in the name, I found myself enjoying a (relatively) light dinner at North. ...  ... My mom and I split the handmade gigli with pesto, pine nuts and capers, which, up until I'd fished all the capers and pine nuts out, was pretty tasty. If you're new to the world of handmade pasta, this is a great place to start - not too intimidating in terms of flavors or textures. We also shared an eggplant pizza, which was not too cheese-y and delightfully flavorful. I'm not usually one to get hot 'n' bothered over eggplant, but I enjoyed this much more than I anticipated. ...  ... While we're discussing the concept of hot 'n' bothered: dessert. A shareable jar filled with a nutella budino, hazelnuts, a bit of crumbly goodness at the bottom, and topped with homemade dark chocolate shell, paired with lattes. Yes. Please. Thanks. ...  ... Another standard Fox Concepts hit - modern, clean, pretty, open, and probably featured somewhere in "Stuff White People Like."
21	4	0	0	0	So I am super conflicted about this place.  The service is excellent, you get free valet parking.  The decor is great, open kitchen, and just a great ambiance.  Then you have excellent tasting food. But my personal issue is that the food tastes are not my type of food, most of the foods have a more sour type taste like vinegar and lemon.  You can tell it's great food though.  I did not try the pizza but it looked really good.  I was just too full from everything else. ...  ... Here are the things I had (we had 17 people and they treated us really well). ...  ... Calamari - with lemons, but it's a lemon sauce not fried lemons like they seem to suggest, I didn't like it cuz of the lemons but it would have been great otherwise ...  ... Nutella Triffle - I normally don't do dessert but since it was my birthday I did.  This thing is great!  Three layers of chocolate, nutella and graham crackers. with hazel nuts on top. Yum! ...  ... Scallops and Risotto, well cooked scallops with a good risotto, a bit thinner than I prefer my risotto but I like it thicker than it normally comes. ...  ... Tortellini  with Spinach, this thing was really good, nice dense tortellini and greatly cooked spinach. ...  ... All in all, I'd come back and try the pizzas next time, but if you are into pasta with a zing of lemon, this place is great!
21	5	0	0	0	We stumbled upon this place by accident, and we sure are glad we did! This place never disappoints. The ambiance is unlike anything in Phoenix. It is fun to watch the cooks roll out fresh pasta and make ravioli. Fox Concepts has a great thing going on!
21	2	0	0	0	My girlfriend and I dined at this place tonight.  It wasn't bad, but there are dozens of better options for Italian food here locally.  Actually, there are numerous better options within a five mile radius.  Very lackluster, and the service wasn't even good.  I probably won't go back unless invited by someone else for a special occasion or something.
21	3	0	0	0	The patio is great.  They have a tasty house red.  The service was excellent. ...  ... That's the good... ...  ... I had the pesto pasta with chicken.  My girlfriend had the chicken parm.  It seems it would be difficult to strip flavor from Italian food but they managed it.  Both dishes were surprisingly, disappointingly bland.   ...  ... Other things we noticed - it's very loud inside, so if you want to talk without yelling hit the patio.  It also seems a little pricy for what you get. ...  ... In short, if you're looking for some good Italian with a neighborhood feel do yourself a favor and make the short drive west to Giuseppe's (28th and Indian School.)
21	1	0	0	0	I had the Bucatini with meat balls and I have to say it was far less than par. I understand they make their own pasta, but the meat balls didn't seem like they were made in house, Why... well if you cook then you know you wouldnt include an artery in your meat balls would you? Yeah it completely ruined my appetite pulling an artery out of my half chewed mouthful of meat. Gross to say the least. I was hoping this place would be my new lunch spot however I wont be going back ever. The potatoes were amazing and the drinks were meh okay... I was surprised at the price of the food. Truly not worth what I paid...
21	5	5	8	8	All day Happy Hour on Sunday! ... I just moved within walking distance of North and I could not be happier.  ... I have been a couple times now and love it! ... Their house wine is great and during HH even their reserve bottles of wine are half off! The chef's board is very good and filled with very thin sliced Genoa salami and a spicy version. It also comes with two cheeses, a golden raisin compote, spiced nuts, bread and the best damn green olives I can remember eating. Seriously, these olives are great, order a side of them. Trust me. ... They have a daily special pizza ($8 during Happy Hour). The pizza is thin and crispy without any char, which I like. The crust is big and fluffy with a sprinkle of course salt. It actually reminds me of a delicious soft pretzel...crazy huh? ... On to the mains...I ordered the house-made spinach tortellini. WOW! It is not a huge portion but plenty to feel satisfied without ending up in a food coma. The cheese filling is so light and buttery. You must check out this simple dish. I was also lucky enough to taste the scallops. I am a huge scallop fan and I am quite picky about them. These are the best I have had in a very long time. Perfectly cooked over a mushroom risotto. OMG! ... Go here and get some great food and a glass (or bottle) of wine, but don't take my seat.  ...  ... PS. They allow dogs on the patio!
21	4	1	7	5	Having enjoyed the North in Kierland Commons, this location had much to live up to. To start, we ordered the highly addicting zucca chips and two glasses of white wine. We were sold on trying the handmade pasta so I got the spicy shrimp and my girlfriend tried the lasagna. The shrimp had a nice kick and I really enjoyed the pasta texture and sauce. You can tell they put an emphasis on quality ingredients. For dessert, we had the sugary doughnuts served on a custard sauce which were ok, though not quite as good as I remembered. The restaurant is open and lively, much like many of the other Sam Fox concepts. For a good meal and a terrific ambiance, you can't go wrong with checking out this "Italian Farmhouse." ...  ... FYI - Come prepared to valet your car because the parking lot is packed on a busy night.
21	3	0	0	0	Hipster atmosphere and plenty of house made options. Definitely better than your typical Italian restaurant but not the best. Very noisy and hard to park.
21	5	0	0	0	I've been to North multiple times and it is at the top of my list.  Especially to take family and friends to because they always are consistently good... for service... ambience... and of course delicious food and drink. ...  ... They have a super tasty tequila drink that I recommend... and the pesto pasta dish with chicken is my absolute fave!
21	3	0	0	0	The food is here is decent, but the portion size for the price just doesn't seem to be a good value. Service always seems to be rushed, and the clientele is loud and more on the Scottsdale side, even though it's located in Arcadia. There are other Italian options that are better in the area such as Italian Restaurant and Guiseppes.
21	3	0	0	0	I have eaten here many times and the food and service has been exceptional. I am going to assume that today was a fluke. I will continue to frequent North because the good far outweighs the bad of today. My advice is don't order the omelette with prociutto, unless you are craving airline quality food. The taste and texture reminded me exactly of the omelettes I have had when flying. Instead, opt for the white polenta and eggs, or the fried eggs in red sauce with Italian sausage. And the Red Rooster (bloody Mary) is outstanding. Please, North, take the omelette off the menu and you will be batting 1000.
21	5	0	1	0	Our first trip to North and we couldn't have been more pleased. The service was excellent and the food was unbelievable. ... We will definitely return to this place again
21	2	0	0	0	Had an early dinner at North tonite, party of 7.  We got there before the dinner rush, so plenty of open seating in the restaurant.  Despite that, the service was slow and somewhat inattentive.  I've eaten at many Fox restaurants and this is the first one that really disappointed me from a service standpoint.  Once the food arrived, it was great.  But we waited much too long and wondered if we were invisible.  I'll give it another try, but with built in skepticism.
21	4	0	1	0	Came here because I had gone to the other North (in Kierland) just a few days prior and had such a good meal that I had to return.  The mushroom pizza ("funghi" to be exact) which was AH-mazing at the other location, but here it was a little dry... not as much cheesy mushroom-y goodness.  Was a little disappointed needless to say since I had been craving that pizza from the moment I licked the plate clean at Kierland.  ...  ... The service was terrific though, we sat at the bar (wish I remembered the bartender's name). Drinks were good & strong and the ambiance was great, so I would still come to this one if in the area, but I'll make the extra drive to the more "north" North for my funghi fix.
21	4	0	0	0	This is a very important 4 stars. My wife and I had a major incident while we were there, and I have complete justification to write a bad review. However, the management staff recognized the major impact of the issue, took care of everything quickly, for the 4 star recovery. On to the food... ... I always respect an Italian restaurant that gives aranchinis a try. These were very good for an American restaurant. Still on the look out for an authentic style one... ... The entire menu seems like a scientific slight american modification of traditional Italian dishes. They were well prepared, but left me wanting the real thing. We will return, for the quality of the food was exceptional.
21	4	0	1	0	Update: ...  ... So, I've been back to North, and am happy to say that I've met two additional cool people who are running the bar. Yay! Really great service.  ... North also has an excellent management team who is obviously dedicated to their business, and I'm looking forward to putting this place back into my rotation. :-) Very cool.
21	4	1	0	0	Wet, moist and damp. The patio offered almost an African Rain Forrest feel but the pasta and salad delivered. Great food.
21	4	0	0	0	This is my favorite of the Sam Fax concepts.  North has been revamped and is now more rustic.  It's a huge, huge improvement over the old North.  I have been to the Kierland, 40th Street and Tucson locations.   ...  ... The Good:  We love the location on 40th Street.  We usually go on a Sunday afternoon for a late lunch.  We like to sit at the bar and the bar tenders are all super friendly.  We also like the wine special, don't know what that says about us.  There are so many good choices on the menu.  The pasta is all handmade.  The pizza's are excellent and they have a good selection of wines.  The Tucson location is beautiful and there is a great view from the patio. ...  ... The Bad:  For some reason some of my favorite items from the menu are not available at the Kierland location.  Also, the lasagne is not very good, I would avoid it.
21	5	0	0	0	Yummy yummy yummy!!! Amazing home made pasta! We ordered 4 different pasta dishes and lovvveed everyone - we will definitely be back! The meat and cheese app to start was also great!
21	5	0	0	0	This place is one of my favorites. It's gorgeous inside. Staff is great. The food is excellent and their Sunday "happy hour" menu is absolutely great for a late morning brunch.
21	5	0	1	1	Outstanding.  Food/service/price all top drawer.  We had come from Central Bistro where we were driven out by the noise.  Had a double great meal... ... Avoid the noise and go here. ... LJK
21	4	2	2	2	Absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE their ALL-DAY happy hour every Sunday! The bucatini and meatballs at $5 is an absolute STEAL - I highly recommend doing a double order and calling it dinner! The noodles are homemade and delectably thick and chewy, the red sauce is fresh, and the small meatballs are moist and delicious!  ...  ... We started tonight with the grilled artichoke, which was extremely tasty but highly overpriced at $12 for a single small/medium sized artichoke. We also ordered the arancini, which was oozing with cheesy goodness and comes three to an order. During happy hour, the arancini is $5 an order, which is totally reasonable for the size of the app; regular price is about double. I ordered the braised short rib and ricotta gnocchi, which was beautifully presented and nicely cooked, but it was bland and lacked seasoning. The bombolini dessert was a lovely end to a great meal - four cinnamon sugar covered "beignets" on a bed of real vanilla mascarpone and Meyer lemon curd.  ...  ... The service was amazing and the food was great! The only downfalls were the intense number of flying insects invading our table space and the co-ed bathrooms. I'm all for social progress but there's a good reason men and women have maintained separate bathrooms throughout history, and it has nothing to do with gender segregation. It's just that guys always pee all over the toilet seats...  ...  ... Overall, it was another great dining experience, brought to you courtesy of Fox Restaurant Concepts, and we will definitely be taking advantage of this happy hour again in the near future!
21	4	0	1	1	New american style italian.  I enjoyed everything I had and the fact they had some real italian dishes mixed in w/ some italian with a new american twist or ingredients. Something for everyone here.  Espresso here is tasty as well and if your going to put italian in your name that is a must.  I don't recall what brand it is, I believe it is local not lavazza or illy. However I like that about the Fox chains. They are all dependably tasty, fresh and local inspired.
21	3	0	0	0	The three would be a five if I was commenting only on the excellent food.  The wine selections are not good and are extremely overpriced.  They have this whole do you want 6oz vs. 8oz of wine scam going on?  You end up paying a premium price for average wine served in highball rustic glasses.  Ambiance is great but someone needs to come in and totally revamp the wine situation there.
21	5	0	0	0	I'm not a big fan of the Fox Concepts restaurants, but his new venture at 40th St/Camelback is wonderful! It is billed as having a rustic, farmhouse atmosphere - I guess that explains the blue jeans and plaid, western-style shirts on the servers (really?? Isn't that better suited to a rustic, western atmosphere??) That said, the place does have a certain lively vibe and energetic atmosphere. They offer both inside and patio seating, although neither outside area offers a particularly nice view - either the parking lot or 40th Street and the shopping area across the street. But when the weather's nice, it's always a treat to eat outside. ...  ... We started with the bruschetta which was very, very good - a sign of more goodness to come! Our entrees included: spinach tortelloni, spicy shrimp and the pig pizza. The homemade spinach pasta was delicious and stuffed with mouth-watering cheese in a herb butter sauce. I could've done with about half the butter only because I'm not a butter fan, but must admit it was very flavorful. We were a little apprehensive that the shaved fennel on the spicy shrimp would be overpowering, but it wasn't at all. The dish was beautifully presented over homemade pasta and was very flavorful - worth ordering again! The pig pizza - so called because of its 4 pork meats - was good, too. The crust baked to perfection (no nasty burn areas). ...  ... Our service was fine - attentive, friendly and not hovering. This restaurant is in a great location and the complementary valet is a plus since the parking area is limited. ...  ... Definitely returning - sounds like a Sunday Happy Hour is in my future!
21	3	0	0	0	Cool fireplace on the patio. Very open feel inside. Small portions on the pasta for what you pay. Donuts for dessert...deelish.
21	5	2	2	1	Another great offering from Fox Concept Restaurants. Bravo. ...  ... The building looks like a giant barn, and the interior resembles a barn as well. But don't be fooled; this restaurant is CLEAN as a whistle and the lighting is spot on. The servers and bartenders are dressed in jeans and other farm attire so they do look a little goofy, but it works. It just works. The bartenders actually care about you enjoying your experience. They're not there to puff up their chests and flex for the girls. These guys know customer service and they are spectacular. ...  ... The food?! Heavenly. The arancini was perfect and the sauce divine. But the real treat was the main course: I tried the Bolognese, which is something I have perfected (in my opinion!) at home. I'm very picky. Luckly, they did not disappoint. The bolognese was very moreish and I could not stop eating. I left a very happy man. Kudos to the guys scurrying around in the open-air kitchen! ...  ... And now for my one (and only) bitch about this restaurant: and I nearly took away a star because of it. JUST as the sun was setting, the bartenders took it upon themselves to open all the window-doors surrounding the bar. It's nice, but only when it's 79 degrees outside! And the sun...burst forth and blinded me along with anyone else sitting westward. All the nice cool air just slipped out the restaurant and it became quite uncomfortable. ...  ... Yes, I know it's Friday night and you want the restaurant to seem as open as possible...but it's already A BARN! You do not need to open all the windows in the middle of summer...and especially when the sun is still able and willing to stun and piss off your diners.  ...  ... This restaurant, despite the only one flaw, is a masterpiece. (And guys, STOP going out in public wearing flip flops or sandals. You all look ridiculous.) I step off my soapbox.

They have a great selection of wines here and I can comfortably recommend anything on their menu.  The bruschetta is always my starter.   ...  ... This location looks very different from their fancier look but the italian country decor is not bad. They changed the menu from my last visit but the selections are still very good.  I ordered the chicken sandwich with apricot jelly and loved it.
21	4	0	0	0	Like other reviewers, the consistency of tasty food (esp the home made pasta!) keeps us coming back.
21	4	1	3	1	Worthy of 4.5 stars.  I initially had attitude about going to a restaurant that is part of a group (Fox Concepts) but that was judging a book from the cover.  ...  ... I love the restaurants on 40th street, several of good ones on that street (Chelsea's Kitchen, The Vig, La Grande Orange, this one).   ...  ... We went there on a Sunday and it was packed.  Great vibe in the place.  Good decor - it is like a warehouse, open kitchen, etc. ...  ... Great happy hour prices and happy hour is all day on Sundays!! ...  ... Excellent bucatini with meatballs (homemade pasta) ... Castrevallano olives - delicious Italian ( not too briny)  ... Charcuterie & cheese plate with crusty fresh bread - very good ... Bottles of wine - half price during happy hour. ...  ... Service was outstanding.  We sat at the bar and the bartenders were attentive and continued to refill water glasses. ...  ... Definitely worth a visit!
21	4	0	0	0	Just went here today for the first time.  Nice, clean, well lit, spacious dining experience.  Bloody Mary was good, and the pesto pasta was tasty and very fresh.  Also, nice clean personal restrooms, with nice scented soap!  Thanks!
21	4	0	0	0	I tend to be a bit picky about Italian food, because about 4 generations ago, my family was 100% Italian.  That being said, I am still impressed with this place's food.  It was certain good, but everything had a pro/con dichotomy (I'm just trying that word out for a bit). ...  ... Case in point:  Food was good, but it was an unusual pricing menu.  My partner got a margherita pizza, allegedly made from scratch, for a few dollars less than my spaghetti (no meatballs).  I couldn't understand why spaghetti cost more than making a pizza - a bit odd to me. ...  ... Point #2:  The atmosphere was really upbeat and fun, but we sweated like crazy.  The "farmhouse" atmosphere felt like just that - a farmhouse.  We were told they're trying the best they can, but it wasn't helping too much.  We were sweating during parts of the meal. ...  ... Overall, I think I would come back.  Since I recently gave up eating red meat, I think the spaghetti, although kind of pricey, is a force to be reckoned with.  I would just enjoy it more in a better climate-controlled environment.
21	5	0	0	0	Their food is authentico italiano. I loved the arancini to start and my tortellini was homemade and unbelievably excellent. I will come back during happy hour for their deal that includes a bottle of wine. Fox Restaurants are always a high standard.
21	5	0	1	0	Went here on Saturday night for a date night with my boyfriend. Both of us had never been here before and we were craving some Italian food.  I had seen on the menu they make their pasta in house and the reviews looked good so we decided to try it. I am so happy we did! I had the bolognese pasta and he had the spaghetti and meatballs they were both excellent dishes. For desert we had some salted carmel thing I cant remember the name but it was delicious!!! We will definitely be returning. The service was great too!!!
21	4	31	39	37	HAPPY HOUR REVIEW: ...  ... Warning! Going to Sam Fox Restaurants for Happy Hour after a movie can be habit forming.  ...  ... We have heard many good things about this Italian farmhouse concept, but we were little hesitant given that we found the lunch at North in Kierland just okay.  Our caution however, was unwarranted. ...  ... AMBIANCE/MOOD: ... We arrived around four-thirty and the parking lot was mostly empty. Were they open we thought? But as we approached the front door, it was opened by a hostess and we were invited in. Nice.   ...  ... We said we had come for the Happy Hour and were escorted not to the bar, but to some tables along the back wall. We were given menus, both Dinner and HH and heard a brief explanation of the fish special. Very cozy and very nice. I have taken a few photos of the inside of the restaurant.  The mood is upscale and dare I say 'hip". ...  ... MENU: ... Like other Fox places, the HH menu is more of a starting point of samplers. For instances, if you like HH serving of freshly made meatballs and spaghetti, then maybe you'll like the lager dinner serving. ...  ... The HH menu has about a dozen items, mostly in the $5.00 - $8.00 range.  They have Caesar Salad, Arancini, Pizza of the Day $8, Chef's Board of meats and cheese $10, Zucca chips $3.  Two holdovers from other restaurants are the Castelvetrano Olives $3 and Spiced Nuts $2. These two look similar to the Olive & Ivy's offering. http://www.yelp.com/biz/olive-and-ivy-scottsdale#hrid:XB-E39WNviGs1MkkQ4XIxw ...  ... As you would expect, they also have all beers and well drinks priced at $4.00 to $5.00.  But what we found special, are all their wines marked at 50% off.  They will also re-cork it for you to go. ...  ... Here are links to the menus: ... http://www.foxrc.com/frcwp/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/North_40th_Menu_Happy_Hour.pdf ... http://www.foxrc.com/frcwp/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/North_40th_Dinner_Menu2.pdf ...  ... SERVICE: ... We found the service to be very professional.  Yes, the water glasses were refilled on a timely basis, but also the wait staff comes by and chats with you about your food and answers any questions you have very knowledgeably.  We actually got into a very detailed discussion on Washington State wines and Oregon Pinots with our server Vail. ...  ... FOOD: ... We started off by ordering a Washington State Chardonnay, but found they didn't have any chilled.  We then opted instead for the Snoqualmie Riesling, which was somewhat sweet, with a hint of cherries. ...  ... We tried the HH Caesar Salad for $5.00 and the HH Spaghetti, also for $5.00. The salad came with some of the most delicious croutons that had a smokey taste we have ever had.  A definite must.  The spaghetti was equally interesting and flavorful.  The meatballs must be cooked in a marinara, and has a complexed layering taste which was different than the pasta sauce, which has a hint of fennel. Wow. ...  ... Next we ordered the Margherita Pizza ($11.00) off the Dinner menu, see photos. It was very good but we found the cheese slipped off when you bit into a wedge.  ...  ... For dessert, we each ordered the Gelato scoop for $3.00 and the Tiramisu for $6.00, both off the dinner menu.  I've taken pictures of the Titamisu.  It came in a glass ramekin with an amazing amount of delicious mascarpone cheese and flavorful Kahlua. ...  ... PRICES: ... Our petite Happy Hour dinner of six items, ran us $41.50 before taxes and gratuities.  It also included the bottle ($23.00, 50% off) of Riesling, which our wonderful server Vail re-corked for us. As we left, the parking lot was full with a dozen cars waiting to be parked. ...  ... Enjoy!

21	4	0	0	0	I love Fox Concepts....this was no exception! Customer service was on point, delicious food...three words "braised...short rib...gnocchi.." - that really says it all!
21	5	0	0	0	this restuaurant is authentic italian food! our area is full of "chain" restuarants that land you waiting for an hour and rushed out in just the same amount of time stuffed full of the usual fair! here, you get a great meal, great ambiance, and service that is tops! thanks to the great staff and owner this restaurant is tops in the area for italian. i guarantee you will go home with food, they sreve you so much! if you need a date night out, eat here and head over to amc or dave and busters at the mall. the other posters were right, parking is tight, but worth it! i'm glad i found this place.
21	4	0	0	0	I would just like to say that the staff at Arcadia North are amazing, as is the Chef!   ...  ... We attended their most recent community dinner and let's just say that the participating guests were NOT very friendly to us, with several guests telling us that open seats were taken by their friends who had yet to arrive.  This was so off putting since it was a COMMUNITY DINNER and frankly it was hurtful as well.  Long story short, we ended up being seated at a 4 top away from the community dinner table and we were just about we ready to leave. ...  ... If it hadn't been for the staff and I mean all of the staff we would have left and I would be writing a very different review.  They were very apologetic, professional, attentive and kind.  In the end we were so glad that we stayed because the menu courses and wine pairings were superb.  The Summer Corn Agnolotti was sublime.  The grilled lamb was cooked to perfection and each wine pairing was absolutely perfect.  Our waiter, who hailed from my "neck of the woods" in the East Bay California, was so well informed about the wines and such an excellent waiter.  I feel that the food was as good as I've had in many 4 star San Fransisco restaurants, which is saying a lot for Phoenix. ...  ... We may not attend another community dinner, at least not in Arcadia but we will return to North.  I commend everyone who helps to makes North an excellent dining experience!
21	4	0	0	0	Nice place nice customer service I didn't like the lasagna it was to liquid but our waiters Kathy was so nice and she bring me the menu again so I choose a salad it's was ok but the Sangria I drink was so so good I think I made me dizzy so excuse my worlds lol, oh she also give us a dessert I got the salty something and it was so good I will come back again
21	5	3	3	4	(Lyrics - Tears for Fears - Everybody Wants to Rule the World) ...  ... Welcome to North Fattoria ... There's no turning back ... Even while we eat ... We will find you at the bar for Happy Hour ... Buy a drink and some bruschetta ... Everyone should try North Fattoria ...  ... It's my own decision ... It's my own review ... Help you to decide ... Help you make the most ... Of eating and of pleasure ... Nothing ever taste this good ... Everyone should try North Fattoria ...  ... North Fattoria Italiana, almost a mouth full trying to say it.  Either that or I'm busy stuffing my face!  NFI is a Sam Fox Restaurant so you know the ambience is awesome!  I've never felt out of place every time I go to any of his restaurants.  NFI is laid out like an old Italian kitchen.  Like mama's home cooked meal I say!  Lots of vintage lighting and an open patio.  I believe the garage doors open during the cooler months for a fresh breeze to run through the restaurant -- mmm nice!   ...  ... I came to NFI several times and their HH is very good.  Wine and dine at the bar with some flatbreads cause it's my favorite.  I ordered "The Pig"  and it was a bunch of pork, but man you know; that's what I like!  No skimping the protein here!  Nice warm and cheese crust, while can add some crushed pepper to give it some kick!  Perfect with "ma ber"!  Their pasta is good too so don't for get to leave some room before you come.  I ordered their regular spaghetti and meatballs and lets just say it's my favorite in town!  The sauce taste like it's made from scratch while the meatballs, well meatballs to me are meatballs, but the sauce is what really makes a pasta dish.  In the end, I was delighted with my meals and the atmosphere was perfect to just relax and enjoy a few drinks before departing. - Enjoy
21	5	0	0	1	YUM. We have come here before for the wine and desert so we had to do dinner. ...  ... The first time I came for dinner I had the braised beef gnocci and boyfriend had the pork tenderloin. Both awesome. Desert was the doughnuts and the carmel...thing...it was like a custard and I forget what its called but it was amazing. ...  ... Next time we brought mom and dad. We came around the end of happy hour so were able to get the butchers board app and a bottle of wine for the happy hour pricing. I love how thin the meat is sliced and it was delicious. And cheese is awesome no matter what way you cut it. ...  ... Mom got my suggested braised beef and dad got the pesto -which was all of our favorites. I got the lasagna and boyfriend had the scallops with mushroom risotto. All to die for. The pasta is so fresh and delicious and all of their flavors are amazing.I love it there. Dad was really impressed with the decor and ambiance and of course that's why we love it as well. ...  ... Dad loves tiramisu so we got that. It was awesome and a great way to end the night.  ...  ... We love coming here whether its to share some wine and a dessert or cheese board or to come and fatten up for the night. And we will always come back for more.
21	4	0	0	0	Went here yesterday for a work lunch with a group of 7. They were great about accommodating us and our table was perfect. I've been to the North in Kierland commons and this one definitely outdoes that location. The seating is gorgeous - very open and airy and I love the natural light. Seems like a cute spot for a date night or a girls dinner and drinks night. Their patio looks super cute but with it being deathly hot in Phoenix right now I'll have to wait to try it.  ...  ... I ordered a chicken caesar salad which was good for a plain salad - I wasn't expecting much and was trying to stick to my healthy eating plan. My coworker ordered a pizza that I have literally been dreaming about ever since. It looked amazing - its currently on my must try list. Dessert was very good - ordered the salted caramel budino which was amazeballs - totally worth the extra time at the gym. Will definitely be returning when I can indulge a little bit more.
21	3	1	3	2	Interesting thing happened here. I'll start off by saying that I've wanted to try North for a while so shout out to Monica for making me get my butt in here. I also have to throw in that we both look absolutely smashing in purple. ...  ... So let's start with the good. North, like any Fox restaurant manages to pull off a fun, casual, lively atmosphere that is good for groups or a smaller crowd that likes to have fun. In keeping with the Italian Farmhouse motif, the inside has an open, almost converted barnyard feel with accents and decor that convey that farm fresh atmosphere. ...  ... You can count on a few modern twists to traditional Italian dishes from their appetizers and mains to their desserts. I appreciated having a choice of Peroni or Moretti. Their cocktail menu was interesting however the feedback from others was "not impressed" so I'm glad I stuck with a Moretti. ...  ... I started with a very respectable Caesar Salad. I am becoming more and more picky about my Caesars so theirs was as I said, respectable but not stellar. Our friendly server recommended the bolognese over the lasagna so I went with her confident recommendation.   ...  ... Now this is my problem, not the restaurant's but I am one of those weirdos that likes capellini as my pasta of choice. I know, after nearly getting into an argument with a server at another restaurant (not a Fox restaurant), that a larger noodle renders more of the flavor of the sauce. This is why a bolognese is typically accompanied by linguini...fair enough. What I don't understand is this seemingly new trend where bolognese is now served with fettucini.  ...  ... Long story short, this is how my bolognese was served and while it was good it didn't send me into endorphin-laden bliss like when I have some smooth-as-velvet capellini with my hearty bolognese. So it was good, not great and truth be told a bit of a let down. I know for the future to ask for capellini, so this is not the restaurant's fault.  ...  ... What did blow me out of the water was their grilled asparagus. I am so glad I ordered this side. The asparagus was decent sized and grilled up perfectly. I knew I was going to regret it in the bathroom later on eating this much asparagus but it was so damned good. I can't believe I hated this stuff when I was a kid. ...  ... I took part of my dinner home to save room for dessert, which was vanilla gelato with expresso. Again, good but not stellar. But it's OK because we went to LGO for second dessert (like a good hobbit, I skipped elevensies) ...  ... So here is the interesting part. When I heated up my leftovers the next day for lunch, it was DELICIOUS!!!! Fettucini or no fettucini it was AWESOME. How often is your food better on the second day? ...  ... So to sum up, the best part of my meal was the company. North is definitely a fun place to go, but I would go more for the atmosphere less for the food and I don't think I'd go out of my way to come back here. But if I were invited for more food and fun, far be it for me to decline.
21	4	2	4	4	Met up with some fellow yelpers on a Wednesday night for the International Supper Club UYE, this time we headed off to North Fattoria Italiana . ...  ... I have to say I have driven by many times and thought, wow I love the look of this place, the huge windows are so inviting! So when this place was picked I was pretty excited!  I got there a little bit early which was ok; it allowed me to really take this place in.  I absolutely love the opened kitchen. The entire place has this opened feel to it, rustic yet modern at the same time.  Visually impressive. ...  ... Some of us meet up for Happy Hour, but quickly found out that happy hour ended at 6, so I rushed my order in at 8 mins till. I had a glass of the house white wine, it was very pleasant!   ...  ... After everyone arrived it was time to order! I surveyed the menu over and over, but kept going back to the Pesto dish. I love Pesto! It's one of my favorite dishes, also something that isn't cooked often in my house, so I took this opportunity and ordered it. The pesto was fresh, the noodles perfectly cooked and fresh! Love homemade noodles! I was very pleased with my meal!  Everyone's dishes looked amazing too! ...  ... Glad to have tried North Fattoria Italiana and look forward to coming back!
21	2	0	3	2	Sorry, Monica and Ursula but I don't think this was the best pick for the ISC dinner. The food was just ok and I wouldn't say it was particularly authentic Italian. I ordered the Fungi pizza and even though I was expecting exotic mushrooms and caramelized onions what is actually on the pizza is lightly sauted button mushrooms and white onions. So, pretty much the same as you get at Pizza Hut or Papa Johns. And the smoked mozzarella had a very artificial taste to it, as if it was not actually smoked but had liquid smoke or some other chemical added to it to make it taste smoky. ...  ... Don't get me wrong, I still ate half the pizza that night and took the other half home. It wasn't terrible, just not as good as I was hoping. I probably would have given North a solid three stars if it wasn't for the fact that I also ordered a glass of pinot noir for $20. It was a large pour, but that is still probably more than I have ever paid for a glass of wine in a restaurant, including very high end places. I looked it up online and Fox Restaurants partnered with a winery in Oregon to bottle this wine specifically for their restaurants. So I am really confused as to why it was priced so high? Its the most expensive on the list (I didn't know that when I ordered it). Since it was commissioned by Fox it is not available in regular retail channels so I can't compare prices, I just know it was not worth $20 a glass. Its flavor lacked complexity and the wine had very little body to it... it almost tasted watered down (**not accusing anybody of anything, just saying that's what it tasted like**). It was very disappointing. ...  ... I liked the casual and open atmosphere of the place and probably would be a fan if I had enjoyed the food and drink more. For me, North falls into the category of "not worth the money". Unfortunately, I don't think I will return.
21	5	1	1	2	This place is AH-MAZING!!! Can't wait to go back. ...  ... We went here for our 3rd anniversary dinner and I'm very glad we did.  ...  ... SERVICE-Our waitress was VERY knowledgeable about the menu. She was great at first but when it got busy she completely forgot about us. By the end she seemed more interested in doing roll-ups to get out early rather than paying attention to her tables. ...  ... FOOD-  ... Appetizer: we had the grilled artichoke. The flavor was spot on--BUT it was WAY over cooked.  ... Entrees: We ordered the Gnocchi w/ Braised Beef in a light Horseradish Cream Sauce, it was FANTASTIC!! I could have licked the bowl it was so damn good--but I was in public. We also ordered the pizza w/ egg, potato, and bacon on it. It was like breakfast on a pizza and man that was a great breakfast pizza. We will definitely be going back just for the pizza. ... Dessert- Lemon Donuts. OMG so good. ...  ... GO HERE IF YOUR EVEN DEBATING IT! I'll be back for sure.
21	5	0	1	0	I've officially been to North once, but unofficially twice. The first was through trying brunch leftovers my husband brought home (The Pig pizza and Short rib gnocchi) and the 2nd I had to try for myself first hand. So first thing, parking lot is small. We happened to have reservations as they were opening, so it wasn't a problem. They have complimentary valet, kinda weird for such a small lot. But helpful. Interior is clean farmhouse rustic. I loved the family style table we were seated at, wish I could've taken that table home with us. Definitely great for groups, great for babies/kids. There is also a beautiful bar area, if its just a party of one or two. Now, for the food, that's really what u go for right? Ambiance is great and all, but what about the food? Top to bottom delicious, creative and executed to perfection. ...  ... Brunch Cocktail, first on the menu, The Red Rooster. An italian spin on a brunch favorite. Bloody mary with freshly crumbled parmesan mixed throughout and decorated with caprese. Caprese? Yes, one leaf of basil, tomato, and mozzarella. It sucks that I've never come up with this combination on my own. Bloody mary = tomato, italian = tomato, cheese, basil. Simple, creative, delicious. I would definitely get this again OR dare even try it at home. ...  ... Our chosen appetizers - zucca chips, bread board and custard filled donuts... is that a lot for appetizers, well yes, but that's not the point. Friends highly recommended the zucca chips, which I was more than willing to try even though I had no idea what they were. As it turns out, it isn't some exotic delicacy. Just fried zucchini. I don't say that lightly though because these were not the TGIFridays chunky cut, breaded, and fried zucchini. Zucca chips, were exactly that, chip-style - thinly sliced, slightly crispy, lightly salted, mini-zucchini goodness. Bread board has house-made rustic bread. Light, soft, airy on the inside with an crunchy outer crust. The usual thinly sliced charcuterie, cheese, olives, spiced mixed nuts, and a sweet chutney. Again, simple - but done well. Now, the unexpected we're the custard filled donuts. The very first menu item is pastries, choice of cinnamon rolls or custard filled donuts. We went with donuts. An order comes with 3, we got 2 orders. And they were nice enough to accommodate us with +1 for our party of 7. The donuts were unexpected because one, they are kinda hidden in the menu, and two - this place just screams savory - not sweet, but these little donuts (donut holes), crispy fried dough, dusted with powdered sugar, moist inside with a creamy lemon custard. That custard was so good, we were scraping it from the plate after having devoured our little tasty donut ball. ...  ... I was impressed with the short rib gnocchi i tasted from leftovers last week. Following that theme, I selected the short rib hash for my entree. I was not disappointed. Usually, my gripe,with hash - is the hash part. Usually too much potato. Not here. Perfect amount of short rib to potato. The hash was soft potato cubes with red peppers and onions. The short rib, moist and fall apart tender. All topped with poached egg. The egg yolk was soft but not runny. I would've preferred a runny egg, but did not affect overall taste. Buttered Toasted bread served on the side was so good. Toasted bread? Really - so good. One side was purposely burnt and it just worked. ...  ... It's a 45 minute drive, but will definitely come back -  gotta try more of the menu. Thanks to our friends for introducing us to North Fattoria Italiana. I don't even know what Frattoria means, but doesn't really matter. It is just good.
21	4	0	0	0	I went here for my birthday with my parents. Enjoyed the atmosphere which is always important for me and the food was good but not amazing. I don't mind it being real or authentic Italian as long as the flavors and portions are good. I rarely get an appetizer but for my birthday decided why not. Chose the bruschetta with crescenza cheese, prosciutto, truffle oil and asparagus. It was tasty but I guess I was expecting something similar to what one usually gets at Postinos with several varieties. It was tasty but it they served only one large bruschetta to share. Nothing wrong with that but just different than my expectations.  ...  ... I found my dish, the spinach tortelloni, a little on the small side portion wise but otherwise very tasty. I tasted my parents dish (my dad got the spicy shrimp pasta dish, a generous portion and what one should expect at $18, mom ordered the burrata salad (which my dad had heard was also on the small side but with the added portion of salmon, a large piece) it was balanced out (however it was $20 for that, quite an expensive salad for what she received).  ...  ... Wine as good (I ordered a Zinfandel) and the dessert I chose, Nutella trifle was on the house and also very good.  ...  ... I'd like to come again and see if there are any changes to the menu and/or quality of food but it's reputation is definitely earned and I think it's a great place to grab some drinks and maybe a bite if you're trying to do happy hour.
21	3	0	1	0	My husband and I dined here on Saturday 9/7 to celebrate his birthday.  We are big fans of North Kierland (we had our 1st date & got engaged here :)) so we decided to try the Arcadia location.  It was great!  The atmosphere was extremely loud as there was a 40th birthday celebration with a group of 15 seated in the center of the restaurant, which made our dinner conversation a lot louder than it should have been. ... The staff was amazing quick friendly service.  We had the mussels to start and they were delicious!  The dish was served with 2 pieces of bread, which was not enough for the large bowl of broth and we were charged for the additional bread which was disappointing but well worth it.  ... For our entrees I had the seared scallops with mushroom risotto and at the reccommendation of our server he had the short ribs.  My dish was outstanding and we ending up sharing that as his was just average.  The ribs came with gnocchi which was good except there was very little meat.  My dish had 3 medium sized scallops they were cooked perfectly, but for the price I don't think I'd order again.  ... Overall the food was good, the atmosphere was far too loud to be considered kid friendly, and the price for the quantity was extremely over priced.
21	4	1	3	1	It was my mom's and my first time here. The one thing I didn't like much is the fact that you HAVE to use the valet. Granted, it's complimentary, but what kind of a jerk doesn't tip the valet? ...  ... We had meatballs for our app. Umm, delish!!! So moist and yummy, plus the toast that comes with was to die for! ...  ... Next was marguerita pizza. It was a little salty for my liking, but still very yummy. ...  ... We sat at the bar, and our waitress/bartender was SUPER sweet and attentive! I give her 5 stars all on her own! ...  ... Definitely will make this a regular spot, but I might ride my bike next time (they have bike locks on the patio!)
21	4	0	0	0	We love this place! Awesome atmosphere, great service and delicious food. We went with a big group and everyone loved their food. The fonduta appetizer was great, along with the funghi pizza, grilled chicken pasta and nutella dessert. Would definitely recommend!
21	4	0	3	0	Starters: ...  ... - Grilled artichoke: Not a favorite for the table, but a definite favorite of mine.  Very beefy and full of flavor ... - Grilled calamari: Wow.  Silky smooth with a hint of the grill and the white bean ragu, which I was skeptical of, blended perfectly ... - Steamed mussels:  If not for being in public, I would have picked up the bowl and drank the broth directly.  The mussels were good too. ... - Braised meatballs: Very nice red sauce.  Might have been a tad too tender and I might have missed it, but I like a little bit of pork in my meatballs. ...  ... Main (I only have what I tasted to go on, but the rest of my party looked very happy): ...  ... - At the suggestion of the server, I had the scallops.  I wish I hadn't.  Although the description looked wonderful, it felt like the mushroom risotto, scallops, and shallots didn't mix well.  The shallots blocked out the risotto, which blocked out the scallops and the scallops, while tender enough, had little flavor.  That being said, the risotto by itself was very good. ...  ... Desserts: ...  ... -Salted caramel budino: I'd drive the 25 miles back here just for the dessert.  Just amazing.  The creaminess of the creme freche topping with the salt and caramel was perfect.  Again, if I wasn't in public, I would have licked the small cup clean.   ...  ... Very good wait staff and nicely timed for a large group.  Next time, I'll try the gluten free pasta instead of one of the meats and see how that goes.  Can't wait for more budino!

The bellini and my friend's drink (the cocktail w grand mariner) were both delicious.  We split a cinnamon roll which was amazing esp for $3.  We both got the veggie egg scramble.  Delicious!  And loved the restaurant's bread as well.  Service was excellent.

21	3	0	0	0	Love this place! ... Great ambience  & delicious food! ... I had the spicy shrimp pasta & it was absolutely amazing!!! ... The problem is the absolutely TERRIBLE  service!!!!!!!! ... They r slow, rude & unhelpful!!! ... Seriously it's a pity that the servers r so lacking!
21	4	0	0	0	This place has just gotten better for me since I first began coming here shortly after it opened.  Things I especially enjoy are their zucca chips, smashed tomato pizza (a chef's special that night), the spicy pasta with shrimp, and the happy hour - Oh the happy hour!  It is great, and goes all day long on Sunday.  Tremendous value and easily can get out for under $40 for a complete meal for 2 including wine if you take advantage of the specials.  I have also enjoyed several brunches here - they have a great patio with a fireplace for cold nights.

Although the staff had put my reservation on the wrong day, it was a Tuesday at 6 so we were able to get a table. The server was really nice, and I have to say the food was DELICIOUS. I think almost everyone at the table really loved the apps, entree, and dessert. I'll be heading back when I feel like Italian food. :)
21	5	0	1	0	The food is fantastic, the service its top notch and the atmosphere is wonderful.. ...  ... I live on my own and luckily live very close to north.. I go there a lot! Most of the time alone and enjoy dinner, wine, & espresso @ the bar.. I know all the bartenders and they are wonderful we all laugh and enjoy the evenings.. ...  ... All the regulars as myself all know each other and if its not a football game that night we will all move around and sit by one another and laugh and enjoy the great nights. ...  ...  ... Enjoy the outside views at night the bar is open cause the great weather.  ...  ... I cant think of one thing I don't like about this place. They give me this family feel when I come in.
21	5	0	2	2	The pizza, dessert, wine - everything is good here ! It's fun to watch them make the dough :) and the lights make it very pretty !
21	4	0	0	0	Think upscale barn meets trendy decor. Started with the Italian farm salad for a mix of Molinari salami, roasted red peppers, red onions, olives topped with thin slices of provolone cheese and just enough Italian vinaigrette. The fork kept coming back for more bites!! Then had a slice of traditional margherita pizza. And then devoured the ricotta gnocchi with small chunks of soft braised beef short rib, lightly covered with horseradish cream, and wilted arugula for a full flavored dish. And wait.....not done!! I know- I have an appetite for foodie food. Finished with the beignets that was complemented with a lemon cream sauce for dessert. All in all, the dinner was scrumptious, the ambience was lively and the place is telling me to come back for more! :)
21	5	0	1	1	Update to my previous review: ...  ... North is once again a favorite that I find myself frequently much too often. Excellent management, friendly (and dare I say very attractive) bar staff, delicious new drink offerings, and the free WiFi I've always loved. A great place to pull up a seat and work from my laptop.  ... They have also accommodated a menu request that my best friend asked for and have subsequently made it for me. We appreciate that tremendously. I plan to resume riding my cruiser bike to North to park it in the ample bike parking spaces as well as taking my car to the friendly, fast valet on the chillier nights. Excellent.
21	4	0	0	0	Great salad and atmosphere. I am definitely coming back whenever I am in the area.
21	5	0	0	1	I've never had a bad meal here at North. The service is always top rate. You must not leave without getting a side of creamy polenta. No seriously, get the polenta! Zucca chips, sweet+savory spaghetti & meatballs, chef's board... So simple but so well executed. I love North.
21	5	14	16	14	I don't really like Italian food.... there, I said it, it's true. You can begin submitting your hate mail. When anyone asks the question, "What do you want to eat?" Italian will rarely, if ever, come out of my mouth. However, that may have been changed by North Frattoria Italiana.  ...  ... Many of my Phoenix Yelp friends have been to and speak highly of North. I just realized that I can literally walk there from my home. At times, I'm completely oblivious to my surroundings. All this time, North has been sitting here, and I haven't taken advantage of it. Well, today that has all changed. ...  ... We came here tonight because my offspring loves Italian food... He may not actually be mine. I'm kidding, he's mine, bought and paid for.  ...   ... The first thing I noticed about North was the setting. Unlike the typical Mamma Mia... Ay you's guys... Ooh La La (actually I think that last one's French) atmosphere, North has a farm house feel. The staff was even wearing plaid shirts and jeans. I liked that laid back feel. I'm a country boy at heart so the farm-esque tone was comforting. ...  ... We started our food journey with the calamari and a seasonal chef board: ... The calamari was okay. The breading was a bit heavy and I thought it took away from the flavor and feel of the calamari. It's not something I would get again. ...  ... The seasonal chef board was good. It consisted of brussel sprouts, squash, asparagus, mushrooms, some kind of cheese and a few slices of really good bread. I liked it, but it was more for my lady. The veggies fixation is her thing. ...  ... For my main dinner I got the Ricotta Gnocchi. It's braised beef short rib with gnocchi served in a horseradish crema and wilted arugula. I love short rib, but I'm not a huge fan of horseradish. I asked our server her opinion and she assured me it all complimented each other. She was absolutely right. It was excellent. The short rib was very tender and the crema, meat and gnocchi all worked perfectly. Excellent. ...  ... I could have ended the meal there and been content, but we didn't. For dessert we ordered the Tiramisu and Bombolini:  ...  ... The tiramisu is served in a glass container rather than in sliced cake form, and is covered in playful little chocolate balls. I liked the presentation. It was cool looking and tasted great.  ...  ... The bombolini are Italian donuts. They had cinnamon and sugar on the surface and were plated on a lemon/vanilla mascarpone pudding-like bed. It all worked well together and my son, who is a bit of a "donut expert", thought they were very good.  ...  ... Overall, this was a wonderful experience. Everyone walked away happy and I found an Italian place that I could see myself frequenting... for that, 5 stars is in order.
21	3	0	0	0	I loved the atmosphere and the dcor of the place, along with the delicious food.  what knocked my stars down was the poor customer service. our server seemed to be having a miserable time serving us, not because my party was a nuisance, he simply seemed as if he didn't want to be there. it took him around 15 minutes to bring us our cocktails, and failed to refill our water while we were waiting. he did apologize for his lagging time though... ...  ... the small bowl of spinach tortellini I got was pretty tasty. the cheese melted in your mouth and the buttery flavor along with the spinach sealed the deal. delicious  mussels, and zucchini chips as well. Caesar salad, on the other hand, was ATROCIOUS. it literally seemed as if they bought a $2.50 bag of lettuce from Frys, grabbed a handful, spread it across the plate and threw some caeser dressing on it. it not only looked gross, but for a prices like that, I expected more, or at least a better presentation. ...  ... overall, its a super cute place to go on a date. the lighting is soft, the atmosphere is great but what  you pay for food and service is a little too much for what you get. not a bad place though, i would still recommend it to friends. I would just warn them to stay away from their salads.
21	5	0	0	0	It's pretty good food. Calling this "Italian" is not what you would think.  It has a nuevo  Italian flair.  it's hip and trendy.  The scallops were to die for, the pasta (Bolognese) was delish.  We also had as an appetizer one of those appetizer boards (we opted for the combo) and a chopped salad.  It was a great wonderful meal.  You must go.  They also have one in Kierland.  Too bad they closed their Westside location at 67th and 101.  :(
21	4	0	0	0	Food was great! The decor was rustic and cute. The service was excellent and the server was very nice. Although the service was good, it did have a flaw. Everyone's starters came, but my wife's salad was no where to be found. For about 10 minutes, we we're waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasn't coming any time soon. We had to ask a waiter to pass on the message to our waitress. And we found out that the salad was never even written down. But even though the salad came late my wife could care less about how late it was because it was so delicious.
21	5	1	3	1	Yup, trusting Yelp with this recommendation was a fantastic idea. I was in Arcadia and wanted Italian food, nothing specific per se, I just knew I wanted something Italian and North was one of the first restaurants to pop up. After conferring with my dinner party of four, we were off.  ...   We started with a pitcher of the best red sangria I've thus far experienced, winey yet fruity, spicy but mellow, it was good. Then we moved on to the mussels, which the table unanimously agreed that, even though between us we have eaten seafood all over the world, were the best version of any of the mollusk family we had ever eaten. Served in a butter sauce with slivers of garlic and salami, these things were damn near worth five stars alone. You must try them. Next best was the ricotta gnocchi, which although were very slightly doughy, had an incredible flavor profile with the horseradish sauce and ricotta. The seared diver scallops were also a hit, the scallops seared very well with a good cook, the risotto was tasty but got to be a little much at the end, it had a LOT of flavor. We also got a margherita pizza with a white sauce instead of the red, it was a good pie with a crispy crust and nice bite. The spicy shrimp dish was the low of the night, it did have a nice flavor but was just kind of a run of the mill pasta dish, I'd go with something more adventurous. ...   The fantastic food, incredible service(Stephanie I think), and inviting decor push this place over the top. North will for sure be in our regular rotation of restaurants from here on out.
21	5	0	4	2	Enjoyed the company of 30 fellow Elites today here at our "Wake Up at North" event this morning, which started with a fabulous Brunch! ...  ... *  MIni Granola Parfaits with almond granola, vanilla yogurt & fresh fruit! ...  ... *  Baked French Toast with vanilla maple syrup, fresh fruit & lots of whipped cream! ...  ... *  Short Rib Hash with sunny side up fried eggs! ...  ... *  Egg Scramble with spinach, mushroom slices, asparagus,  Zucchini & white cheddar cheese! ...  ... After this delicious feast, which was accompanied by Bloody Marys, Mimosas & coffee, we received a demonstration of how pasta is made from scratch, & even had a chance to make our own Tortellini! ...  ... The staff was lovely, a great time was had by all, and special thanks to LIndsey for another great Yelp event!     :-))
21	5	0	3	1	Was able to get a taste if their new brunch menu. Wow. Just as good as their lunch and dinner!  ...  ... We started off with their red rooster Italian style Bloody Mary. It was delicious and had parmesian cheese sprinkled in it - weird at first but adds a great salty bit! ...  ... We had some baked French toast with vanilla syrup, homemade whipped cream and fresh berries. We also had a great parfait with Greek yogurt sweetened with honey and vanilla, crunchy granola and fresh berries. ...  ... On came the heavier courses of a veggie scramble and a short rib hash. The veggie scramble was my least favorite but that's only because I'm not a huge veggie in my eggs kinda girl. The hash though- wow. Everyone's favorite. If you've ever had their gnocchi then you've had their braised short rib and it's amazing.  ...  ... Finish today off with a chat with the chef and a tutorial on how to make a tortoloni (yup not a tortiloni and I'm sure my spelling is off for both) then you can say I started my day in a pretty bad ass manner.
21	4	0	0	0	Place is good!  ...  ... Have been here about 3 times and it has always pleasing. Drove by the place for quite some time when I was on the way to Postino. It's definitely attractive from the outside so that made me check it out. Service is decent here and the food is great. Although, a few of their signature dishes need a couple tweaks. The spicy shrimp pasta first hits your pallet with a bang but you are soon left with a 'nothing' taste. I would attribute it to lack of seasoning. The spinach tortelloni is great but they put WAY too much butter. A seasoned chef would send it back. The theme of the restaurant (country) doesn't match the type of food they serve although it somehow works... ...  ... Pros ... -nice atmosphere ... -cool design ... -decent service ... -great food ...  ... Cons ... -some off tasting food ... -community seating
21	1	0	1	0	standard menu-- all the dishes we ordered lacked seasoning, as did our server.  ...  ... not the greatest concept, fox.
21	3	0	1	0	North has made big changes to their once awesome Happy Hour menu.  ... I was pretty disappointed that the spaghetti & meatballs and arancini balls have been removed... ... The bruschetta of the day was so oily we could not finish it, mortadella, cheese and oil soaked arugula did not show off what I know North is capable of... ...  ... On a brighter side, the potato, goat cheese and truffle oil pizza of the day was great. :)
21	5	0	0	0	Pasta, pizza and creamy desserts......everything made with lots of love right in house. Semi-upscale environment. Large patio with a roaring fire and heaters, allowing you to sit outside during the Arizona winter. Perfect romantic date spot. Phenomenal cheery servers who are passionate about the food. Will definitely return. If you haven't been, it's a must try!
21	4	0	0	1	Can you really go wrong with a fox restaurant? I don't think I have.. They're always been pretty safe choices whenever we pick restaurants and North was no exception. We started with a bottle of wine, Barbera. It came uncorked which I found strange.  Waiter said bartender opened. Maybe my restaurant friends can tell me if this is normal or not? Back to the food.. We ordered the calarami. It was alright. It's a litte too crispy and you really can't taste to calamari at all. I had the Strozzapretti as my meal. It was delicious and not too rich. There was also plenty of grilled chicken in the dish so the pasta didn't feel overwhelming. My husband had the Spinach Tortelloni. He loved it but it is very rich! I tasted it and thought it was great as well. We both agreed the Strozzapretti was the better of the two. Parking is mostly vallet unless you park across the street. Overall great experience!
21	5	0	1	0	Just when you think you know everything there is to know about this Fox restaurant, you end up being dazzled! ...  ... We've been many times and thought we knew what to expect.  Wrong!  The service was outstanding and the food just sublime.  Yes, this is North that we're talking about. ...  ... If you can request Jodi, then you'll be treated to staff with consummate knowledge about the menu and ingredients.  She is delightful and a tremendous asset to this popular restaurant group. ...  ... And the food was just SUPERB!  We began with the proverbial zucca chips and a kale salad that was the BEST kale salad on any restaurant menu!  The vinaigrette was terrific and there was just enough 'crunch' in the kale. ...  ... The patata pizza was an epicurean delight!  Pizza dough that was pure perfection!  Cheese and tomatoes that had a faint hint of fennel with aromas designed to make your mouth water. ...  ... The strozzapreti pasta with chicken, roasted mushrooms, Bloomsdale spinach, toasted pine nuts, and parmesan creme far surpassed our expectations.  Great texture, great flavor; would order again in a heartbeat. ...  ... The salted caramel boutini provided that appropriate topping of a delectable evening and is large enough for two to share. ...  ... Additional wait staff ensured that water glasses and wine were always full. ...  ... If this is consistent than North Arcadia is comparable to the best restaurants on the east coast and is working diligently at becoming one of the nation's premier restaurants. ...  ... You don't have to dress to impress, but casual elegance is in abundance.
21	3	0	0	0	I'm so torn between 3 and 4 stars. We have been to North (this location) only a handful of times. The food is always delicious but the service declines every subsequent visit.  ...  ... The pork tenderloin is so delicious if they don't overcook it but the polenta, sweet potatoes and balsamic reduction was finger licking delicious. The boyfriend ate almost half my plate because his chicken parm wasn't anything special. When we go back the tenderloin is all he can think about.  ... Goat cheese/beet salad is very yummy as is the Caesar. delicious croutons that seem to be made In house. Small portions but the entrees are so filling.  ... Short ribs are also delicious... That polenta I tell you! But the desserts are heavily lacking.  Pretty bland even if it does mention Nutella (my krypotonite!) I'd rather hit up a corner store for a pint of B&J.  ... I do like that they offer a slightly larger our of wine for a few bucks more.  ...  ...  ... We have sat at the bar and dinner tables during busy AND slow times. Water never refilled. Poured our own bottle of wine after the first initial pour. One server even opened our bottle away from the table and just walked up casually with it which I thought was kind of strange but maybe that's just how they do things there. Service is not friendly or particularly helpful which could set this place apart but shucks. Just mediocre at best
21	5	0	1	0	Appetizers... ... -calamari-so, I usually don't like calamari because it is chewy and gives an icky mouth-feel. I actually liked this fried calamari!!! Yum! ... -fonduta-a cheesy fondue with jam on top, doesn't taste tomato-y. I thought it was quite good and I ate more than should have been my allotted portion! ... -zucca chips-paper thin zucchini slices, fried; we got some lemon dip with them. Pretty darn good, especially when you consider how gross most zucchini is! ...   ... Entrees... ... -strazzapreti-a chicken pasta dish-actually freaking good. ... -short rib entree-this ties Becketts Table for me in ranking Best Short Ribs in Town! The veggies that come with it are super good too!! ... -pasta bolonese-my hub thought it was amazing and didn't particularly want to share, but I thought this wasn't exactly my fave, so it worked out well for us. ... -spicy shrimp pasta-it was good but not amazing. I'd stick to one of the above recommendations instead. ...  ... Desserts... ... -donuts-really good, melt in your mouth, with a lemon dipping sauce that's amazing. ... -tiramisu-delicious, less cake-y and more creamy than usual, and the chocolate balls on top were quite good. ... -salted caramel thing-my personal favorite. It was like a very rich creme brle that was very flavorful of caramel n salt.  ... All of the desserts are worth getting again. ...  ... -atmosphere-pretty loud (on a Friday night)... I had to shout across the table so my somewhat hard of hearing dad-in-law could hear me. ...  ... -service-very good. ...  ... All in all, a great dining experience.
21	5	0	1	0	Went to North for the first time on Sunday for the new bRUNch run club and LOVED IT!  There were forty five of us for this week's bRUNch club and we were given the patio to oureslves.  The servers did an amazing job handling the whole group and the food was AMAZING!  We had a set menu for the bRUNch group, and all the choices sounded great.  Had the frittata which was delicious and they had a great drink list.  Excited to check it out for lunch/dinner as well, and hope North can host another bRUNch soon!
21	1	1	1	0	I wish I didn't have to give a rating on this but Yelp needs me to do so.  I wont give this one star.  Worst place to eat.  When we get there I let them know we have a reservation, they look for it and can't find it.  So the hostess says to me you must of called another restaurant very snotty...excuse me.  then why when I hit the button for directions it gave me directions to this place?  My husband gently grabs my arm he knows me all to well.  He asks if there is any available seating.  We are told on the heated patio.  Ok fine.  The hostess comes around to show us the way and she is wearing a dress that is just a tad longer than a shirt, IT BARELY COVERS THINGS.    The waiters are dressed in jeans and tshirts.  Normally I would not complain about stuff like this however when you look at the price of the steak and the menu the steak is $35 you expect some sort of aviance/atmosphere.  This place did not have it.  So we get to our seats and there are no tables in "HEATED" portion of the patio they plan to stick us as far away as possible from any heater....I refused to sit there and surprisingly enough there was another table closer to the heated area but honestly we are still exposed to the cold weather.  I had to eat with my winter coat on.  Food was OK nothing real special somewhat limited menu.  I asked for a hot vanilla Latte since we were so cold.  No Vanilla so I did without.  While I was there I had to use the restroom.  There are 5 restrooms that either man or lady can use each their own stall.  I go inside and I turn to close the door behind me and there is no handle to grab to pull the door shut. So I push it open and hope it would slam closed...nope.  I ended up grabbing the coat hook on the back of the door so I could completely close the door and lock. The parking lot is very small and its only complimentary valet.   Its also very hard to walk on if you have heels on like I did.  By the way our reservation was at 6pm We should of just turned around and walked out.  I won't go back.
21	5	0	1	0	Love everything I've tried on the menu and they make a mean scotch on the rocks. I've had the pizza, mussels, and a few of the salads. All GREAT!
21	2	0	1	0	This used to be one of my favorite places until they got a new chef who took my favorite burrata salad off the menu. When I requested it, my (not very helpful) server asked the chef about it. The chef agreed to make it, but said it would "taste funny." Now why would I order something that the chef tells me will taste funny??? What a joke. I ordered another menu item and was not very impressed. They also used to have delicious fries that changed with the new chef. I'm not dying to go back.
21	4	0	3	2	I went here for brunch with the bRUNch group (a group in which you run a 5k and then get rewarded with brunch and beverages) a few weeks ago. Now, maybe I was really hungry from running, but this was pretty delish. I got the short rib hash and it was done right. The eggs were perfectly runny, the short rib was soft and flavorful, the potatoes were good....I'll be honest, I cleaned my plate. The mimosas were also top notch, as was the service. So why only 4 stars? They don't have any pancakes on their menu....why is this important? The husband is allergic to eggs and so he can't have any egg dishes or french toast, but can tolerate pancakes or biscuits and gravy...I wish this place would add some of those items to the menu so I can come here with him! Anyway, if they did that, I would be a regular.
21	3	1	2	0	North is the Martha Stewart of Italian Restaurants. It is expertly executed but it lacks an authenticity that you want in your local trattoria, an authenticity that really comes through in other local spots like Marcelinos, Veneto, Franco's or Pomo. That doesn't mean that you can't come to enjoy a good meal, a great looking setting, and a fun crowd.
21	4	0	0	0	I loved my first experience here on a date. I had THE most delicious lasagna ever! Came back last night with family and to my dismay, they had taken it off of the menu :( I still enjoyed my salad and Bolognese but will not be coming back as often.
21	4	0	1	0	The Zucca chips are delicious and it's a veggie- can't loose there! The Italian Farm salad is fantastic. For an entree I highly recommend the strozzapreti. If you like Kale salads it is great here with the salmon. I admit potatoes are a weakness but their smashed potatoes (not mashed but smashed) are great!
21	5	0	0	0	Came to North after a disappointing experience at The Henry with 6 of my friends.  Update to the ladies: the flooring situation is still treacherous, however the hardwood interior seems to have lost some of its shine.  ...  ... After briefly discussing our bad experience at The Henry the waitress thanked us for coming in and made some suggestions including the zucca chips (which we ate 4 bowls of!).  They have some great HH specials at North including a bottle of wine and a pizza for $20!  When the manager noticed our Zucca chips had been dished slightly low he brought an entire extra bowl for the table... what service.  We really had a great time here tonight chatting with the Manager, the servers and each other.  I sincerely feel that any mistake during the dining experience can be overcome by a smile, explanation and apology which was evident tonight when a pizza came out a little late.   I wish I had asked his name but Sam Fox needs to retain this awesome manager; he clearly pitches in, leads by example and was extremely involved in the dinner service.  The patio is beautiful, the food is amazing, and we saw two separate traffic accidents which was crazy.   ...  ... I enjoyed an AMAZING piece of salmon which I had asked to be cooked well.  It was perfect which I especially appreciate since chef's can sometimes hesitate to overcook fish (which is how I prefer it).  I loved the grain it was served on and the lemon olive oil drizzle just iced the cake.  A friend enjoyed a toffee dessert which was to die for, and since we were celebrating the manager even brought out a celebratory dessert for us to share.   ...  ... I HIGHLY recommend North for a romantic night out or for HH with friends!

She had the Peach Bellinni (sp?) and i had the Red Rooster (Bloody Mary). I wasn't a Bloody Mary fan until I had the Red Rooster very tasty, spicy and delish! The food was fabulous!
21	5	0	1	1	North...is Italian for the fucking bomb diggity!!!  ...  ... So I shop at the Fresh and Easy across the street from this place and literally can walk here from my condo...to say the least I kept telling myself I was going to go for like the last few years...but had failed to do so...and since I am part Italian...I felt it almost an obligated duty to check this place out...so tonight on a whim, me and a gf went to see what all the fuss was about.  ...  ... And to say the least..Woohoo! This is as good as it gets when it comes to Italian food. From start to finish, the service, the atmosphere, the food...it all was amazing.  ...  ... We started out with the bruschetta...now this is not your Postino's type bruschetta...this is a do it your self sampler Chef's board bruschetta, with the freshest ingredients I have ever seen. Fresh made bread. Literally I think they made it all from scratch. I think they have some mad scientist in the back, churning fresh butter and making cheese along with growing the vegetables...I am not even kidding...almost filled up on this.  ... I am not a fan of olive's but my date said they were the best she has ever had. So so good.  ...  ... For our main course I got the Chicken Pesto, so good...pesto pesto pesto if you like pesto this is it. Literally so much pesto even the chicken is green, smothered with pine nuts and parm cheese...literally melts in your mouth. She got the Chicken Parm. Simply Amazing...cooked to perfection. An as far as portion size...this thing was HUGE! We kept eating off each others plates...so good.  ...  ... We decided if we get married North will be the place we go every year for our anniversary.  ...  ... We both were so full, neither one of us even had room to try the desert.  But next time Gelato or Tiramisu for sure. ...  ... I have heard good things about this place, and am really glad we went. I heard it was pricey, but really it is not. Like $70 out the door for the two of us, and that included a few drinks and a standard 20% gratuity.  ...  ... If you have not been here I would highly suggest giving it a try. So good, well worth it. Everything was excellent. Well done Fox Restaurant Concepts. Well done.
21	4	0	1	0	Love this place!  I'd read about the Sunday all day happy hour, so we made sure to take advantage.  The arrancini appetizer was fantastic!  Fried cheesy risotto goodness in fresh tomato sauce.... Yum!  My favorite is their spaghetti.  I had it with sausage and fresh mozzarella.  It was one of the best bowls of pasta I've ever had.  My husband had the bolognese and really liked it.  For dessert, we had the bombolini.  They were delicious, a perfect small dessert to share.  We will definitely be returning to North again soon!

21	4	0	0	0	I do love me some Fox restaurant concepts! ... This was a great meal, but there is probably better Italian food to be had in the Phoenix area- go for a late dinner, when it's less crowded and service will be more attentive. I should add that my boyfriend did not like the calamari appetizer, but that may just be because he likes things super-fried.
21	2	0	0	0	This place is disappointing.  I like the open feeling of the place ... even sitting inside feels like I'm outside.  The service we had was adequate.  But the food just isn't all that good.  ...  ... I had the frittata (braised greens, potatoes, smoked mozzarella, arugula, grilled bread).  It sounds so tasty though I was expecting everything to be in the frittata except the bread but the arugula was on the side dressed with too much oil.  No real flavor.  The frittata had been covered with cheese and presumably reheated since it was lukewarm.  It was dry and bland.  I didn't taste any potato at all. The bread was average at best and could have used some butter and herbs. ...  ... I've been here once before a couple years ago and at that time I felt it was average.  I doubt I will return since it's not very close to me.  I would still consider it a great place for a drink. ...  ... I also want to address a prior reviewer who said Bolognese was traditionally served with linguine.  That is incorrect.  In Italy it's served with tagliatelle (which is very similar to fettuccine .. one is supposedly wider than the other but most people wouldn't be able to tell the difference).  The restaurant is not in the wrong here.
21	3	0	0	0	The food and service really was fantastic!!  Just that if I am going to pay this much for food I should be full afterwards. I am a pretty big fan of Fox Restaurants so I am not a hater but overtime I eat at North I leave feeling I didn't get the best value.
21	4	0	0	0	Great atmosphere, delicious cocktails and yummy food. I loved the Julietta cocktail, the zucca chips, and the pizza with the egg on it. The beet salad was lovely as well. Everything seems fresh and tasty.
21	4	0	0	0	Only 4 stars? Seriously? Let me explain.  ...  ... With the hostess telling me only 20 minutes, but ended up waiting longer = 4 stars. ...  ... With a half marathon to run the following day, and ordering just spaghetti and meatballs that was average, but spaghetti and meatballs taste the same for me everywhere = 4 stars. ...  ... However, the hostess did comp a free appetizer for our long wait, so that was awesome. In addition, the wifey and our friends from out of town had no complaints of the food, so that is deserving of 4 stars. I guess my only complaint is I have to try this place again with ordering something different. ...  ... Although the place was popping on a Friday night, and it has a great vibe for bringing out of towners or a date night. We will see you again North!
21	5	0	0	0	North is by far my favorite fox concept restaurant or actually my favorite restaurant in the Arcadia neighborhood.  The food is classic, has just the right amount of seasoning and flavor and is priced just right.  The decor is unique and brings a neighborhood feel to the restaurant as does the wait staff.  I have been numerous times and have had nothing short of an amazing experience.  It's never over crowded and the service is always great.   ...  ... This is a staple for me in the Phoenix area.
21	5	0	0	0	What can I say another fabulous Fox Restaurant.  We went for happy hour on Sunday. We got a deal deal on a pitcher of sangria with the chefs board. It was something even a snobby italian like myself truly enjoyed. I would recommend this place again and again.
21	5	0	0	0	Love this place! The service is great the drinks are good and the food yummy and all at a very reasonable price. The patio is great for dining and they showed tonight they can do well with a large group. The scallops were a little over seasoned but well done you must have the beet salad!!
21	2	0	0	0	Waited 45 minutes for a salad? Our server didn't check on us and we had little ones with us. The kitchen was backed up... It is a restaurant right, it's what you do?  ... Too bad, we have given this place a chance and every time the service is lacking. Go when you have plenty of time and aren't hungry, it takes a long time to get your food.
21	2	0	1	0	Overall the service was spectacular! Alyssa was prompt and kept the meal moving without it feeling rushed! You could tell she loved her job and was informed about the menu! ... The food on the other hand was nothing to write home about. I one word greasy. The oil on the gnocchi and spare ribs could be soaked up with a towel-gross. The cheese tortellini was overly oily as well. The only good dish was the bolognase which had a great flavor! Dessert was good but agin nothing great - we had the tiramisu. This is a neighborhood joint that I will not frequent again.
21	4	1	2	0	The potatoes here are ridiculously good.  And the castelvetrano olives with that fresh cracked sea salt... oh man. That's the stuff dreams are made of. I could probably be gluttonous and make a meal of olives and potatoes, with a Red Rooster to drink (their version of a bloody mary.) ... Service is usually good and my food has always come out of the kitchen quickly.  For Sunday brunch at 11am we didn't even have to wait for a table.  Prices are fair for the quality and quantity of food served.  The chicken salad sandwich is amazing.  French toast, yogurt with granola & berries are also very tasty if you're looking for breakfast.  ...  ... Just in case you need extra incentive, its happy hour all day on Sunday at North!
21	5	0	0	0	Amazing meal. Excellent service. Great outdoor bar while you're waiting for a table. The 25 minute wait went by like it was five minutes. Chicken Parmesan was amazing. As a tip take an Uber here because there's very little parking. But they do offer complimentary valet.
21	5	0	0	0	I love this place! The people are nice and the food is great. I personally love the sangria, it's the best I've had. Mainly because the fruit is grinded into the drink, making it a little pulpy. The kale salad and calamari are great, and my coworkers really enjoyed the pizzas. I would definitely come back here again. It gets pretty packed though which would be the only downfall, but that's how you know it's good! Wish they had one in SoCal!
21	4	0	0	0	Four stars because the service in the beginning was less than par. It began to get better as the evening went on. The boards for an appetizer is great and I absolutely loved my dinner of the bolganese. Prices are a little high for the portion size but it's fresh, real food, and good company. Will be back.
21	3	0	0	0	My wife and I have dined at North countless times over the years at the Tucson and Keirland locations and love the concept - casual Modern Italian.  that being said, the 40th street location could use a little work!  The food is good, but the service isn't up to par.  We ordered the charcuterie and the cutting board had a fat crack in it, and the jam from the dish dripped through the crack all over my pants, which is not a huge deal.  BUT, they didn't handle it that well - no sense of urgency, nothing comped, etc.  I don't usually expect a comp, but the table adjacent to us was getting all kinds of comps because of their meal being delayed!  Very weak if you ask me.
21	5	0	0	0	Love the vibe; open kitchen in a renovated barn.  I've been here a few times and I always get the same things because they're so good!  Usually started with the Calamari app, lots of arugula which I loved!  I die for the Gnocchi and Short Ribs in a creamy horseradish sauce, yummmm.  My BF always gets the Chicken Parm which fills him up.  Perfect portions and friendly staff!
21	5	0	0	0	Ridiculously good food!  Great service!  Love the ambience and decor.  A simple modern take on Italian making everything fresh in house and it's just delicious!
21	5	0	0	0	Went there for lunch and the food was fantastic! There is a free valet which helps as there seems to be limited parking. Their ice tea is a black/passionfruit blend that was very refreshing. Very trendy decor and I would definitely go back!
21	5	0	0	0	Gnocchi is the bomb. I always get the chicken sandwich for lunch. The apricot sauce just makes the sandwich. Order with the potatoes. The salads are amazing and the pizza is fantastic. I honestly have yet to try something there I do not like. Everything is fresh from homemade pasta to the meats on your Italian sandwich. Love this place.
21	5	0	0	0	Wow! Little did I know I would go to Arizona and find an awesome Italian restaurant.  I can tell when the taste is beyond good, I've been in great restaurants before...I've even been in Italy, I can tell... This good was so good I pretty much ordered everything on the menu, ate most of it and made me wish I've had a bigger sized stomach.  Seriously, this good is so well done you would not be able to stop eating it.  This was my first time in Arizona and I must say, next time here, I'll be here eating the same amazing food I had.  Meatballs were amazing, so was the Margarita pizza.  I had also artichokes and there was also the truffle chicken pasta,..overall, one of the best places I've been.  Highly recommend it!
21	4	0	0	0	Recently came here on a double date with another couple & this place is one of our favorite fox concept restaurants.  It's our "must-go" place for dinner whenever our friend visits from out of town. We come here quite often that we routinely order our "usuals".  Our couple friend always gets the spaghetti & meatballs which our friend claims "is the best spaghetti & meatballs ever", margherita pizza and the gluten free bolognese pasta. As for my boyfriend & I, we usually share the "pig" pizza & Italian farm salad. Oh and of course, to complete our amazing meal, us four will share a pitcher of their delicious & refreshing red sangria.  I'm usually not a fan of red wines but this is one that I love.  ...  ... So if you haven't tried this place...definitely DO!!! It's a great place to hang out with friends or a nice date.  And did I forget to mention that they have happy hour all day Sunday!!!...can't beat that.
21	5	3	4	4	My daughter picked this for her birthday meal. We had been to a Yelp event here in the past and have been wanting to go back and try it. Boy am I glad she picked this place. We started with the grilled artichoke for an appetizer. WOW! I had no clue how much I would love this. It has truffle oil lemon aioli and was amazing. I didn't want to share but did! For my meal, I had an italian salad with Sopressetta and added chicken. The dressing was light and refreshing and the flavor combination was amazing. I love that it was served on a board like the Charcuteri platters.  ...  ... Our server was great. She even showed us how eat the artichoke properly. She kept our drinks full, was attentive and answered all my questions. I loved watching the kitchen prepare all the food, and the atmosphere is great, nice and open and bright. Can't wait to go back and I am not sharing my artichoke next time!
21	5	0	0	1	Great service, decor, and FOOD, ...  ... I've only eaten here once, but highly recommend the bolognese pasta, strozzapreti, chicken parm & zucca chips! ...  ... The pastas are fresh and the flavors & portions are great!
21	4	0	0	0	Great food, great location and great staff.  The complimentary valet parking was a plus and made it hassle free to get inside the restaurant.  The layout is very nice and I love the atmosphere is emits.  Great for groups if you can reserve the seating.
21	5	1	5	4	The first time I tried to GPS "North" Google Maps laughed at me. "Really Irene? There are hundreds of streets that start with North." Despite my lack of inherent navigational guidance I found my way there.  ...  ... Dinner was a joy with a large group of people. I enjoyed the spinach pasta. Absolutely no feeling of guilt as it was so heavenly. I *did* regret missing Happy Hour. (It runs until 6pm. Wine is $4 a glass! Sangria and beer too!) I loved the ambiance and the incredible space. It was perfectly loud for new friends to have a good time. With gusto! ...  ... Fast forward to breakfast and I fell in love with the "Short Rib Hash". Eggs are involved. (Mom was doing it wrong all these years.) I forked my way through a gluttonous serving. Then I hoover'd down my neighbor's french toast. (The joys of communal eating.) The Red Rooster drink had just the kick of spice. I might have had two. (Shhh!) ...  ... Tonight I enjoyed a true Happy Hour. Vanessa at the bar is just *wonderful*. Full of energy she worked the bar. By that I mean she sprinkled her magic fairy dust and created smiles. (I didn't want to leave! Neither did any of my bar stool neighbors:) Hearing how much I enjoyed dark beers Vanessa offered  a Moretti by La Rossa.  ...  ... Vanessa is amazing at what she does. North Italia provides excellent fare. Be sure to sample the pizzas! I had the special of the day. The crust is right up there with New York style crisp. Heaven. (And a steal at $8!) ...  ... Save me a bar stool during HH. (Two can share a bottle of wine *and* pizza for $20!) I can't wait to go again!
21	5	3	3	3	Driving over 2300 miles in three days wears. It also wears when you have your father in the car and in order to have a conversation, you have to constantly repeat yourself because he refuses to admit he needs to get hearing aids. ...  ... Phoenix was our last stop before home: Los Angeles. I was determined to treat ourselves, since New Orleans and the McDonald's in Fort Stockton were terrible disappointments, so I picked North Italia. I'm not even one for Italian food, to be honest. Why should I pay $15 for a tomato smashed into a pasta, made of flour and eggs? I mean, seriously. Not that hard, not terribly flavorful. ...  ... Until, of course, I found this place. There was one instance where I actually liked italian food, and it was at Michael Chiarello's restaurant up in Yountville, where you have to secure a reservation two months early along with the Keller restaurant group. ...  ... Obviously, I'm going to start with a drink. I believe it was called the Julietta, a vodka, elderflower, and prosecco mixed drink that came with a pretty flower as a garnish. It became my new favorite in all the ones I've had between the pacific and east coast. Yelp told me to get the zucca chips, so I did, because I am a sheep. Baaah. That's sheep for, "You should get it. They're flash fried zucchini chips that taste like a slightly salty cloud, and are the perfect appetizer that won't fill you up before your meal." ...  ... Deciding on an entree was difficult. You see, the short rib and ricotta gnocchi looked good but - let's be real here - gnocchi is one of the easiest pastas to screw up. I went to a michelin star rated restaurant and ordered gnocchi thinking, "How could they?" and ended up getting an answer. So my expectations were certainly low. Instead, I was given pillowy pasta, with deep hints of ricotta, and some of the most amazing braised short rib I've ever had. Anywhere else usually makes their short rib saltier than the lick the cows get as a treat - but this, oh no. This was heaven. I could taste the beef in this spectacular sauce, and it was so good and simple. Never underestimate the power of simplicity. Good lord. ...  ... My dad had the strozzapretti, which I was not expecting to be good for some reason. I don't know, I have a crazy relationship with pasta. They hand-make it all in house, and just like the gnocchi, I felt as if I could eat it forever. Chicken, mushroom, fresh al dente pasta in a parmesan cream sauce. Amazing. ...  ... For dessert we had italian donuts with a vanilla marscapone sauce, and their nutella budino. The budino, topped with toasted hazelnuts, was great, but my favorite were the donuts. Airy things, dusted with granulated sugar and swept up with sauce, were the perfect way to end the evening. I was humbled, to be honest, and actually contemplated coming back out there with my boyfriend just to take him to the restaurant. It's still up for consideration, actually. ...  ... Make a reservation well in advance, I have a feeling this place isn't going to have slow nights anytime soon.
21	5	0	0	0	Very solid spot.  I highly recommend the Gnocchi it is out of this world.  Great service and staff.  Very consistent.  Bartenders make great drinks.  Venue is very cool.  With all that offered, this is a spot I would send friends to for sure.
21	5	0	0	1	Amazing as always. The service is great. The food is delicious. The decor is farm-dreamy. But, what else could you expect from Sam Fox? I'd recommend the chicken (chef worried I didn't have enough sauce first time I ordered it and sought my table out with an additional bowl just in case) or the spaghetti (noodles very clearly made in house and out of this world).
21	4	0	0	0	Love checking out new spots and saw this advertised in an AZ newspaper then yelped it and had to check it out. It's a simple spot with great good. We had the grilled artichoke that was tasty with the lemon zest aioli. We had a prosciutto, fig and arugula pizza delicious! They were accommodating to sub mushrooms on one half because my friend didn't eat prosciutto. The hostess were sweet and helpful and we called ahead to put our name on the list. Our server was  very attentive and fun. We had a great experience.
21	2	0	0	0	Daughters and wife took me here for Fathers Day, promptly seated on the patio around a great round table (party of 5) off to a great start !   ...  ... We sat and sat ,.. 5  minutes before anyone said Boo! Then five glasses and a carafe of tepid water were placed on our table by someone who quickly ran away. Another five minutes, and our server swings by asks curtly if we have any questions about the menu, we ask a couple to which we get rote answers, she flys off leaving us with no more information than when she showed up.  ...  ... She disappears for another 5 minutes before she comes back to take our order (we are now into our adventure 15 minutes) Orders are made around the table, and just as she takes a step to leave again, I stop her to ask if we might order some drinks? "Oh Sure" we place 3 drink orders,.. and ask about portion size of an appetizer, she confirms we need two,.. for our table of 5, I say "fine ..lets do two" 5 minutes later our drinks arrive (minuscule),  and 10 minutes after that our food arrives. No appetizers!   ...  ... When asked, our server replies with "Oh I thought you were just asking what it was,.. I didn't know you wanted some" amnesia taking over for the whole "If we order these,..how many do we need?" conversation,.. not totally surprising as that conversation was now 20 minutes old. ...  ... By now,.. you have the flavor of the service,,.... slow, inattentive and well,.. absentminded.  (and this is the kinder/gentler me saying this) ...  ... OK,.. that said,.. the food was A++ very good and plenty of it. (the only reason I did not give it 1 star)  ...  ... I am hoping this was an off day for the wait staff at North, because the competition in Arcadia is fierce,.. many options consistently outperform my Father's Day experience at North,.. I love FRC's food,.. but this service experience has repeated across several FRC restaurants, Sam; at your prices, you gotta get that service piece down!
21	5	0	0	0	First time at North. Had lunch on a Sunday afternoon, drawn to the gluten free options.   ...  ... For the six of us, we ordered the Happy Hour Bottle and Board, Steamed Muscles, Fonduta, Beet Salad, Tuscan Basil Tomato Soup (2), a side of pasta, Spaghetti and the daily Pizza. We also added a glass of Malbec Red Wine and two cokes for $114. Only $19 per person including apps and drinks. Good deal there.  ...  ... The charcuterie board was excellent. It had salami, spicy pepperoni, two cheeses, garlicky olives, candied apricot bits, asparagus, bread and some tasty nuts.  ...  ... For the meals, everyone enjoyed their plate. Mine was the pizza - a white pizza with smoked mozzarella, pepperoni and basil. It was the first white pizza I'd had in 20 years. Excellent pie.  ...  ... The service is definitely worth mentioning: Melissa gave us the perfect amount of attention, made menu suggestions, had good rapport with her customers and a charming smile. She made our meal better! ...  ... We will be returning, with more guests!
21	2	0	0	0	I'm an Italian-American from the NJ/NY area. Sorry, North doesn't do it for me. Some of the flavor ideas/combinations to me are a little bizarre and don't work. The ricotta gnocchi with short rib and horseradish crema to me was like eating a steak sandwich, rather than a pasta dish.  I just wasn't a fan of the flavors-well, the horseradish crema-which was the ONLY flavor in the dish. And as another reviewer pointed out, the pasta did have some oil (or butter?) visibly separating, which was a little unappetizing. My husband had the "house specialty," the pasta bolognese, which also wasn't so good. Limp pasta and sausage-heavy bolognese. -No depth of flavor, one note.  Sorry, fresh, delicious pasta dishes shouldn't be that hard to achieve for an Italian restaurant.  Fox Concepts' Olive and Ivy is much better!!!  It's consistently great. I also happened to have a yummy pasta dish at Fox Concepts' Arrogant Butcher - it was a sweet potato pasta dish. When combined with some of my husband's steak, that was pretty delicious. Without the meat for some savoriness, it was a bit sweet.
21	5	0	0	1	North was a very very great place. The ambience was great! It's a big open area, but very intimate.  ...  ... Our server was very quick and happy to serve us. I feel service besides the food is very important, bc if my service sucks my experience and appetite are lost.  ...  ... The Artichoke I had was amazing and I had never had one! Incredible first experience and appetizer. ...  ... I had the steak and it was cook perfectly and very well seasoned. ...  ... I will be going back. It's very inviting!
21	5	0	0	0	How can you not like everything about this place? BEST SPAGHETTI I have ever had! And really, who orders spaghetti out when it's so easy to make? No one, but you must!  Just happened upon it and wow, are you kidding me? It's like the evil critic in Ratatouille when he ate the ratatouille and was just transformed and mesmerized. A basic dish and yet still so fantastically good!  So, yes, all home-made pastas of course, fabulous environment, just a wonderful place. Oh the spicy shrimp spaghetti is amazing too. Sam Fox gets ALL my money!
22	4	0	1	2	This is me eating my words.  I mocked those who reviewed McDonald's locations and now I myself am doing that exact same thing.  Here's where I will try to redeem myself as a Yelper - I am not reviewing their food as much as I am reviewing the decor. ...  ... I will admit that McDonald's is a guilty pleasure of mine.  There are times their french fries call out to me in the night or I crave McNuggets dipped in sweet & sour sauce.  I may be drooling a bit right now, in fact.  What keeps me from frequenting there as I did in high school is both the knowledge of what goes into fast food and the fear of the oil and grease.  The fryer smell both draws and repulses me and I feel my skin getting greasy just from the proximity.  Nevertheless, if the call is strong enough, I will look beyond all that and get me a McMeal.  Such was the case recently. ...  ... After an evening of wine sampling ("wine tasting" would imply that it was in small quantities, which it was not) my fiance awoke with a mean McCraving.  He is a recently reformed fast-fooder and had gone from frequent visits to the drive-thru to having avoided it for nearly a year.  We decided that if we were going to cave, we might as well check out the recently-leveled-and-rebuilt McDonald's.  Figuring that they were new enough that the fryer, exhaust fans, etc. would still be free of too much buildup, we ventured inside. ...  ... This is seriously the best decorated McDonald's I have ever been to.  It has a mid-century modern feel to it with retro chairs, patches of dark wood flooring and what I can only describe as raised-circle-in-a-square ceramic tiles surrounding the drink/napkin/ketchup area.  I can seriously see some of the design elements being incorporated into a cool modern home.  Flabbergasting is how out-of-place it is in that area of town, where most commercial makeovers seem to involve stucco and tan paint. ...  ... We ate our food in awe of our surroundings.  Was this the future of McDonald's eateries?  Or just a fluke?  I'm hoping it's the former.  If I'm going to stuff myself with fast food, it would be nice to at least do so in a visually-pleasing environment.

22	1	1	0	0	This McDonald's needs some serious help from customer service. The manager melody should not be a manager but in the back peeling potatoes. They continuously get the order wrong and make customers wait 25-30 min for a redo. Go thru it yourself and see what I'm talking about . Melody's body language suggests she is burned out and does not hold the McDonald's core values.
22	3	0	2	0	What the Heck?!?!?! ...  ... I went in to grab a bite. The store was beginning to get busy and the cashier had a lot of people in line. I ordered and was waiting for my food. I noticed this redhead employee who was wearing a white shirt and black tie. I assumed her to be the manager, what caught my attention was that food was sitting and this women was busy TEXTING on her phone. Why would you text during work?? Then I watched her finish and place the phone in her back pocket. Without walking over to WASH her hands she picked up food bagged it and handed to customers. Then walked back over and started the text message again. REALLY? Not only are you too focused on the texting, but also cross contamination of food. I really do not know how clean you phone is. I am surprised that more people did not notice it. When it got to my food I asked that she wash her hands to pick it up or have someone else.  Beware of this location.
22	1	1	2	1	If I could this place no stars I would.  Slowest drive thru ever. Literally took 20 minutes to order. Then I was told to pull up and wait some more after I paid. They actually have designated spots for you to wait in which tells me they know how slow they are! This is not what I call fast food. NEVER AGAIN.  Next time I will just drive down the street to BK or Wendy's.
22	1	0	1	1	How often is it you see a chain fall so far from the standards for such a long period of time and yet corporate seems to just let them limp along.  It's a new , ok relatively new building but it doesn't look it.  ...  ... Tonight is the second night we've been in a two month period were  no fountain drinks no cafes or drinks other than bottled water, apple juice or milk were around. It's not like we frequent the place but  when someone puts out a habanero burger I feel obligated to support em.  ...  ...  Sadly the burger was the least juicy, scant of dressing one I've encountered so while it hints at getting hot there's not enough  on it to find out.  ...  ... They appear, no let's be bold here and state it , they reheat / refry  their "premium" crispy chicken wrap   it's nasty even before you get to tonight's surprise which is rancid ranch... Yeah a bite and a run to the trash can to hurl it out.. ...  ... As usual  no receipt, no real F's given about the lack of drinks, slow service  in fact  the opposite of the one up at T Bird / I17   If you have to eat  fast  and can go the extra couple of miles it probably will save you time and  result in edible food

23	4	0	1	0	Good priced shoe brands like Nike, Adidas, Aerosoles, Clarks, Born, New Balance, and so much more. If you have the loyalty card, you can earn discounts on purchases. Usually has an ongoing promotion, Buy One Get the 2nd Pair for 50% off. (Yeah, I know, really trying to get you to buy more without having to twist your arm.) I used to shop here a lot but lately been browsing;  still trying to figure out my final decision. (See, I've been debating buying things online to earn more miles with Hawaiian Airlines.) ...  ... I like the set-up, continuous rows of shoes according to type of shoes- flip flops, sandals, heels, boots, athletic, toning shoes. All the accessories like socks are in one section. One side is womens and the other is mens. One section dedicated to clearance shoes according to size in the far right corner, for ladies. Because the set-up is easy, so is finding what you want. And there are pantyhose footie cheapies (located in boxes nearby) to wear if you're sockless. Plus, benches and mirrors to further assist you in your shoe purchase.  ...  ... A dependable source for all recognizable shoe brands.

I do a fair amount of shopping at the Famous Footwear location in Honolulu, and I don't mind saying that I would visit this location on future trips to Las Vegas. ...  ... I liked the selection as far as casual and dress shoes, and was happy to have found a pair of Steve Madden shoes for an affordable price (in my humble opinion).   ...  ... NOTE:  If you're a fan of Steve Madden shoes, there are more men's shoes selections at this outlet location than there are at the actual Steve Madden store at the very same shopping complex.   ...  ... SERVICE:  Top notch.  Friendly and helpful sales associates are present throughout the store. ...  ... Bottom Line:  Great selections and customer service.

Just like the Sprouts they got over in California, the workers are really bitter and pissed off all the time. You constantly see workers fighting with each other and then while they are still angry they will take it out on the customers. ...  ... Just like in  California, the butcher and deli jerk will pretend that they do not see you in a lame attempt to avoid work or  any verbal interaction. ...  ... Unlike California, the bread selection sucks. The sourdough in the California locations was from a local bakery in SD. The sourdough here in the LV location tastes like wonder bread.  ...  ... Unlike California, there is no Spanish speaker to assist non-English speaking Latino customers. Last time I was here,  I saw Latino customers who couldn't get any help because they didn't have even one Spanish speaker working that day. Even Korean restaurants have Spanish speakers on staff. So, what is going on here? ...  ... In California, Sprouts were always located in upper-middle class areas such as Rancho Cucamonga, Temecula, Carlsbad, and San Diego. This Sprouts shares the same shopping center as a Goodwill, winos, bums,  and an alley full of stray cats. Whenever I get out of my car there is always a f*cking cat there. ...  ... +1 star for having the freshest produce in Las Vegas, and not being a douchebag hangout like Whole Foods.
24	5	0	2	0	This place is sort of a cross between Trader Joes and Whole Foods. In other words, cool and interesting food with out the outrageous prices(Yes I am talking to you Whole Foods). They a great produce department. I am told they have a very good vitamin/herbal area (I don't fully understand the Hippie side of the store, although one must pass thru it in order to get to the booze.)Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!
24	2	1	3	2	I was and still am a regular customer of Sunflower and now Sprouts. I am not, however, happy with some of the products that I was fond of that have disappeared from the shelves. I like the fresh meat section, particularly the chicken and pork products.  I don't know if the beef is still provided by Harris Ranch so I just don't bother with it. the produce could be much fresher and from the USA not Mexico.  I know this because I shop in a Latino market that sells USA produce at much cheaper prices than Sprouts.  ... I also agree that the employees are not happy like they seemed to be when it was Sunflower and I don't recognize any of the employees there anymore so they must have hired all new.
24	3	0	1	0	I like this place, it is laid out well. I find it easy to get around and find whats in the list. Some prices are high but organic and specialty items usually are, in general most of the prices are affordable. ...  We got the premade meatloaf and no one liked it at all. ...  They carry Boarshead deli items. ...  They have plenty of carts and even a few tables in front to eat if need be. ... Staff were nice. ...  Lots of produce, and frozen foods. ...  I prefer this place to whole foods which is obscenely expensive, not sure if I like it better than Trader Joes though. It sure beats big Mart stores their food makes us sick. ...  Oh and there are a lot of seed and nut and grains choices you can get by the pound which I love because I am nothing like a costco customer, sometimes all you need is a little.  ;)
24	4	1	4	1	Used to be called the Sunflower Market. The prices can be a little deceptive, you can find actually similar items for the same price at Whole Foods. Check out my reviews for the other Sprouts market on Flamingo. It's pretty much the same.
24	2	1	1	1	I really like the Sprout's brand, having shopped there regularly when I lived in San Diego. Something is amiss with this particular store. I'm not sure it is the area or what, but this Sprouts does not live up to it's reputation in SoCal. The produce prices are the best in town, and double ad Wednesday is amazingly awesome. But that's there the awesomeness stops. The employees here are not friendly. They had Pink Moscato on sale and was excited to grab it for a great deal. I waited in line for a good 10 minutes without the line moving. There was some crazy homeless guy who cut in front of everyone, then didn't write down a number on his bag of bulk items. Having been aggravated by stupidity, I switched lines only to see this dumb little sign saying that it was a no alcohol line bc the cashier couldn't handle alcohol. I can understand if the cashier was under 21, sure. But this lady was middle aged. Look, if you can't handle alcohol in LAS VEGAS, then you shouldn't be a cashier...work in another part of the store! And if you sell alcohol, like Sprouts does, make sure your cashier's are qualified. I was so annoyed, I didn't buy anything. Which is sad bc I like Sprouts and their great produce, but this location is a trainwreck.
24	4	0	1	1	This was Sunflower.  Same location, and friendly staff.   ...  ... Read the Sunflower reviews, as i do not see a way to link them, but new owners have modified the in-store selection a bit... ...  ... This is a store with a good selection of organic vegetables and fruit, in my opinion this is good we now have a choice.   ...  ... Check the Milk you might be surprised that organic has a much longer shelf life, and it tastes like the milk you grew up drinking.  I had not noticed my milk had gone downhill in taste, and my ability to keep it in the refrigerator was a battle I was losing. Sprouts thank you for bring organic milk, that I finish before the expiration date arrives.    ...  ... JR
24	2	0	2	0	I miss Sunflower Market. Gone are the days where I would avoid going to Whole Foods because I could find a wide variety of health food for a fraction of the price. Now the stores tend to run the same.
24	4	2	9	4	You want to find the most choice of locally grown and organic produce and fruit, come here! I went crazy the other day and picked up 2 or more of each and every fruit and type of apple,oranges and pears they had! Yes I did. Tasted them all and will be back to pick up some more because they all of passed the texture and taste test! Prices were pretty reasonable too!   ...  ... Noted alot of merchandise they carry is a mixture of the other upscale healthy grocery store as well. Some prices cheaper, some prices at the same level I pay. This place has the feel of Wild Oats from back in early 2000..(before WF entered the scene) Gotta face it that I have to pay the price to eat and manage a healthier lifestyle. ...  ... They have a smaller selection of health & beauty products here. In my opinion more selection of paraben and sls free products at the other specialty store. About the same prices too.  ...  ... No long waits to get checked out, cashiers are friendly. Don't let the storefront or unkept surrounding area deter you from shopping here. The inside of this place is clean and employees are good about upkeep at produce and fruit departments.  Plus I like they knew where produce was from down to which farm it came from. Nice!
24	2	0	1	0	I started shopping at Sprouts when I was looking for a cheaper alternative to Whole Foods.   ...  ... The Pros: They have killer specials on a lot of processed foods that are always pretty expensive at Whole Foods (Lara Bars, Late July, Emergen-C).  Overall the store is reasonably priced.  Shopping at Sprouts cut my usual grocery bill in half.  I just don't think it is worth it. ...  ... The Cons: ... They promote local(ish) meats, meat raised in the US, as if this is something to set them apart from other groceries.  But they are vague about the origin of the meat.  The last time I purchased meat at Sprouts, I returned it only 2 days later (2 days before the sell by date) because both cuts were spoiled already.  Badly spoiled.  This is a deal breaker for me.  If I buy spoiled meat from your "butchered fresh daily" butcher, I can't go back. ...  ... Their produce is supposed to be local, but much of it is the same that you will find in any grocery.  Their non-organic produce is very reasonably priced, and they have some good deals on the organic stuff too, but it is nothing special and certainly not worthy of the "farmer's market" spin that they put on it. ...  ... They don't always have what you bought last week.  Their stock seems to shift, based on what they can get at a discount (to sell to you at a discount), but this is really inconvenient when you come to rely on certain grocery items weekly. (Edamame and other frozen veggies change regularly.  The other day I went and they were completely out of pretzels, completely).  ...  ... Bottom line, I don't like that Sprouts markets itself as a local farmer's market type store.  I have not found this to be true and it isn't up to snuff as far as quality grocers go.
24	5	0	2	1	This healthy market is in a dilapidated strip mall that is half empty, in a terrible area, and it is simply a gem! ...  ... 1. Daily Deli - They have a great deli to make sandwiches, soups and etc out of great ingredients. ...  ... 2.  The stuff - Besides you healthy fare of veggies, fruits, organic type stuff, they have a large selection of bulk grains and nuts. drinks, vitamins, waters, frozen foods, hard to find ingredients. ...  ... 3.  The staff - Always friendly, never too busy. ...  ... 4. The location - Southwest corner of Trop and Pecos. Where Wal-Mart and Sam's Club is. ...  ... 5.  The weird stuff - Every look for Braggs Amino Acid?  You have to go all over.  They have it here. ...  ... This place is like Trader Joe's and Fresh n Easy, just bigger, more selections and not too packed. Not sure how they survive and make money, as it never seems busy, but check this place out. ...  ... I give it a 5 star all around!
24	4	2	2	1	In my recent quest to get my pre Yelpers body back I have been spending a lot of time here!  I have been doing a meal replacement of juicing a great way to add so many nutrients to your diet and a great way to loose weight.  However by doing this you go through an enormous amount of fruits and veggies.   ...  ... In this diet you go thru such a large amount of fruits and veggies you really have to follow the rule for the dirty dozen.  On this list is the foods you should buy organic in accordance of what they are spraying heavily that year.  I have come to rely on this store for my organic purchases.  Huge selection in that area and a nice selection and no overly priced for the other veggies I need. ...  ... The employees start to recognize you after a while and are fast and efficient and very friendly.  I notice they are also always around the store stocking and cleaning.  I plan on continuing this lifestyle and this will be one of the stores I rely on!
24	5	0	2	2	I LOVE Sprouts. Great selection of Organics and vitamins without the crazy prices. I highly recommend!!!!
24	1	2	2	1	I haven't been here since it was called Sunflower Market, so I decided to see if something more came with this name change. More like something less.... ...  ... The store seems a bit bare in comparison to when it was Sunflower. They no longer offer vegan baked goods, which sucks. My mom liked the meat section for the decent prices for smaller portions of food before, but they no longer have. ...  ... They are way overpriced in comparison to Whole Foods. Yes, Whole Foods, and they can be pretty pricey as we all know! Selection of vegetarian and vegan foods in the frozen food section is still on par, but as mentioned, way overpriced. ...  ... To add insult to injury, there was this jackass of a stock person who cut me off twice while speeding through the produce section with his cart full of inventory and didn't apologize during either occasion! Poor customer acknowledgment and appreciation. At least the cashier was super friendly. ...  ... Easy to say that I will never step foot in these stores again, especially this particular location.
24	4	0	0	0	I liked this location a little bit more when it was a Sunflower Market, but not much has changed. Sprouts is cheaper alternative to Whole Foods. It has a neighborhood feel to it and is not as sterile as the normal chain grocery stores. Going here is a bit of a hike for me, but I still find time to stop in when I am running around the Valley, as it is one of the better grocery stores aorund.
24	2	0	1	0	I had a much better experience when this place was Sunflower Market. Now that it's Sprouts, I feel completely unwelcome here. Not one person greets you. Not one. Not one person asks you if you need any help. Not one. And to top it off, today I got the worst attitude from two of their cashiers ( the short white middle-aged woman who appeared a bit rough around the edges and the young skinny black girl with short hair). First off, I wasn't even greeted when I came up to the register. I said 'hello, how are you?' to the cashier (the white lady) and she didn't even answer back, but seemed really annoyed. She didn't even look at me or make eye contact with me. Just started ringing and bagging me up, with this stoic 'I hate my job' look on her face. As I was putting my bagged items into my cart, I turned around and she was gone. In her place was the black girl. She didn't say hi either. After ringing me up and giving me my total, I swiped my card and put in my pin. The pin was wrong. I had just gotten this card and I thought I had memorized my pin number, but I guess not. My phone (that had my pin on it) was in my car, so I asked if I could run out and get it. The black girl rolled her eyes at me and exhibited complete and utter displeasure towards my question, as if I completely ruined her day. And she didn't even answer the question, she just sat there, rolling her eyes, hesitating as if, in that very moment, a magical money-fairy would come down and zap cash into my pockets with her magic wand. I asked her again, if it would be ok to grab my phone, and she eventually said that it was fine, but with this hideous attitude. So I ran out and grabbed my phone, which literally took less than a minute (the Spouts parking is an empty void most of the time, so snagging a parking spot right out front isn't that hard). Anyhow, I get back and the white lady is standing there again. I'm thinking, 'oh great, not her again' and of course, her reaction towards the situation is to be completely patronizing. Finally I leave. I mean seriously? I'm a regular customer here. My husband and I shop here every other Thursday. A little respect would be nice. It was already shameful enough that I had forgotten my pin number and had to run out to my car and grab my phone, holding up the line. Then to feel degraded by these incompetent nimrods on top of it. . . . well that was just completely unacceptable. Needless to say, I'm disgusted. My husband and I will be joining our local buying clubs (a far better option) anyway, so thankfully I won't have to put up with them much longer.  ...  ... P.S. in case anyone is wondering why I didn't just charge my card. Well, because I don't like doing that. I'm looking out for businesses that I happen to support such as whole food markets like Sprouts. I would rather my retailer not have to pay a fee to the bank every time I charge my debit card. But, I guess it doesn't matter when a business such as this, has idiot cashiers who conduct business in a gross manner. Screw them.
24	4	0	0	0	Well, a lot of reviewers seem to feel that this place has gone downhill since it was Sunflower, but honestly, other than the marquee, I see no difference at all. Still lots of fresh produce at good prices, and it's never nasty and bug-ridden like at Food for Less or flavorless and unripe like Walmart, and really a deal with the double-ad Wednesdays. They also feature my fave, the meat counter with actual live personnel to  weigh and wrap items like their house-made sausages in a lot of varieties, and the rest of the meat is not always the cheapest but I have never had an issue with the quality or tenderness. They also have a couple of aisles of bulk foods, ranging from quinoa and granola to gummy bears and chocolate-covered nuts (MY kind of health food!) They have a small bakery section, and if you get there in the morning the chocolate croissants are still warm - ooh la la! There are lots of organic items and crap that is vegan, gluten-free, etc., but for folks like me that skip the tofu and figure that if I'm not getting enough vitamins in the mass quantities of food I eat, no supplement on Earth is going to save me, you can steer your cart right past that and go straight to their very respectable wine section. They carry Boar's Head products in the deli, too, which are no pricier than anywhere else, and lots of cheeses, flavors of hummus and Babygirl's favorite fresh salsa. Never had an issue with any of the staff- always friendly and helpful. Not really the place to do all your shopping unless you don't own a razor, but great for stocking up on the produce.
24	3	3	4	2	This place is an OK find for more natural produce. ... However, I get a tad disappointed in their fish and meats department. ...  ... A lot of their fish is "previously frozen". Which means that they get it frozen, and then defrost it, and sell it to you. Meaning that you can't freeze it when you get home.... I guess it would be okay if you were going to eat it that night..... but still, that's gross to me.... ...  ...  I can get previously frozen fish from just about any where.
24	5	0	0	0	Great market! They play oldies which are very catchy. The store is pretty clean. Always nice service. They do have good prices on seasonal produce. And the produce is ALWAYS wonderful. They do have a lot of "previously frozen food"...so take what you want from that...they are competitively priced with whole foods on organic stuff, maybe even cheaper. But they carry many non organic foods as well. Olive bar is nice. And many foods in bulk.
24	4	0	0	0	Great selection. The best produce in town. Their dairy is a little expensive to outrageously overpricd but its delicious. Everything is a cut above. Their organic produce is reasonable considering the premium for organic. Their staff knows exactly what they are selling. They have a great variety of vitamins and hippie stuff. They have the latest delicious foods.  ...  ... The one star deduction is because the neighborhood is super sketchy.
24	5	0	5	2	This place is mildly addicting... I feel like im here at least 5x a week. Whole Foods quality with Trader Joes prices, this place is amazing for gluten free, antibiotic free, hormone free, organic food. They also have a pretty decent Wine and Beer selection. With everything carefully labeled GF, Vegan, Organic etc its very easy to find what you need here. Not as many items as Whole Foods but it gets the job done. I suggest everyone to shop here for groceries/ supplements.
24	5	0	1	0	This is without a doubt my favorite grocery store in town!  I do not even live anywhere in the area, but I stop by a couple times a week for my food needs. ...  ... The deli counter workers are incredibly amazing and one in particular always goes so far above and beyond what I expect for customer service.  I love ordering the fresh-made for you sandwiches at the counter and they are my favorite lunches in town! ...  ... Great prices on most things and incredible quality!
24	3	0	0	0	UPDATED:  10/10/13  ... I don't know what happened, but fortunately, they seem to be cleaning up their act. The last two times I was there, the food was much fresher, no rotten produce and decent prices on organics. I'm not exactly sold yet, but I'm happy to see that there is improvement brewing. ... _________________________ ... What has happened to this place??? I used to love it here, when it first opened as Sunflower, it was great, the prices were low and the food was pretty good. As the years went by the quality started to change.  ...  ... The first thing I noticed is the fruit tends to be pretty tasteless, but that is nothing to what I experienced there today. ROTTEN FOOD, I mean come on, the produce guy was setting out fruits and vegetables, but I guess he is either blind or doesn't care at all. The corn was rotten, old and dried up. The packaged cucumbers were so bad that they were moldy and were so rotted they were almost liquid.  ...  ... I have seen brown meat, that I wouldn't give to my cats.  ...  ... I also find the music they play annoying, but most of the customers are in their late 60's or early 70's so the old time music probably fits their customer base.  ...  ... The only reason I go is because I take my mom there, she continues to hope it will get better, but I only see it getting worse.
24	4	0	2	0	We love this grocery store and whenever we have to drive to East Las Vegas, we usually stop for something or other at Sprouts Market.  The employees are friendly, on more than one occasion I've called the butcher and asked them to cut or grind something for me.  When I arrive, it has always been waiting for me.  The produce prices are fantastic and I've never had an issue with the quality.  There is a decent beer selection, although prices are not as low as they are at Total Wine or Lee's.  More craft brews than at your usual grocery store.   ...  ... I'll say we've had some hits and misses on the prepared foods.  The meatloaf was too bland for example.  But, we have had some good items as well.
24	5	0	0	0	Ya, good stuff in here for sure and less expensive than whole foods. Bulk section is small, but there is enough to keep you occupied, produce is looking better than in past months, and the prices are good on things in season. Meat section is pricey, but good. I do pick up Gluten free bread mix here, and they have Boars Head at reasonable prices. Beer and wine from all over the world, and a large health/beauty section..
24	5	0	0	0	I've been to both Sprouts stores and I like how each store does have a little something different to offer. This one has my favorite milk brand, Straus, that I've come to only find at Whole Foods. (Sidenote: it is a must for ppl to try especially if you're not lactose intolerant or even drink milk on a regular basis...you'll taste a big difference).  The prices for produce are cheaper than While Foods, but you can make your own judgment call on the quality of it.  I do love the double ad Wednesdays which both store locations are known to have.  Come Wednesdays as there is a guy who likes to sample goodies and is the friendliest person you'll find in Vegas...somebody I note as the Sprouts ambassador.  Oh, and you might see me working too that day.
24	3	0	0	0	Sunflower used to be my go to spot for groceries.   However, since being acquired by Sprouts, prices have gone way up and service has gone down.  The people who work here are very nice, but turn over is constant, so the workers are not experienced.  Still a solid store, but I mostly shop at Trader Joe's now since I get a lot more organic produce bang for my buck there.
24	5	0	0	0	We like this grocery store a lot. The meat is always fresh and hormone free. Their produce always looks and tastes great. The cashiers and baggers are always nice and I've never had a rude employee help me out. I just wish it was closer to where I live.
24	5	0	0	0	It's my favorite store for grocery shopping. The quality of produce, meats & fish is very high, but prices are not as high as in Whole Foods. I'm happy to have this store very close to my house. Highly recommend!
24	3	0	1	0	A decent store with more healthy options than other places, but feels like a glorified Trader Joe's.  Produce is good, but quantity and quality vary wildly.  Their boxed and frozen section would be average in my book. ...  ... Not all their meat is grass fed or organic, and the meat that is grass fed more than double normal pricing.  I'll pay good money for quality safe meat, but double price for average meet, no matter the source, is just silly.   ...  ... Staff is friendly, but lacks serious knowledge of the products they sell.  Questions about how to prepare unusual items or their contents are met with blank stares. ...  ... I shop here because it's close and serviceable, but I now have a bakery and butcher I'd rather use.  As soon as I can find a better source for produce I will probably abandon Sprouts all together.
24	5	0	1	1	Their prices are reasonable -- considering that it's a specialty grocery store. Wish it was located closer to my neck of the woods! ...  ... I passed this grocery store on my way to another destination, and on my way back I decided to drop in to see what they're all about. I was very pleasantly surprised to see that their prices are so reasonable. In fact, I found their prices on oranges really attractive. They are being sold for 48 cents a pound - cheaper than Costco's prices at the current time. I bought a big bag of oranges and I also found a healthy snack of sweet potato chips. They were 2:1 on sale, so I got that too. I'll be sure to come back the next time I'm in the area. Great prices and great assortment of healthy choices!
24	4	0	2	1	First visit to Sprouts and I enjoyed it. I looked over the flyer that was sent in the mail and it sparked my curiosity. It's hard to believe some of the prices that were advertised but it was true. So many healthy choices both organic and non. The store looks small when you first walk in but walking around it's just that's it's perfectly laid out. My first visit but definitely not my last. I hope this stores stays as reasonably priced as it is today.
24	4	2	4	2	Sprouts market has always been good to me.  It's not located near me but they have a few grocery items that I love and will make the drive for.  Soon enough they will be opening 2 new locations in the Henderson area which I'm giddy about!  It is a good store to find those gluten free or organic type foods with a huge variety to choose from. ...  ... For this location, the store is huge, clean and organized.  Their different departments are easy to find with just a glance.  The produce always looks fresh and neat.  I find their prices aren't too shabby either!   ...  ... One thing that lacks here compared to one of my other favorite grocery stores is their customer service from their checkouts.  The lines move very very slow and rarely say a word to you as they are checking you through.  ...  ... I am looking forward to the new stores closer to me....  Thanks Sprouts!
24	5	0	1	0	A lot like whole foods but more affordable, different selections. Feels like a neighborhood grocery store that just happens to have lots of great products that a health conscious person would seek. I love the stuff in the butcher section. I definitely recommend it.
24	3	0	0	0	I think the employees at this location are fairly friendly for the most part. Though I love most of their selection I do think some of their items are high priced. I would love to buy more supplements or vitamins but I simply can't afford it. I think their free range meat options are lacking.
24	5	0	1	1	If you're into organic produce, Sprouts has the best selection of any store in town, except MAYBE Whole Foods. The prices are way better than Whole Foods, though, and they're even better than Trader Joe's because a lot of TJ's organic veggies are pre-packaged.  ...  ... Sprouts also has a good selection of organic, grass-fed meats. Probably better than anybody else because even Whole Foods' butcher shop devotes only a very small percentage to organic/grass-fed. ...  ... The personal item area with natural vitamins and face wash and stuff is big, but not as big as WF. I can't comment on the quality, though, because I never buy that stuff. ...  ... Overall, it's my go-to grocery store. I get everything I need for almost as cheap as Smith's, but with a lot more organic/natural.
24	3	0	0	0	Shop here every week - its the closet one to my house.    ...  ... Today, I discovered that Thursdays are a great day to go, a lot less busy than on Wednesday when their new ads come out and they still honor the old weekly ad too.  ...  ... I enjoy the foods here but have found that they don't always have what I'm looking for. ...  ... In talking to the produce clerk, I learned that is out of their control at times about when things come in like Organic Gala Apples.   (haven;t seen them in weeks)  ...  ... Also noticed the organic red leaf lettuce was a bit small but they were on sale so helped a bit.  ...  ... Always friendly and helpful staff here-  ...  ... Visited New on on Stephanie once and it is  not as big as the store on Tropicana, but they seemed to have more stuff.  ...  ... No matter.....love Sprouts
24	4	0	0	0	I like this place because it carries a wide variety of specialty foods.  I have never liked the "organic" pricing.  Organic food is grow with chemicals...let's be clear.  Are they better chems?  Don't know, I'm no micro-biologist, nor chemist.  I can tell you that farms pay institutions that deem a food organic or not organic, in order to certify and that could be one reason that it costs more to the consumer.  The produce is no better or worse than Food 4 Less but is much more expensive.  I do love their vegan/vegetarian friendly foods and their employees all seem to be very at peace.   ...  ... PS  SHOUT OUT!  White-haired lady who walks around the bulk section sticking your nasty fingers into the bins and eating out of them like a pig....THANK YOU FOR PREVENTING ME FROM EVER BUYING BULK AGAIN!!!!  You are really a filthy person and you KNOW I saw you!  You are old enough to know better and you ought to be ashamed of yourself...you could get a lot of people sick!   ...  ... PSS Yes, I ratted on this individual and the Sprouts team took care of her.  They told me that their policy was to empty each bin full that she stuck her fingers in and then refill them with new product.  I felt that it was the right thing to do but it made me feel even more like that woman was just a horrible inconsiderate wretch...after all waste is a terrible thing.
25	4	0	1	1	Had lunch today here.. oh yeah, big ol' ham and cheese sandwich... It was way better then subways, and Quinoz.. at least the ones near my house anyways.  The shop was nice and clean, a little busy because it was lunchtime, but the workers were on their game and made those sandwiches pretty fast to get me back to work on time. ...  ... They had a special that is crazy.. 2 feet of sandwich, any cold ones for $9.99. So I split the cost and got a whole foot long for like $5. It's not the wimpy ones at other $5 foot long deals.. It was huge, had all the fixings, and I could only eat half of it.. So oh yeah, you know what I'm having for supper... MMMM... Can't Wait! good food, meat and cheese were nice and fresh, they didn't skimp on the toppings... good deal, I'll be back..
25	5	0	1	0	I love this place and maybe I am over hyping it but the mayo/mustard mixture they make is like crack to me.  I need it, I want it, I love it on my number nine!  I get the small peppered pastrami on wheat with no cheese with lettuce, tomato, onion, jalapenos and yes....my crack.  The sandwich was my go-to sandwich when I was losing weight because it only adds up to 360 calories and it filled me up for 3-4hours.  I have stuck to it ever since, so if you like fresh ingredients, tasty tasty ingredients then make your next stop any of the port a sub locations.  I love them all!
25	5	0	3	2	I am addicted to these subs! Great ingredients, tasty fresh bread and the mayo/ mustard mix is the bomb! Meats and cheeses are sliced in front of you, just like at a deli.  ...  ... I have also ordered one of their party subs and it was just as good as when you eat in. Can't go wrong with this place. ...  Anyway, if your looking for a good sandwich this place is quick and will hit the spot every time!
25	5	0	1	0	They say there is nothing new under the sun.  Considering we have lots and lots of sun here in Phoenix, and even more sub shops than days of sunshine, what's one more sub restaurant? ...  ... Well, I have to say that Port of Subs does it best.  They don't waste their time with cute and gimmicky bread flavors.  They only have white, wheat, and sourdough.  And this is real bread, with some texture and flavor, not some lifeless excuse for generic Wonder Bread.  And you can get a 2 foot sub here, which I can have split up for the whole family.  Their staff is so friendly here, that they will cut it into as many slices as you want, which is great for my kids.  The manager at this location is particularly good.  He goes the extra mile to make sure you get your food how you want it, and he makes you feel welcome from the beginning to the end of your experience. ...  ... So you ask, "big deal, they have a 2 foot sub here - what really makes them different?"  All meats and cheeses are sliced to order so you know where it comes from and it's not sitting there drying, oxidizing, and degrading all day while sitting out.  This is a huge difference from other places.  The other huge difference is that their bags of chips are bigger, and their standard drink sizes are bigger than any other sandwich place, not to mention the variety of drinks and chips are superior.
25	3	1	1	0	So today was my first day visiting a Port of Subs; not just this particular location. I must say, the chain impresses me but this location was just "meh." ...  ... Assuming the food is the same at every location is the same, I'll be returning to others. I mean come on, they have sourdough and smoked cheddar. That can NOT be a bad thing. My sandwich was quite tasty as well. I imagine the fresh cut meat helped... or at least gave the illusion of helping! ...  ... As to this one... well, I asked for "the works" on my sub... twice, getting a confused look both times, before I waved my hand in front of the case indicating everything. After this point I was informed that the sandwich maker had "never heard that before." Alright that's not so bad in itself. But my co-worker ordered a chicken salad... and the chicken was immediately stuck in the microwave; then a couple minutes later, he was asked if he wanted it hot or cold. When he said that he would have preferred cold, they pulled another bucket of chicken out only to realize that they store their chicken frozen. So they had to heat the chicken in the microwave even more to make sure it was thawed. ...  ... Like I said though, impressive food, not the most impressive location!
25	4	1	1	1	Never been to Port of Subs, have to say, it's a good little sandwich, I ordered a grilled chicken on sourdough bread. Let me tell you the bread was great! If you have great bread how can the sandwich be bad? We have many choices of places to go to for a fast sub sandwich and I am happy to add Port of Subs to my list.
25	2	0	0	0	Same sandwich, different wrapper.  Subway, Quiznos, Port of Subs, whatever, they are all the same
25	2	0	1	0	I liked this location a couple of years ago but not anymore. Ordered the turkey and roast beef on wheat. It was dry and the beef tasted like bread. The banana peppers tasted like nothing as well. I don't think I'll be going here anymore....
25	4	0	0	0	I Love this place.  So much better than that horrible subway.  I love the sourdough bun and any meat you like.  You might want to double up on the meat though.
25	4	0	0	0	Staff here is very friendly and the place is clean.  The staff is relaxed and fun. Iv only ordered a few things from here...so I can't say their food is amazing.  The 2 or 3 subs I order are great. Close to work. Clean. Fun friendly staff. Tasty food. Easy 4 star review.
25	2	1	0	0	Nope won't be returning.  Pulled up no one in the place.  Not a customer.  Not an employee.  Was it robbed?  Was everyone locked up?  Nope but they might have been partying in the back because they were creepy pleasant when they came out front to wait on me.  Ordered tuna but it could have been chicken cause it sure didn't have any flavor.  Very bland.  Looking forward to sour dough but the bread wasn't good either.  Manager you need to mystery dine.
25	5	2	4	3	I've been a fan of Port of Subs since I moved out here to Phoenix back in 2005.  I love everything about them, and last night was no exception. It was Friday night and I was hungry!!! ...  ... But, of all the port of subs, this ones open nice and late.  9PM during the week!!!  In other port of subs reviews, I have openly complained about the horrible hours that the hold, such as closing early (like 6PM on week nights) and some are closed on sundays....others close at 4PM on Saturdays.  Really? lunch only? you can't do like 7PM?  So this one's my favorite just due to the hours alone. ...  ... I came here with my friend after hitting up a few other places. It's located right next to Lowe's in a little strip mall.  I went with the turkey and pastrami 5 inch sub as I always did, and really enjoyed it.  Staff was friendly, and food was prepared quickly. ...  ... I will be back, and enjoy myself every time I'm here!
25	5	0	0	0	Never had a bad meal here. For a chain store this is by fare the best. Fresh, fast and friendly
25	5	0	0	0	Always a top choice for lunch.  Fresh cut meats and cheese, great toppings, fresh soft bread.
26	3	1	2	1	My husband and I went there for dinner. The menu is pretty decent for your choices. My husband had fish and chips (cod) and I had chicken alfredo. The cod was great, and I don't even like fish. My chicken alfredo was really good, just a little too thick and creamy. So it's good for someone who's really hungry and wants a filling dish. The prices are great, and the service is also. I recommend this place for anyone who's looking for a good meal for a great price. We will be going back for breakfast sometime soon.

26	3	0	0	0	This review is based on the time we went, but if I had to come here again, it would probably be better. But since its the first time I ever came to this restaurant, I'll give it a decent review.  ...  ... Located on Craig and Decatur, next to a discount mall. It's a small restaurant, which is in a decent location. it was early morning that we went, and Sunday for that matter. There was 8 of us, and we were able to get a good seating. It did fill up really fast, which shows that, they are a very recognized place. But knowing that they had guess coming in big crowd, it did show that they had little room to accommodate the guess. In other words, the place was small for the popularity they have.  ...  ... The staff, were nice and very helpful. But when they got busy, it seems like the wait time for service tend to spread out more and it seem like they were under staff. It was kind of hard to get refills, or get attention. I think I finished my food, before I got a refill on my drink. But they did what they can do, in which, I'll give them credit for doing what they can.  ...  ... The food, on the other hand, was great. I had the steak and eggs, which was cooked very well and presented very well I basically inhaled it. We also had the chicken quesadilla for appetizer, which was full of chicken. The wife loved it, but I wasn't fond of the sour cream being in a packet. But the quesadilla was good, I'll give them that.  ...  ... Not fond of the fact that they only had one of those bathroom, just for one person at a time. Mainly end up having to stay in line, just to use a bathroom. Other then that, the place can be better, but the food was great.  ...  ... I would probably recommend this place for the food. Probably go there when its not so busy and that you don't plan to use the bathroom while you're their. Other then that, its an A-OK kind of review. Maybe next time, it will be better.
26	3	0	0	0	First time trying this cafe.  The food was a great value - lots of food and a fair price.  My husband had the pot roast omelet and I had the spinach/mushroom omelet.  The service was lacking.  We sat at one table for 10 minutes but were not even given a menu.  After seeing two other groups come in after us and be waited on before us, we moved to another table...that was better but still coffee was not refilled and we had to flag down a waitress just to get the check.  We would go again but only if we had lots of time and didn't mind sitting around waiting.

26	4	0	0	0	Good breakfast.
26	1	0	3	0	I decided to try this place for lunch. I will definitely not be returning, nor can I recommend it to anyone else. ...  ... The portion size was incredibly small for the price. I could have let that slide if the food had been excellent, but it was not. My "ultimate" sandwich was a dried-out chicken breast with a couple slices of avocado. The french fries were OK, but definitely nothing to rave about. ...  ... The low point came when I had to use the restroom. It looked as if it hadn't been cleaned in a month. There were even dead and dying roaches on the floor. On the way back to my table, I glanced in the kitchen and it looked nearly as dirty as the restroom. I wish I had seen these things before eating -- I would have left before ordering.
26	4	0	1	0	Excellent service and excellent food! Definitely will be going back!  I live in North Las Vegas and there are not too many breakfast joints near my house. I was surprised when I found this "hole in the wall."  It definitely has a cafe look, but is very clean.  It's my understanding the place if family owned, and all the employees were friendly.  The food was fresh, came out in a reasonable time, and tasted delicious.  Chicken fried steak was bomb and eggs benedict was acceptable.  I willl try for dinner or lunch next.
26	2	2	2	0	Your friendly neighborhood cafe...well they were friendly when they finally decided to come around. I have to say, for a small cafe you'd think they were able to maintain the amount of seating in this place. Now I don't know what the deal was, but our server took awhile to greet us and take our order and after we got our food he never came back to check on us??? What the heck?!?! It was just me and my dad eating and we had ordered a simple breakfast. I don't even think my dad got a refill on his coffee. The food is priced fair for the quality of the food. It's nothing like Marilyn's but it's okay. I don't know if I really want to give this place another try, but my uncle seems to like it here, so maybe in the future I will. ...  ... Oh I had to ask for a take out container twice from two different people and I had to ask for the check which our server never brought. The first lady I asked went into the kitchen and would only peep her head out and then go back in...what the heck is that about?
26	2	0	0	0	Ordered the Veggie Burger for take out, and it was really nothing to brag about, the whole presentation was pretty boring. I figured something called the 'Harvest Cafe' who brags about 'fresh ingredients',  would know a thing or two about making a 'vegetarian' burger, but I was wrong. First off, the menu says that it comes with sprouts (which was what I was really looking forward to), but it just ended up coming with iceberg lettuce (which I can't stand Iceberg). Also, the patty was really thin and dry ( I could have just thrown a Morning Star patty in the microwave and got the same results) and the bread was really thick for such a little patty. Even the avocado was dry, if that makes sense. Nothing else on the burger (tomatoes, onions) made it any more flavorful. I would suggest that if you are going to serve a vegetarian burger at your restaurant that you at least try and include the vegetables you promised on your menu, and maybe try to have a little more imagination. But the disappointment sadly doesn't end there. My husband ordered the Harvest Burger, and says that it was also pretty boring, and so were the fries, which were a little too firm. He said he would rather have went to 5 guys or even Denny's. I guess when you open up a restaurant on a street that has dozens of places that serve 'diner food', especially burgers, you get a lot of picky people.  ...  ... Anyhow, this place just didn't stick out for us. It's really nothing special. However, I might give it another shot for breakfast some time.
26	4	0	3	3	Great little breakfast spot. Simple no frills good food at great prices. I love pancakes and I have to say they have phenomenal pancakes! I also like that this place is minutes from my house and right next to one of the best cleaners in the valley.  ...  ... Note of caution the breakfast specials during the weekdays are not the same on the weekends. But during the weekday you get: ... 3 of the best pancakes you ever want to eat ... 2 eggs any style ... 2 bacon or sausage ... $4.99...SOLD!

26	4	0	0	0	9am on a Saturday morning, my 9 year old daughter and I walked into harvest cafe to try out their breakfast. ... The staff was extremely efficient and very accommodating towards my daughters love of bacon, substituting ALL the sides that came with the French toast to ONLY BACON with no issues :) ... I ordered the country steak and over medium eggs, the most perfectly cooked eggs I think I may have ever had in a breakfast establishment, my steak was juicy & crisp, the sausage gravy could of used a little more seasoning. ... Wish they had some more unique menu items, but thinking they cater to the 'older' patrons that were seated in the restaurant. ...  ... We will definitely be back!
26	1	0	0	0	My wife have been there many times. The food just keeps getting worse. We had steaks tonight one was okay but the other was 80% fat and gristle. The part I was able to cut out was was so tough I could not eat it. The salad was old and bitter. There is no pride in there food anymore. We will never go back for lunch or dinner.

30	1	8	8	3	Do you love big sloppy pieces of pork fat covered in barbecue sauce? If so please come here!! ...  ... I'll be as nice as I can since I've only been here once and only had one item.    ...  ... I had open faced pork sandwich with a side of coleslaw.   The pork was sliced thin but was 50% fat. and no, not just one piece of pork but the entire plate of it, yuck! ...  ... They must have forgot to add the dressing to the coleslaw because it was bone dry.  Yummy, I love raw plain cabbage! How did they know? ...  ... I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and say I just got a bad hunk of meat because there is no way this place could serve food like that and stay in business.   ...  ... If they change their name to "My Big Plate of Pork Fat with Sauce" it would better suit the meal I was served. ...  ... ---Re-reading my own review and now I'm pissed that I didn't send it back, I should have damn it!
30	1	1	1	1	I've been here several times, always expecting it to be better than it ever actually is.  I could complain about the prices, but I think my cousin and I simply agree that all BBQ joints are overpriced. ... So I'll complain about the food.  And the service.  I went in the late afternoon and the place was empty.  Our waitress looked sweaty and kinda high.  We missed the lunch menu (which actually only has 2 items) so we both ordered dinners.  My pulled pork was good enough and my okra was milliseconds away from being carbon.  We both inexplicably had to pay extra for the side orders that we chose to go with our meals.  My cousin said the cornbread (an extra 75 cents for no apparent reason) was the best she'd ever had at a restaurant and she enjoyed the hot links but when our bill came to over $30 we both thought that was about $15 too much.  My bbq beans were alright, nothing special.  I wish I had just ordered their "special", seasoned waffle fries topped with pulled bbq, cheese, and jalapenos.   ... Our waitress finished up her performance by adding up our bill incorrectly.   I'm on the fence whether or not to just ban the restaurant from my list of possibilities...I love bbq but ugh.
30	1	1	2	2	Now, being from the Midwest, I LOVE a good hunk of BBQ... and like Mathew, I didn't get that here. My friend and i were running errands and decided we wanted a quick BBQ lunch. The place was empty. We were the only people in the entire place.  ...  ... I have to say, the service was excellent... but it turned out that the guy who waited on us was the older brother of a kid I know, so we may have gotten preferential treatment. I suspect that they are just as attentive to strangers though. The place is very clean and comfortable in a tile meets pleather kind of way, but the food was way below my standards.  ...  ... I spent the whole time picking through the meat to find a few bites that were not filled with fat. It's too bad that they are willing to serve such fatty meat because the sauce and the side dishes were great.  If only the main dish had been as good as the waiter and the rest of the food.
30	4	7	8	8	Now I'm not from Kansas City but I started eating meat again awhile ago and I'm pretty picky about what kind of meat I put in my mouth believe it or not! I havent had a pork sandwich in a few years and I usually hate teh pork!! The way this was cooked, seriously it was not fatty or I never would have polished the whole thing off. I liked it that much! I have no qualms with throwing shitty food in the garbage where it belongs. The taste was really good with just the right smokey flavor the meat was tender and not dry. I was so full I didnt even touch my sides so I cant say anything about the fries, onion rings, or slaw. It was a bit pricey but this totally hit the spot for me the other night....that is all!
30	4	6	11	9	There's a huge banner out front proclaiming : ... " UNDER NEW MANAGEMENT ... THE OLD OWNERS ARE BACK" ... , but I didn't ask "for how long?", so can't say how that pertains to the less than stellar reviews showing up here. ...  ... I got solid 4 star food and service. ...  ... I definitely recommend choosing "Burnt Ends" as your meat! ... It is a mix of pork and beef brisket, but cut into hunks instead of shredded.  It's not burnt as the clever name implies, but the chunks give you plenty of crusty "BARK" full of smoky flavor.   My usual habit of mixing the sweet and hot sauces being offered worked out perfectly. ...  ... The amount of fat in the meat was absolutely appropriate, unlike other reviewers have said.  It's needed for flavor, tenderness, and juiciness, which my sammich had all three of. ...  ... If I went for BBQ and got 100% lean meat, I'd complain!!!! ...  ... On a bizarre note, their fries were the exact taste and consistency of McDonald's fries!  Maybe a good thing to some people, maybe even great to some, but if they're not going to be the thick homecut wedges I'd prefer, then I'd say they should aim more for Wendy's fries 8^ ) ...  ... Service was great.  The decor was clean and full of stylized jazz musician paintings and sculptures. ...  ... My only gripe is that I hate menus with rules, and this one was interspersed with the classic "No Substitutions" for the lunch special, and a few others.  No biggie, i understand they need to try to control some costs, and i'll be back regardless.
30	2	1	1	2	The last time I went I was sooo happy with the food now I'm sooo sad. The day before New Yrs Eve I was craving some good BBQ. I promised myself no more meat except fish starting New Years. So this was pretty much my last hoorah. I was looking forward to it ALL day!! I had a burnt ends sandwich with fries and onion rings. Well I couldn't even finish the sandwich! It was dry and tough and tasted pretty salty. About half way through my stomach started crying for help. I felt like dude on Man Vs. Food I was determined to eat it but it turned awful. I had to stop eating and I thought I was going to die. I had a gallon of tea after that and luckily pulled through alive. Not at all like last time. NOT ONE BIT!! Oh fries were not good either not like McD's they were pretty greasy more like Two Hippies but without the thickness. Onion rings were ok  meh nothing to write about. ...  ... Still sad about the whole thing!
30	1	0	0	0	We were hoping to find some good BBQ here, but this was a big disappointment.  We got take out, beef brisket and pulled pork, a side of fried okra and side of coleslaw.   The staff was pleasant enough.  The coleslaw was pretty good, almost good enough to make me bump this review up a star.  The okra was nothing special, but probably didn't benefit from the few minutes in transit between frying and eating. ...  ... But the beef and the pork were a huge disappointment.  For one thing, it was hard to tell which was which(!)  Both were sliced extremely thin like they had been cut on a deli slicer.  I seriously doubt the beef was brisket, as it was dry and lean.  Very little smoke flavor to the meat, and the sauce was lacking in flavor with an oddly metallic note to it. ...  ... I hate to give a one star rating but BBQ is all about the meat, and the meat was ... just not good.  I don't know, maybe this was a fluke given that not all the reviews here are negative.  But I don't think there's any way we're trying them again.
30	4	3	9	6	Old owners are back and by that I mean the original owners from back when they occupied the Chino's building.  ...  ... Lunch here with Ryan C proved to be most excellent. I had the pulled pork large size not the smaller lunch size. They serve it with frys and pickle slices.  ...  ... The sesame studded bun was large enough and dense enough to hold in the mound of meaty goodness. No fat in this one folks. The frys were forgettable and the pickles had bite.  ...  ... The sauce I used was the spicy and it was perfect. More of a KS style, ketchup based sauce. The service was attentive but slow as they had a server call in sick. I would rather have slow service then a sick server any day.  ...  ... The guy next to us said he drives from Sun City just to eat here. That means he passes El Paso, Thee Pits, Shanes RibShack Just to get here.  ...  ... I tried a bite of the burnt ends... I love it. More like a tougher chunk not a pulled type but man there was a ton of flavor. I burped the smoke at dinner. YEAAHH!!  ...  ... Price was good, place was clean and people seemed happy.
30	4	0	1	1	Best bar-b-q in north Phoenix for sure.
30	1	0	3	0	I just moved here from Kansas and have been looking for a good BBQ joint.  We ordered the lunch special, which was a choice of a beef or pork sandwich with coleslaw and fries. We also got an order of rib tips. The food took forever, and there were only two other couples there. The  sandwich was tiny and served on a regular hamburger bun. The fries were average, and the coleslaw had zero flavor. The rib tips were cold inside. When I told the waitress, she apologized and said that they come frozen. She said that they get steamed before coming out.  I couldn't believe that a BBQ restaurant would have frozen meat. WTH?  This place was so disappointing.  I will not be coming back.
30	2	0	3	0	Came here with friends to satisfy a bbq craving.  When we walked in there was only one other customer with her baby but we didn't think much of it because it was a holiday and most businesses were dead. ...  ... They didn't have much selection but I went with the bbq chicken sandwich, and my friends got the beef ribs and brisket.  Nothing was fantastic.   ...  ... My bbq chicken sandwich was dry... I had to pour on bbq sauce.  I guess they forgot that it was a BBQ sandwich.  My friends ribs were unsatisfactory... mainly just a big bone with lots of fat.  She tried her best to get good meat off of it but it was scarce.  The brisket was not what I think of when I think of brisket.  I think of tender meat that melts in your mouth.... this just looked like roast beef on a plate.   ...  ... I got a side order of cornbread but it was so dry that I couldn't get much of it down :(  So sad because I looooove cornbread. ...  ... We also got dessert- peach cobbler.  Tasted more like apple crisp which really confused my pallet.... but I guess I wasn't expecting much at this point. ...  ... I'll be looking for other bbq restaurants to fulfill any future bbq cravings because this place just didn't do it for me.
30	4	0	0	0	There are two places in Phoenix that have the BEST barbecue sauce.  Honey Bears is the "Not sweet" one, LoveJoys is the "Sweet" one.  Love them both.
30	4	0	0	0	Boy, am I ever glad we showed up AFTER the new management took over. Looking at past reviews is saddening considering the fantastic experience my family had at Lovejoy's.  ...  ... Ours was a totally impromptu visit. We were out car shopping when the kids started in with the "I'm STARVING" proclamations from the backseat. When we are out and about, my husband and I always try to find new places to eat, so when I spotted Lovejoy's we didn't hesitate to check it out. ...  ... The waitress was very friendly and helpful. The food was incredible. We got the Family Feast and the four of us each chose a side. Potato salad, corn bread, BBQ beans and french fries (fries were chosen by our 7 year old. lol) ...  ... The meat was melt-in-your-mouth tender. The sides were all very good as well. Even my 7 year old, who may quite possibly be the pickiest person on the entire planet, proclaimed the food as being "delicious"! ...  ... We thought the price was more than fair and we took home leftovers that lasted for two more meals!! ...  ... Last, but not least, the sauces were very very good! We will definitely be going back for more!

30	2	0	0	0	I had been wanting to have barbeque for awhile. This was the only place that was close to me. I had read the bad to average reviews, but still decided to give it a shot.  That was a mistake. There was no other customers inside and the food was incredibly bland.  ...  ... I decided to go with the 2 meat dinner combo. It ran just under $15. I went with pork ribs and sausage. For my sides I had Mac & Cheese and baked beans. The thing that had the most taste was was the baked beans and they tasted like they came straight from a can.   ...  ... I would not recommend going here to anyone. I personally will not be going back.
30	4	0	1	0	Really good food!!!! I'm so stuffed! Excellent service, the pork sandwiches we had were terrific & very BIG.Their sauce is good too. We'll definitely be back.
30	3	0	1	0	Tried a bbq beef sandwich here on way home from a mornin meeting.  It was tasty, but nothing to make me jump up and down.   I was actually hoping for a better bbq sauce flavor more reminiscent of bbq I have had in KC.   ...  ... I will try here again because it does seem like a genuine home style bbq joint.  I should probably have tried a plate deal.
30	1	0	1	0	Had the brisket and the bbq beef sandwich + sides.  Everything was no good.  The meat was dry the sides were bland.  If you're looking for good BBQ in the Phoenix area I recommend Honey Bears or Bobby Q's.
31	5	0	1	0	I purchased a 2003 VW GTI for $1000 less than the "private party value". They picked me up from the airport for free and pointed out an error I made when counting out the cash to pay for the car. (I would have paid them $500 more and never known it). I hate used car dealers and sales people in general, but I'll be buying my next car here too. 100% positive feedback on ebay is acurate when it comes to this business. I'm still driving the car and I still love it.
31	1	0	1	0	This guy has a lot of good vehicles cheaper than most dealers and private parties however my experience with him was TERRIBLE. I live up north in Cave Creek and he had a car I really liked so I called him to setup an appointment to see it and test drive it. He was VERY reluctant to let me test drive it and VERY demanding of immediate cash (he repeated this to me about 5 times). Anyway I managed to convince him to let me test drive the car without actually handing him a large sum of cash. So I venture down 30+ minutes in Phoenix traffic and am able to look at the car but when I go to ask to test drive it.. NO! Again he was going on and on about having cash in hand up front before i can even drive the car. Now i respect why he is doing that.. however.. who on EARTH wants to pay for something without testing/using it? Maybe it's me.. but I see a vehicle, especially one that I'm going to pay $6,000 or more on an investment. ...  ... So if you are the type who loves just randomly giving money away for something without using it or verifying it suits your needs.. feel free to give this guy a call.. he has plenty of good deals.. but if your like me and want to ensure you know what your getting.. look elsewhere.

31	1	0	1	0	NO STARS FOR THIS FRAUDULENT USED CAR SALESMAN! The 2000 Porsche 911 996 I bought from Alan Monroe in February 2014 is NOT AS ADVERTISED! It is not a SAFE DAILY DRIVER as Alan Monroe personally assured me before I ever submitted final payment. With 72 hours of receiving the car in California, I asked and he agreed to take the vehicle back. When I reported that I had made transportation arrangements, he reneged. The following day he requested I have the vehicle professionally inspected by a certified Porsche mechanic. He said he would consider covering costs of necessary repairs.  When estimate came in at more than the purchase price of the vehicle, including a new transmission! ($16,000.00+), he offered $1,500.00. Now working with State Atty General Fraud Division, DMV, eBay, BBB, and have filed complaint against him to take him to court. Alan Monroe of Arizona Wholesale Auto & Truck sold a LEMON to a buyer in California and the car will not CA State inspection! BUYERS BEWARE!!!!

Don't get me wrong, there is nothing spectacular about the place, but the prices are actually affordable, which is a rare jewel in the tourist areas of Las Vegas.  I stopped here for food twice on my trip, once for breakfast, and again for the pizza buffet, and was glad I found such an affordable place close to my hotel.  I even stopped by the Subway at the Circus Circus and couldn't believe they wanted $10 for a footlong.  This place is a must for a budget minded traveler staying at the Stratosphere.  The omelet was decent sized, and the pizza buffet had huge amounts of salad and pasta as well.  I only wish that the Casino section of the establishment had some low stakes table games as well.  I would certainly have preferred to hand a small operation like this my money as opposed to the big casinos.
32	4	5	8	5	Awesome INEXPENSIVE Pizza-Salad-Pasta Buffet! ...  ... SITREP ...  ... There is NOTHING Spectacular about this location (across the street from the Stratosphere) nor it's menu (QUITE ordinary).  And though that does not sound like a stellar-recommendation for someone to "go-out-of-their-way to come to", it IS what it IS, and if you are close by and hungry, this is a stop definitely worth poppin for.  ...  ... SETUP ...  ... As a guest in the Stratosphere, I first noticed Aztec Inn when I was walking to the Circle K (and I should review this Circle K, cause IT is very cool too), and saw that they had a $6.95 all you can eat Pizza Buffet.   I pay this when I do the pizza buffets at Roundtable and Mountain Mike's back in Sacramento. ...  ... THE MENU ...  ... This buffet was so much better with: ...  ... *  A big selection of pizza slices (including a substantial amount of veggies & pesto based-sauces); ... *  A big selection of leafy greens, lots of different salad toppings and options; ... *  A pasta bar with a couple of different selections, usually one with a meat sauce, and then another with a marinara or an alfredo-based sauce; and, ... *  The bottomless soda was also a great plus.   ...  ... Being in the casino also allowed many patrons to take advantage of the FULL bar nearby which was it's own separate cost (but usually spirits beyond normal beer & wine are available in most pizza establishments, and sometimes not even the beer & wine). ...  ... THE LOWDOWN ...  ... Sure, it's very quaint, not at all elegant, but if you're trying to mind your money, and don't want to get stuck putting out $50-$70 for a buffet wristband on the strip that will anchor you to only a handful of food & diversity options for three days, then these little out of the way places are true gems to enjoy.
32	4	0	1	0	For a little seedy place next to the stratosphere hotel, the food here is VERY good. My girlfriend got the chicken with mixed veggies and I got the Philly cheese steak which was really good. A great meal for around $30 and enough food for breakfast before we roll out of Vegas. We thoroughly enjoyed. Don't let the exterior of this place fool you. The food is great.
32	4	0	1	0	ok so I walked here because of the reviews in regards to the pizza buffet....I was sad when the waitress told me they don't do that anymore and it's now Thai with some American food. I was starving so I settled for the Philly Cheese Steak. ...  ... OMG!!! very good and a heaping stack of amazing French fries. pleasantly surprised that I can have all this in Vegas for about $8.
32	1	7	7	5	Sometimes you hit magic. You know what I mean, that hole-in-the-wall joint that where you would never think to walk in the door, but somehow (for whatever reason), you go in that door, order some food, and you experience some of  the most amazing food that you've had in a long time.. e.g. Rollin' Smoke BBQ, Fat Choy etc... ...  ... OK, this is not one of those places. ...  ... This review is for the Asian/American cafe that is located inside of the casino. I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but sometimes, it just needs to happen (if you don't believe me, go in this place and check it out). ...  ... I personally thought that we have moved past this type of food. Maybe like 20 years ago this might have been accepted as mediocre food, but now, I,Don't, Think, So! ...  ... I was thinking about giving this place 2 stars because the cashier lady was so friendly. And, she seemed genuinely concerned about making sure that I was alright. But, the food was speaking loudly too me, it was actually SHOUTING at me! So, here we go... ...  ... 5$ Pho: Ok, lets talk about the broth. I'm talking Top Ramen here peeps. Like, water + powdered soup base. That's it. Mental picture here. Noodles: Pad Thai noodles. It looks like they weren't soaked and cooked properly, or possibly they were old because they had that slight woody taste.. The rare beef? Overcooked, well done (meaning past medium)  thick slices of flavorless beef. Finally, cilantro on top. That's all folks. Plus, i've had a tender stomach last night and the whole day today. ...  ... The owners seemed very nice so it pains me to do this. But I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. I've been very fortunate to hit a lot of bullseye's in my foodie quest in Vegas. I've also hit some ducks along the way. Quack muthatruckin' Quack!
33	5	1	4	2	Best Sushi East of Los Angeles: Being a Los Angeles native, and an avid sushi eater for over 17years, I figured that by moving by to the desert I would have to settle for mediocre sushi. I was wrong. Sushi Ave. is on par, if not better in some ways (price, friendliness), with the best sushi bars in Los Angeles. Sushi Chef James serves up a wonderful array of house specials and traditional sushi dishes that will have you hooked. Highly Recommended!
33	3	0	3	2	No one can top fresh just caught sushi, served up on the sea wall in Okinawa with a bottle of Kirin.  HOWEVER, Sushi Ave is pretty close.  Smaller scale than most, cozy.  Great selection.
33	5	1	7	4	This place is just awesome. I keep going back because nothing beats it. The place is very unassuming, being sandwiched between a bank and a Checker Auto Parts. It's easy to pass it by but don't let the strip mall fool you, they have EXCELLENT fish and service. The interior is chic and modern. Sit at the large sushi bar and get the full experience.  ...  ... The albacore tuna tataki melts in the mouth & has a delectable sauce on top. They also have a wide array of house specialty rolls.The ultimate spicy tuna roll is nothing short of amazing. It has spicy tuna on the inside with asparagus (which gives it a nice texture and light crunch) and tuna on the outside. I've taken so many out-of-town guests from California and they've all been just as pleased. ...  ... They have a nice assortment of awards on the walls, and it's no surprise why.
33	5	0	4	1	Sushi Ave is within a mile of my house and I have probably driven past it a thousand times, I do not know why we have not tried this hidden gem sooner, maybe it was their location in a strip mall with a Checker Auto parts and a veterinary clinic. I'll admit I am not as adventurous when it comes to sushi places as I should be but the cooked stuff tasted really good. We tries their California roils, Spicy Crab rolls, Las Vegas Roll and some sort of "volcano" dish (All I know is they lit it on fire at the table, COOL!). This place is awesome.
33	4	0	1	1	Really great sushi. I'm an avid sushi lover from LA and didn't expect to find great sushi all the way out here but it was really great and the sushi chef was extremely friendly.
33	4	0	4	3	We have been looking for a good sushi joint close by that is good and not to pricey. I always saw this place but never tried it but saw reviews for its and decided to give it a try. It was great, the best I have had so far. They had a great Hawaiian roll of some sort that was awesome. We basically had a few of their various rolls since we are just beginners at Sushi. We are not hardcore like some but this place did its job and hit the spot. I like the quaint atmosphere and really nice wait staff. It was really dark inside which took a bit for my eyes to get use to :) But all around I loved it.
33	5	1	3	1	This is my favorite spot for sushi in the valley. I think I've tried almost every roll here and have not been disappointed. The menu includes pictures, which I always love when picking out some fun options. They set the Volcano roll on fire and it just melts in your mouth. The Las Vegas and New York rolls are also good. The Hawaiian roll in good, the Spider (Crab) roll, I could go on and on. There are so many great choices. The staff here is also super friendly.  ...  ... I'm getting hungry just thinking about this place. Just got to get the boyfriend to like sushi. I made him try the really good stuff in NYC and he hasn't been the same ever since.   :p
33	3	0	1	0	Really a 3.5 rating.  Went on friday night and it  was about half full.  girlfriend and i sat at the bar.  ...  ... cons: 1. somehow they messed up our order and gave it to someone next to us, who ordered after us.  they figured it out and gave it  back to us   2.  I had to ask for ginger, which is pretty lame, and then they only gave us one btwn the two of us.  the ginger is also unusually sweet, as they marinate it a second time.  i just like the original, white, uncolored ginger.  3.  Ordered the pink lady roll, and i am still trying to figure out what the pink stuff on the outside of it ...  ... pros:  double spicy roll (spicy tuna inside and out), new york roll (spicy salmon and other stuff that is whole roll tempura fried), and salmon nigiri.  Salmon was awesome!  fatty, perfectly cut, and not old and dry.  the rolls aren't loaded with rice that make you feel stuffed and take away from flavor. ...  ... definitely i will go back to see how it goes a second time.  japanese gf made a good point that almost every roll has imitation crab which makes it lower quality and makes rolls look bigger.
33	4	0	2	1	Wow great place to eat just came home from dinner.  I've been meaning to try this place for a couple of months now, and finally decided to check it with a friend.  Good atmosphere not noisy at all and a great place for good sushi and a good talk.  Fish quality was good and service was excellent.  Will definitely be back to try the different rolls. ...  ... Had the New York, Volcano, and Red Spider alll very tasty
33	4	1	3	4	One of our favorite local sushi places. Good quality and selection, and not very expensive. We usually get sushi for takeout, and they've never had an order wrong (knock on wood).
33	4	0	2	1	I had never tried sushi until I moved to the Valley 3 years ago. I since have become a huge fan. This very restaurant played a huge role in this. Every time I eat there I get about 5 rolls for my girlfriend and I to share. It fills you up and it doesn't break the bank in the process. The atmosphere is very nice as well, dark modern furnishings throughout. The owners are so nice there as well, welcoming each customer with a genuine smile and greeting. Overall: Great place to grab some sushi.
33	4	0	1	0	I like this place. It's close to home, has a great atmosphere, and good sushi. ...  ... If the sushi was better, we would be in heaven and would eat there way too much.  ...  ... However, the sushi is good. Not great. We could eat there an be satisfied, but never really go "wow, this is good." ...  ... Know what I mean?
33	4	0	3	0	I regularly go to this place for lunch with a group of co-workers. We usually get there around 11:30 a.m.  I am always amazed that this location is never busy.  ...  ... This is one of my favorite locations in town. I can't say that I have ever had bad food during my visits.  ...  ... Again, today, 5 of the guys went in for lunch. Ordered seveal orders of sashimi, nigiri, and about 6 rolls.  All tasted very good.  We were also served two complimentary orders of pot stickers.  I pretty sure because of the slow service.  ...  ... My favorite is the Hawaian Role and Samurai Roll.  The Jalapeno Role is also good.  ...  ... My only complaint was that the food prep was a little slow. There was only one sushi chef and she clearly had a hard time keeping up with order. Now, I can understand if the place was packed, but when you are the only group in the restaurant, I would think the roles would come flying out!!!  Getting there at 11:00 a.m. we did not get out until almost 12:30 p.m.  A little too long for the only group in the place.  ...  ... Reading prior reviews, I learned that the place is under new management.  And it was a different chef behind the bar than the person from previous visit.  So maybe we are still developing skills.  ...  ... Will continue to visit. Food has always been good regardless owner.  Don't always want to spend 1 1/2 hour for lunch. ...  ... Would be 5 Stars.  But due to slower service today, taking away one star...
33	5	0	0	0	Saw positive reviews for Sushi Avenue and decided to stop by and try Sushi Avenue.  The employees there are very nice and care about their customers.  The Food is the best!!  I had Octapus and fresh water eel sushi as well as their Teryaki Chicken plate.  I would deffinetly suggest going.
33	3	0	0	0	This place was good, but just good. Happy hour sucks bad and the sushi rolls could be bigger for the price you are paying but over all the sushi was very good .
33	4	0	0	0	This is a great place for both traditional sushi and unique fusion roles. ...  ... I don't quite understand why this place is hardly ever busy - I can only figure it's the location that fails to draw a crowd.  The food is great and the chefs and wait staff are always super friendly.   Prices are about average and they have recently incorporated some great lunch combos.
33	4	0	0	0	I have been a customer of Sushi Ave for some time, I was upset that my friend sold the place and moved away. I was glad to see that most of the menu is still the same but the quality did fall at first.  I have been back a few times and the new owners are starting to win me over.  Some rolls are just about as I remember them but, some of the more specialty rolls that I  loved are not there yet. One of the things I do like that has not changed is the rolls are rolled smaller, not hard to eat, kind of bite sized.  The rolls are longer so you are not cheated and it makes it easier to eat  ...  ... Over all this is still my favorite place to go in the East Valley. Try the Arizona roll, it's not as good as it used to be but still very tasty.   ...  ... We miss you James
33	5	0	4	2	I think what I like most of all about Sushi Ave is Harry and Nana. They have made my experiences so pleasant. Every time Travis and I go to Sushi Ave Nana makes us something special (from her secret menu) and it's ALWAYS delicious! She is working on a secret menu to offer on their Yelp page and I am so excited for it, because everything she gives us is AMAZING! ...  ... Their sushi rolls are full of flavor, never have they been soggy, the Vegas roll is SOO good!!! Warm, with a light crisp texture and eel sauce...mmmMmm! ...  ... Come, try it out, it really is as good as it gets!!
33	4	0	0	0	Good sushi.  Not as good ad RA but no wait.  Last time we were there the service could have been a little better, but the food is always great.
33	5	0	1	0	I have nothing bad to say about Sushi Ave. Nana and Harry the owners are as nice as can be. ...  ... The sushi is amazing, it is always fresh, prepared well and frankly just tasty. ...  ... They are not condescending like many other sushi hipster places.  ...  ... Probably the best sushi in the East Valley. ...  ... Oh ya their Vegas Roll is done right.
33	3	0	0	0	Was my first time eating here. Have to say I was pretty satisfied. Sake actually lasted me through my whole beer, compared to ra.  All the rolls I had were delicious. Only thing that was sub par was the tightness of the rolls, but since im a ninja with the chopsticks, it wasn't a problem.
33	2	0	0	0	If you are looking for freshly rolled Sushi and can't make it out of the East Valley, this place might work.  Small dive kind of place next to a Auto Parts Store and Veterinarian Office. ...  ... The rolls were a step above store bought and the atmosphere was dark and cold.  Not the social meeting place found at the Sushi Bars I am use to in Ventura CA. ...  ... I've visited twice.  The most recent night my fiance and I visited there was a table of about 8 regulars right in the middle of the confined bar who were loud and obnoxious and ruined our dining experience. ...  ... Not impressed.
33	4	0	0	0	Just went here for lunch and tried the bento boxes and a couple of the specialty rolls.  Everything was very good.  The teriyaki beef was better than most I've tried. ...  ... Also, the decor was a perfect mix of dark wood, Japanese accents, and modern feel.  Will definitely be back, perhaps to try out the happy hour.
33	1	1	4	1	I've been twice now and this place ranks with Ra as being top nasty sushi place. People that rate a place on rolls should not comment on "freshness". Rolls are for people that eat sushi to be cool. Eat the sashimi and then rate. Anyways, had the large sashimi plate. Fish was warm, not on ice and the albacore about made be puke. It's easy to dress up bad fish with rice and sauces but not sashimi. Fish was glossy and opaque......... Never again!!
33	4	0	0	0	Pro - FRESH, sushi is delicous, service is good.  You get to store your own chopsticks-  catchy.  Hopefully nobody licks them while your away.  ...  ... Con - Nit picky but the bottom of the chairs need those soft thingys.  Everytime some sits - SCREEEEECH.    ...  ... The weird stuff in the jars are not all that.  Wont do that again.  ...  ... The lobster roll was awesome.
33	4	0	0	0	Happy hour is fun!  I really like the chef there.  He is very sweet and welcoming.
33	5	0	0	2	Best sushi in Gilbert. The PHX roll is my favorite. Nana and Harry always provide great sushi at great prices. Its a nice place that isn't loud and pretentious like other chain sushi places.... ...  ... And their dumplings are to die for.
33	5	0	1	0	First look and you think augh how good can this place be after all it's next to an auto parts store.  Well let me tell you it is bar far the best Sushi.  I visit RA a lot because my friend live close by, but then I found Sushi Ave. on a dining reward program and I don't go anywhere else!!  They are attentive, the sushi is FRESH, the plum sangria is amazing, the price is very good compared to how much food you get.  Well worth the visit!!!  If you go often you also get your own set of chop stix which they clean and store up front for the next time you come.  LOVE LOVE LOVE Sushi Ave.!!!!  The only negative thing I might say is the chairs make a horrible noise scraping on the floor every time you move.
33	2	0	0	0	Everytime I've eaten there the service is terrible! They have a huge turnover of servers. The sushi is poor quality. The owner/sushi chefs are rude. I don't want to return after so many bad experiences.
33	5	0	0	0	I chose the Double Spicy Roll & Ultimate Dragon Roll.  Amazing!!!  You pay what is normal for great sushi.  When it's this good, I do not care what it costs.  They have lunch sushi specials and Happy Hour sushi specials for those who want to save some dough.  The owners are very nice.  I will be going back again, and again.
33	4	1	4	1	Another Sushi place that is owned by Koreans lol. The staff including the waitress and sushi chef were nice and service was good. But it was quite empty that day (just two tables including ours) so maybe that was the reason. Anyways, ordered salmon and scallop nigiri which were both good. The fish tasted fresh. No complaints here! ...  ... Then ordered some rolls: spicy roll (forgot name), rainbow, caterpillar, and alaskan. Again, the fish were fresh, but I gotta say, I wasn't a big fan of the alakan roll. Originally, I thought the lemon on it would add a nice zing, but It kinda overpowered everything. On the other hand, I would recommend the rainbow and caterpillar roll if you like a bunch of sushi and eel. (eel cause=bomb).  ...  ... Now on to my rant of this place. I guess it's not meant to be a negative but just a warning to those with bigger or hungry stomachs. This place has the TINIEST rolls ever. I swear the pictures of rolls on the menu are the actual size of the rolls. You eat one and you don't even feel it sitting in your stomach. I actually asked the waitress which of the rolls were the biggest. lol  ...  ... So yea, there you have it. It's a nice sushi place with fresh fish and good staff, but if you want value and bigger portions, I would look else where.
33	1	2	1	0	Would give 0 stars. Ordered over the phone after viewing website and menu. Strike one when I order ahead of time and go to a restaurant to pick up my order and it's not done. Strike 2 when I checked my bag to leave and all of my food was not in the bag. Strike 3, the plates we ordered were disgusting.  ...  ... The spicy tuna we ordered wasn't spicy, and really fishy tasting. Our squid salad also left very much to be desired and was extremely rubbery. I've had better squid salad for a fraction of the price at Teharu (the conveyor belt sushi place). It makes me wonder if they're just cooking up dead animals from the veterinarian's office next door.... The food was seriously that disgusting, I wouldn't be surprised.
33	5	0	1	0	Best sushi place in Gilbert. ...  ... yes even over Otaku and Blue Wasabi
33	1	0	3	0	Place sucks. Took my order to go and saw the steamed rice looked old and yellow. Never going back to this place.
33	5	0	2	0	Best Sushi bar in East Valley. Owner seems very knowledgeable and makes special ... sauce.  we ordered 2 rolls, chicken teriyaki and Tuna Salad. Everything was so fresh and delicious.
33	2	1	2	1	This place changed owners a couple of years ago. I went a couple of times after the owner change. The decor changed a little. Service was friendly but honestly everything was not nearly as good. I was pretty disappointed. Rice was too warm, rolls were falling apart & not the same, sashimi was not that good. I never came back. Oh well, it was great while it lasted.
33	4	0	0	1	Great little place in an out of the way shopping area. Easy to get in and out if your on lunch break. Nice lunch specials and don't forget the FREE appetizer deal here on Yelp! Fresh sushi, fast and friendly staff. A solid choice.
33	4	0	4	0	So, I have to be honest and say that I wasn't exactly stoked to eat at this place.  It shares a building with an automotive supply store and I thought for sure that I'd be losing my dinner faster than I ate it.  My husband suggested it because our usual spot had closed down and I was craving sushi.  "Let's go to Sushi Ave" was a phrase I was positive that I would regret... ...  ... SURPRISE!  This place is great.  The first time we went we had amazing service and the food was good.  The second time we went, the service was amazing and the food was delicious.  I think that my only gripe would be that the rolls are huge and I had to google the appropriate way to eat large pieces; it's all or nothing, btw.  My favorite treat was at the end of the meal when they brought 1/2 an orange drizzled with chocolate and whipped cream.  Ugh, I'm hungry again... ...  ... Sushi Ave is our new fav sushi place and I am so happy about that.
33	5	0	1	0	This is a excellent place.  I just went last night for Happy hour.  The happy hour menu was excellent.  The place must be a hidden gem very few patrons.   I think people are missing out best sushi place ever!  Excellent service and I will be returning!  Try the Pink lady, Tootsie roll, Ultimate CA roll and Las Vegas roll.  If you like dessert try the mouchi ice cream.
33	5	0	0	0	The first time I went to Sushi Ave, probably over a year ago now, the food was decent but the service, while polite, was very slow. Today, though, things are much different. First of all, the food has gone from decent to flippin' AWESOME! Can you say flavor? You might get bigger pieces of fish at other places, but the sushi here is excellently chilled (warm raw sushi freaks me out a little) and full of flavor. Unlike many sushi places in the Mesa area, they really have an excellent flavor to their rice, so you end up enjoying it rather than viewing it as filler to go with your fish.  ...  ... And that is as far as the food goes. THe service here has improved greatly, too - plus, the staff are super friendly, so if things do get a little slow, all you have to do is flag the waitress down and check on your order. That doesn't happen often, though - no more than the average business. The decor of the place has also improved - so, yeah, that might be a little silly, but the ambience of a place does make a great difference. My first time there, it was just green walls, black tables, no frills, nothing. And if you went into the bathroom, you were blinded by this hiddeous flourescent orange color that blinded you. Bathroom has been redone, they have adorable lanterns and parisols up on the walls overall, a great little place. ...  ... My only word of caution is that the place honestly isn't that big. They do have a large table they set up and separate from the room with a screen if you have a bigger group, but if you have more than eight people.... it might be a tad crowded. This place is slighly on the cozy side. Not bad , though. ...  ... Go for the Chirashi bowl!! it's delicious!! As are the Hawaiian roll and the volcano!
33	5	0	0	0	This is easily the best sushi I've found out here. My wife and I frequently visit and are never disappointed. The service is excellent and the sushi is well-prepared and tastes great! You really can't go wrong here.
33	4	1	1	1	This place was really great! The staff was super friendly and the sushi was phenomenal, the prices were also very good!
33	5	0	0	0	Great prices, yummy sushi. I love their California crunch roll with eel sauce and their Hawaiian chicken.
33	4	0	2	0	Hit up Sushi Ave on a Sat night, I lucked out and got the parking spot right in front! As soon as we walked in my wife and I were greeted by a server. She sat us at a table right int he middle along the wall. The place wasn't packed, but not empty, just the right amount of folks to instill confidence that this was a good place. By the time we were done with our meal, 3-4 parties had been seated. They had a TV on which had college football on, yes! ...  ... The menu is pretty big, filled with many specialty rolls they have created. I tried the ASU Roll, Crunchy California, Shrimp Tempura, and Super Philly. All were good. The ASU Roll is similar to the Arizona Roll at House Modern Sushi, spicy sauce, and a jalepeno on top. It wasn't that hot flavor wise (maybe my headcold had something to do w/ that). The Super Philly is close to what they serve at Orient on Elliot, I added my own sriracha to it to up the flavor. My wife is pregnant so she had most of the cali and shrimp tempura roll, she had been craving some sushi and left me to eat the rolls w/ uncooked fish. ...  ... Got edamame, came out nice and hot, not one cold bean and just the right amount of salt on top. I had some hot tea, it was okay, not sure what the blend was but something green.  ...  ... Service was attentive, got refills without having to flag someone down, and the food was brought out quickly after ordering since we beat the rush. With our bill, we also got an orange cut in half w/ some whipped cream and chocolate syrup, with two toothpicks to cleanse the palate. Enjoy when places do that, not all of them do. The owners (what I believe to be the owners) said "thank you!" loudly when we got up after eating. Glad to see we're noticed and they seemed to care about our business. ...  ... Loved the music here - they were playing some cover songs of modern pop tracks which was fun. ...  ... Will definitely be back since its pretty close to home.
33	4	0	0	0	The rolls are good, but they have a hard time getting your order right when you call in for carry out. I always order the same thing and they continually get it wrong to the point that I have started to just get different items because I know they will give me a "spicy salmon roll when I asked for a spicy salmon bowl"  ... Over all they are good just don't call in
33	4	1	0	0	This place is so good I often come here just too get away from my Girl Friend who I hate so much .  ...  ... One day me and her had a huge argument and she said if you don't get me an engagement ring WE ARE DONE !  ...  ... 20 min I Instagram her a picture of my self at sushi ave . enjoying some creamy Cali rolls :)
33	4	0	0	0	Really awesome sushi with a cool thing they have going on there. We enjoy this place greatly and will come back I'm sure many times! Great wife selection of sushi!
33	2	0	1	0	Sushi was mediocre. I do like their variety. Service was great. I just wish they'd work on one thing... My experience there was okay for my first time and the moment you step in to wash up its a nasty disappointment. I am huge on cleanliness and a restaurant should always have a clean restroom. If they can't maintain that for their customers and staff what's it to say about their kitchen? Just a thought. Not sure I'll ever go back. If they'd fix that issue it'd be a perfect little local spot.
33	2	0	0	0	Was craving sushi and wanted to try a new place.  It was average.. nothing special.  It's a bit pricey too for the quality.  Happy hour seems to have some decent prices though.  I ordered a beef tataki which is normally raw beef... we got some cooked up korean bbq pieces which threw me off, don't get me wrong it was good.  The sashimi: salmon & ono (white tuna) two cuts that are usually melt in your mouth perfection.. kinda chewy? Dragon roll is at most average.  Spent too much for what I got.
33	4	0	0	0	This really could have been a 5star and I will go back to give it a chance. Great food. I went at 5:20 on a Friday Eve which was perfect timing. Within 20 minutes, place was full. They had a happy hour menu with great priced rolls. I also got a special roll. The happy hour rolls were fabulous! The special roll was good. I got teriyaki chicken for the kids. This dish was good. They missed out on 5 stars because of wait times. They are hiring. Also, I had requested two refills for sodas but was brought one. "The other still has soda" which was odd. Great food, great price. Will try a different special next time.
33	2	0	0	0	We decided to give this place a shot because they have a good looking happy hour, and it's very close to our home. My sister said their veggie roll was good. It was, but everything else was a disappointment. ...  ... There was only one other table occupied and a couple at the bar, yet our server was slow and forgot to bring out several items. Our sushi, something that relies on great presentation, was served on chipped white china. We're talking huge chips here. I can't believe they didn't throw the pieces out. ...  ... The food was all pretty bad. I got the egg nigiri, and it was the worst I've ever had. How do you screw up what is essentially an omelette on rice? My husband liked his pink lady roll (not on happy hour), but the 4 other rolls and nigiri he downed only out of ravenous hunger. ...  ... If you live in this area, stick with Sakana for well-priced decent sushi.
33	5	0	1	0	This has been our recent sushi spot! fresh fish (love the nigiri and the baked scallop roll)... great dishes from ... the kitchen (killer chicken wings appetizer and yummy yakisoba)! Great service and fast sushi prep! Our weekly sushi fix is satisfied x 10 at Sushi Ave
33	4	0	1	0	Nice local place with some interesting rolls you won't get at other places! My favorite was the tiger roll. We also liked their gyoza and tofu appetizer. Great service.. We plan on coming back!
33	4	0	0	0	I loved this place! The menu had pictures, which helped us pick out some tasty rolls! The New York roll was our fav! ... Friendly staff and a neat ambiance! ... We'll be back!
33	5	0	0	0	I wrote my first review last week, because of a horrible experience  at Sushi room! Now I am pleased to say EAT HERE!!!  Sushi Ave was the opposite of that other place. ...  ... It was quiet, but it was 2 pm on a Thursday, the nice thing is most sushi bars close up at that time to prepare for dinner,  but they don't! the sushi was fresh the atmosphere pretty and pleasant.  I had a groupon, I spent about 7 dollars over the groupon and I was way stuffed. they do have specials and lunch, but groupon doesn't  let you do that. so I indulged with 3 big rolls I highly recommend to the sushi lover that likes their fish raw, the ultimate spicy tuna roll.   The sushi chef Min was pleasant and  fast, and her rolls were not only delicious but  beautiful. I also had the Arizona roll and another ,the name escapes me at the moment, all delicious, Min was very quick to please  they illiminate something on the roll for me (not  a fan of the sweet sauce) and  she says we can switch something also.  I am so happy to give this clean quaint little  strip mall sushi a 5 star rting, it is near Higley and Elliot 866 Higley, easy to find. I am going back with my daughter tomorrow  to celebrate my brothers Birthday , he is in our hearts and he taught me to eat sushi back in the 70's I miss him, but finding this place to remember him  will be a real celebration of  how the human spirit prevails. He taught me so long ago to enjoy sushi, and I found a new local place to celebrate his life on his birthday , and any day of the year, it is close to home! ...  ... EAT HERE!  Kudos to them not closing down in the afternoon to prepare for dinner, so when my daughter gets out of school we can drive down the road to enjoy our guilty pleasure, fresh sushi! ...  ... Peace.
33	3	1	1	1	I'm not gonna lie the food here is good I have no problem with the food. The service is just way too slow. It's not even that they are bad it's just that it takes forever to get your food. The people are nice, but they def need some more servers or something. I wish that the food didn't take so long because it was actually pretty good.
33	2	0	0	1	Boring. Sushi is mediocre. Prices are expensive. Rolls are of low quality and limited on fish. Place is usually empty. Don't even know how they stay a float.  ...  ... The ambiance is clean and nice. Service was average. Really meh and not somewhere I would head back to unless prices were more reasonable.
33	4	0	0	0	Really enjoyed all of the rolls we tasted. Sushi was as great. It always make me sad the are only coke. :(. We had the Vegas, rolling tiger(yummy), spicy yellowtail, red lobster, ( this was our fav) dragon, baked scallop(this was our least fav) the tempura was very light and good. Thanks for a great meal sushi ave.
33	4	0	0	0	Very friendly staff. Food was good. But pricey but maybe I'm not used to sushi prices yet. Presentation was great, cane it on a boat plate. We missed happy hour but it looked life good deals.
33	5	0	0	0	Wow, just got take out for the first time last night. Seaweed Salad, California Roll and Spicy Salmon Roll. The salad was fresh and delicious with a slight hint of heat. Very, very good. The rolls were both delicious as well. Very fresh and the rice was light and fluffy. The kind of sushi I like to close my eyes and enjoy while eating it. When I went to pick it up, I was surprised at how nice the restaurant was inside. It's just a tiny storefront next to an auto parts store. My wife and I will be going in soon to try more food.
34	5	0	1	0	I have absolutely no complaints about this place.  The apartment complex has a Tuscan style theme.  The buildings and landscaping are very beautiful.  It is a little pricey but well worth it.  There are free wine nights once a week, dinners twice a month and yoga every Monday.  It's a great way to meet people.  I've made so many friends here.  There is such a great sense of community. The office staff is great and the maintenance is speedy.  There are two lavish pools, open 24 hrs and heated during the winter.  The location is pretty ideal; very close to the Chandler Mall, Target, 202 and 101.  I am buying a house soon and I will be very sad to leave :(
34	5	0	0	0	Great atmosphere, love the amenities and friendly, dedicated staff!
34	4	0	0	0	Used to live here when it was owned by a different company. They used to have weekly wine & cheese nights hosted at the clubhouse and most people in the office were very friendly. The community was very outgoing and many of us are still good friends even though we moved out (bought a house). ...  ... Since we left, the property has been under new ownership and I've heard some negative things about. Hopefully they will bring back the weekly wine nights. In general, the new staff does not seem as warm and welcoming as the old staff. ...  ... Amenities are nice and they offer fully furnished apartments. The option for a garage was also a big plus for us! ...  ... Don't pay your rent with your credit card unless you want a $25 service fee. Paying with a direct deposit from your bank account is free :-)
34	3	0	0	0	I have been living here from the past 6 months . Management is great , very friendly and very helpful. Services are done immediately .  ... Pros: Nice community, friendly management apartments are spacious. ... Cons: They only have Century link and Noisy (by gardeners, cleaner) quite often.
35	5	3	3	5	What fun!  Tonight was her first show before opening!  She is truly Divine!  Seeing the show -- even with a few flaws -- made her seem, if possible, more flawless!   ...  ... Her show is high energy -- a laugh riot -- she's really seriously funny -- and then pure Bette -- great music, hilarious jokes, completely current - and a reflection on her past -- and what fun she has.  It's a great ride.  First there are gorgeous showgirls - she calls them her Caesar Salad Girls ("22 babes with 44 perfect tits" and not a French Canadian circus performer in the bunch -- big laughs here...) and the Staggering Harlots (her 3 lovely backup singers) -- who arrive in Vegas, thanks to a tornado in the desert...and... "boy is my ass tired..." (she comes onstage riding a burro...) ...  ... It's going to be a superhot show -- and she says it best -- with "me, Cher & Elton -- what a lineup for the gays!"  Big applause here... She's raw -- yes, more than a few f-bombs (the folks sitting next to us left after the second song, but it was definitely their loss...) -- "I'm a f***ing Goddess...dammit...  ...  ... She sang non-stop (6 really quick costume changes) for 100 minutes solid...no  lip synching here...(take a lesson, Britney and Ashley...).   ...  ... The best moments were the bubbles -- she came out after her first costume change and we think, she fell off her shoes -- after a hilarious save -- she gave the shoes to someone offstage, reentered and did the song all over barefooted -- she was terrific.   ...  ... Her big hits -- still are...she gets them all in.   You won't be disappointed for a second... ...  ... Bette, welcome to Vegas!  We're so happy you're here!
35	5	5	2	3	Yippee Yahoo..... ...  ... Okay.... so we are flying to Vegas in our nicely upgraded first class seats... we meet two men who are also flying to Vegas in their nicely upgraded first class seats... we start chatting.... they ask what we are planning to do while in Vegas... we say... "sorta open might take in a few shows".... they say... "Well we had two friends who were suppose to come to see Bette Midler with us but they had to cancel"... "would you ladies like the tickets".....Wow... we say "of course we would how much do you want for the tickets".... they say "nothing".......  Turns out these tickets had a face value of $300.00 count em $300.00 each!!!   We offered to buy them dinner, take them for drinks, do strip, suck, tease... I mean we are in Vegas after all and what happens in VEGAS stays in VEGAS.... Ohhhh did I mention these two guys were GAY.  They gave us a great gift without expecting anything nor would they take anything in return.  Ahhhhhhhhh I love life!!!   ...  ... Now on to the show.  Bette is simply a wonderful entertainer and great comedian.  She had us in stitches.  Her voice projects and her talent and how gracious she is with her fans is totally unbelievable.  Our seats were 13 rows back center stage.  Can't get any better than that.
35	5	1	1	1	My mother, sister, and I went to see Bette when we were in Vegas this weekend at her "The showgirl must go on" show.  It was great!  She is such a great entertainer.  She made you laugh, cry, and cheer out loud.  She was telling some of the funniest jokes, and some of the segments in the show were hilarious.  In her usual style, she belted out her classics flawlessly.   ...  ... I wondered how the show would be as my mother wanted to see it, but I was not let down.  There definitely was some adult humor, and I havent laughed that hard in awhile!  The showgirls are gorgeous, Bette is a diva, and I highly recommend you go see this show! ...  ... You will not be sorry!
35	5	1	1	1	Bette is in wonderful form for her show at the Ceasar's Palace. ...  ... Our group had a great time - we laughed...we cried...we sang...we highly recommend it even if you're not a big Bette fan. I wouldn't say I'm a big Bette fan myself but I really enjoyed the music, the dancing, the set, and of course...the showgirls - and that includes Bette.
35	5	2	1	3	When I saw Bette Midler being interviewed on someone's TV show earlier this year, she mentioned she will probably retire after her Las Vegas two year run. Retire?  Well, she is 62.  I've been to Bette Midler concerts for the past 30 years and thought okay, i've gotta go to this one even if she does make a comeback at age 70... ...  ... I wasn't disappointed.  The venue was huge...how did she run back and forth across the stage?  There wasn't a bad seat in the house, although bringing a pair of binoculars is recommended if you can't afford the $300 tickets and are seated in the upper levels.  The Divine Miss M's energy wasn't toned down much, although she did include aging jokes several times in her schtick.  But, she still could get around in that mermaid costume and tell those nasty, fun jokes. And her voice is still as big as ever.  She still belts 'em out!  If you can afford to go, it's one not to miss.  We used our tax incentive checks...flew Virgin Air (GREAT) and stayed at The Platinum Hotel (see review).
35	5	0	0	0	I saw the show two nights in a row and enjoyed it tremendously both nights. ...  ... The Devine still is.  The show was Fun, Enjoyable and Heartwarming.  Long time fans will not be disappointed. ...  ... I lucked out in getting great seats (thanks to AE presales), only two rows behind Clive Davis.  I hear Celine was also in the house Friday night, but missed seeing her.  The expensive seats are well worth the great view.
35	5	0	0	0	This is a current version of an old school Vegas show. Bette still has a great voice, great delivery of jokes, and a personality like you have known her forever. The sets were great. All the seats are good at Ceasers.
35	4	0	1	0	Bette Midler is a classic and she is worth seeing. Her show is like a typical Las Vegas show with showgirls aka the Caesar Salad girls. The untypical part that is Bette are the dirty jokes interlaced between the eye tearing ballads. The women can sing and she look fabulous for a lady over 60. I got discount tickets using a discount code from Travel Zoo. My tickets were $45 before the service fees and the seats are in the first mezzanine.
35	5	1	2	2	Bette Midler is an entertainer in every sense of the word. She sings, she dances, she acts, she tells bawdy jokes and all this at the tender age of 63.  ...  ... This is an old school Vegas show and it radiates class. It's worth every dime to see a performer of this caliber in person. Bette sings for nearly 100 minutes during this show.  ...  ... See this show while you can and spring for seats on the floor so that you can truly enjoy it. But skip the $130 souvenir t-shirt.  ...  ... The showgirl must go on, indeed!
35	4	0	0	0	My dad got some free tickets to watch Bette Midler so I decided to take advantage of it (i think i was the youngest person there- seriously!) ... I think I only know one song by Bette and that's it- my dad tells me that he's been listening to her songs over 30 years ago, before I was born. The crowd were mainly older adults and the stadium was packed. ...  ... I enjoyed the show, mainly when she was singing the slower songs and when she was talking and crackin jokes. The fast beat songs just didnt cut it for me. The stage set up, costumes and dancers were all great. As for Bette Midler, she is FREAKING HILARIOUS!
35	4	0	0	0	I had absolutely no expectations going into the show.  That way, I would be neither disappointed nor... appointed?  (jk) ...  ... Well I'm happy to report that Bette Midler puts on an amazingly hilarious and enjoyable show!  She is truly a world-class entertainer and perfect for the Las Vegas strip.  The production is also of high quality with excellent lighting, backgrounds, and props. ...  ... I was surprised to discover how potty-mouthed she is.  Do not bring your kids!  She may also alienate some people with her left-wing jokes.  Funny stuff! ...  ... Incidentally, the highlight for me was definitely "The Rose."
35	5	0	0	0	The whole reason we planned a trip to Vegas was to see Bette Midler. My Mom saw her perform at a concert in central park in the 70's on her way to fly to Europe. I always heard her tell that story and thought that since I've become such a Bette fan myself, it would be a great experience to see her perform together in Vegas. She's just such a stellar old school performer. She has these little quips thrown in between songs and a knack for interacting with the audience. Not to mention her cast of back up dancers that help carry the show. She can belt it out like nobodies business. And she looked AMAZING in costume after costume.
35	5	0	0	0	Bette Midler still has it. She did her shtick, cracked a few jokes, and sang all of her good songs. I really enjoyed the showgirls - from the dancing to the costumes - really made the show. I do have to say that the mermaid routine in the middle was a little "huh?" but again the costumes were divine.  ...  ... It is definitely an adult show and it was amusing watching the reactions of some of the older guys sitting around us. The show was an hour and a half with no intermission.  ...  ... We were in the 1st Mezzanine and the seats were good. The Coliseum is an excellent venue - very large, nice big stage, plush seats. They even have a bar so you can bring a drink in (note that the prices are way above your typical Vegas price).
35	5	0	1	2	Bette was fabulously funny and the show was great. Yes, my sister and I were the youngest in our row by 20 years, but we enjoyed the show.  ... Bette was current on her stories & jokes poking fun at celebrities and herself throughout the show.  ... The singing, dancing, the set & costumes were AMAZING!  ... If you have the funds, go see this.
35	4	0	2	3	Please make way for the fantabulous Miss M aka Bette Midler! She is funny, down to earth, "REAL" and an awesome performer! Before I saw her, I ranked Tina as the highest Diva/Live Performer, now, Bette gets the place of honor. ...  ... This shows has everything to keep you going, the quintessential Vegas-style Showgirls, the no hold barred jokes & fun and great collection of songs that you can relate too. ...  ... My partner & I were lucky to get a really good deal on the tix. We bought our tix at Ceasers box office in the morning of the Saturday, Nov 7, 2009 show. We got a deal for 2 rear orch seat back to back by the corner for only $145 each instead of $180. But being me, i went back to the box office an hour before the show and asked if there's better seat available in the center section and of course there were & even next to each other, so, we upgraded to the middle 2 seats of 4th rows from the front of the center section of rear orchestra and paying the full price of $180 each, its WORTH IT! I dont even need to use my binocular, the theater is just right size and in my opinion, theres no bad seat as long as you keep to the floor... ...  ... So, if you are in Vegas and Bette is playing, GO! This is a MUST SEE show of Vegas... My partner and I had a great time and i was all sentimental during the finale when she rendered the lovely "Wing Beneath My Wing". Love ya Bette!
35	5	2	1	2	WHATA SHOW! WHATA DAME! I feel privileged to see her 2ed to last show at the fabulous Cesar's Palace Coliseum! Where does this broad get all her energy? She sings (LIVE!), dances and tell the dirtiest jokes! These young performers today could learn A LOT from the Divine Ms. M!! BRAVO BETTE!!
35	5	0	0	0	Bawdy, gaudy & just like Bette.  The stage was a little big and the scenery a bit sparse at times, but Bette was the focus.  Her Delores bit in the middle is a scream.
35	5	0	0	0	One of the best shows in Las Vegas, I am sad that January is her last month, I have seen her show two times and each time it was marvelous. Theres a lot of her hits as well as songs I haven't heard and also throws in some comedy making it an enjoyable night for everyone. The first time I sat in the front orchestra pretty close to the stage and they were awesome seats. The second time in rear orchestra, which is farther back, but come on it's Bette Midler, I am happy just to say we shared the same building. When she comes back this month make it a must see, she won't be here too much longer.
35	5	14	11	13	The first and last time I saw Bette Midler perform live was ...brace yourself...34 years ago when she was touring to plug one of her early albums. I was a pimply-faced teen who just got my driver's license and borrowed my dad's aquamarine '68 Pontiac Catalina to drive to the Berkeley Community Center with a gaggle of like-minded pubescents. I remember not only her repertoire of mostly retro-songs but also her hilarious impersonation of Shelley Winters in "The Poseidon Adventure" (it requires placing your belly on a barstool).  ...  ... She's 64 now and looking pretty great all things considered. Her show this past Sunday, cheekily dubbed "The Showgirl Must Go On", is not only a tribute to her storied career but also a fresh take on her legendary status amid the recycling of familiar characters from days of yore such as Delores DeLago, the wheelchair-riding mermaid lounge mainstay, and aged chorine Soph, Bette's tribute to burlesque comedienne Sophie Tucker. The show starts with a CGI-generated twister on a big screen that segues into Bette singing her big-band number, "Big Noise from Winnetka". The energy never flags, least of all Bette, who goes through the mandatory costume changes in record time. ...  ... Unlike Cher's more contemporary, Cirque-inspired show, Bette's is pure vintage Vegas with twenty beautiful showgirls, the Caesar Salad girls, to go along with her back-up trio, the Staggering Harlettes (her term, not mine). The ever-changing sets are elaborate and sumptuous, but nothing overshadows the diminutive Midler. Her voice is the best I've heard it in a long time despite a lost crescendo note on "When a Man Loves a Woman". All the hits are here from the kitschy "Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy of Company B" (backed by a video of her as the Andrews Sisters circa 1973) to "The Rose" (performed as a duet with surprise guest Pink) to her vocal high point, a haunting rendition of John Prine's "Hello in There".  ...  ... But Bette is also a first-class comic providing risque zingers about Celine Dion, Sarah Palin, Rush Limbaugh and Tiger Woods to make even this fan blush between hysterical fits of laughter ("I guess his wife didn't know what he meant when he said he was playing 18 holes."). The woman just knows how to deliver a punchline. She even sets up her last song with sincere gravity and starts to sing the opening bars of Celine's "My Heart Goes On" before taking things more seriously with "Wind Beneath My Wings". Jamie W. and I had great seats in the rear orchestra section which cost us $145 a piece the day before. Well worth it given that Bette proved to be both a diva and a trouper throughout the ninety-minute set. My one regret in sharing this review now is that she finishes her two-year run at the Colosseum at the end of the month, but I'm sure Bette is not one to avoid another encore.
35	5	0	0	0	Bette Midler is amazing! Her show is a combination of full-out performances with her Caesar Salad girls and her Harlettes, individual odes to her classic songs, and a string of jokes punching fun at the latest news headlines. I'm so glad to have caught the show before it ends this month. ...  ... My friend and I found some amazing tickets for sale through Travelzoo. We ended up spending $45 (before tax) for rear orchestra seats. Yes, we were sitting all the way to one side but it was amazing nonetheless. ...  ... This show is not meant for kids as she does use "colorful" language, but that's the beauty of Bette. She is so funny and just being herself. ...  ... What was great was that she ended the show with a plug for supporting the people of Haiti by having her folks stand outside with buckets to collect donations. And she said that she would more than match whatever was collected. Bette is first-class all the way! ...  ... Since she's ending her show this month, all her merchandise is on sale in her and Cher's store. They sell these gift bags inside the show, but I'd recommend going to the store and buying the items individually  to save your money and buy the things you actually want.
35	5	3	6	5	The first time I saw Bette was at the (formerly known as) MCI center about nine years ago in Washington D.C. We had nose bleed seats and the acoustics were awful.  It was like being under one hundred feet of water and trying to watch something fifty feet above the water, so I really didn't get to experience Bette.  I really didn't have any expectations when I went to see her for her first performance in 2010.  A good friend invited me to go and a shared experience was enough to get me to go. ...  ... I had no idea what was in store for me. Hello Cesar's, with infinitely better acoustics and stage!  Nice to meet you, Orchestra Center Row J seats!  OMG!  Nice to meet you, Bette.. not some blurry echoing reverberating splotch but a real live person!  (and I must say.. you are looking fantastic) ...  ... Her voice is amazing.  The show has a great range.  The Ceaser's chorus girls are talented and beautiful.  To top it off, Bette really connects with the audience.  She is hot and electrifying!  Go see her!  Now!
35	5	0	1	1	Simply divine! Went to the last show last night (I have been 3 previous times) and it was the best Bette yet. She Mentioned that she sang for the queen (of England LOL) this past year and she was asked to do a Beetles tune. She performed "In My Life" with Jake Shimabukuro accompanying her on ukelele, so that was a treat for someone(MOI) from Hawaii, then Gladys Knight showed up and serenaded her (&us) with "The Way We Were". Bette cried. During a regular part of her act that she talks about various LV entertainers including Donny & Marie across the street and uses the "F" word (in a funny way) ......anyway, during this bit...Marie Osmond came running down the aisle and teased Bette about her liberal use of the "F" word. Bette was shocked and it threw off her show a tiny bit, but was so cool. Celine Dion did a filmed sendoff for Bette that was lovely and did I say Bette cried and we cried along with her. In this economy, there will be no new extravagant production like this any time soon. Las Vegas is a little darker tonight. Love you Miss M. You truly are divine sweetheart!
35	4	1	0	0	She is still FanFuckingTastic!!  Funny, charming, tearjerking, exotic, erotic, a gal's gal, and a boys wetdream of the lead cougaress. ... The show was old LV and modern too.  Lots of glitz, showgirl tits, ass shakin, raunchy bawdy punchlines;  But something was missing. ... They needed to do ONE MORE show stopping eye popping trick to really make it unforgettable. ... But I will see her again!
35	5	1	2	3	Well, it's been almost a year since we went and saw Bette.  She puts on an amazing show! I had won the tickets on the radio (yay!) and almost gave them away, because we hadn't heard much about it.  Wow...we almost missed out on a great performance. There was amazing costumes, good music, and she keeps you laughing throughout the entire show.  I would pay to see her again...you won't be disappointed!
36	4	0	5	0	Don't let the appearance fool you, this place is new but give them a chance :) ... A hole in the wall mom and pop spot. ...  ... I ordered a Thai Beef Ball soup for take out, can't say anything bad about it. Taste like mamas home cooking.
36	5	0	1	0	Excellent authentic Thai dishes.  Take out or eat in--either way, The food is delicious. ... The prices are very reasonable and the kitchen looks very clean.  The food is as good as any Thai restaurant in Las Vegas --  if not better.  I have been to Thailand and eaten authentic Thai food.  I don't have to travel to Thailand  for excellence any more.
36	5	0	1	0	Just came from dinner at Thai Noodles Cafe.  The restaurant atmosphere pleasant, the food was excellent and the prices very reasonable.  Will definitely eat there again soon.
36	4	0	0	0	Def a great mom and pops place! Prices are reasonable, food is Delish! Place could use a remodel but get I'm here for the food!
36	3	0	0	0	It was pretty good, but not completely awesome.  Service was great, but the egg rolls were frozen from packages - I saw him take them out of the freezer, and served to me with literally 7 skinny shreds of dried out cabbage and carrots. ... There are only seats for about 12 people in the entire place.  The panang curry was good, but I ordered spicy level 3, and it was SO SPICY I had a difficult time eating it. ... It is clearly a mom n pop place, so I'd give it another try if I lived around to support their business.
36	4	0	1	0	What a pleasent little surprise Thai Noodle Cafe turned out to be.  I don't know how long it has been open but I just saw it recently and being so close to home for me I had to try it.  My initial impression, it is a small kind of place.  It felt like an old pizza kitchen.  Like maybe it was a Dominoe's at one time.  There are a couple of tables and a counter with a couple of pamphlet folded menus along with some pictures and paintings on the walls.  Not much else to speak of here.  It was quiet when I walked in.  Though it was 5:45 in the evening there were no other diners.  I walked right up to the counter, glazed over the menu for a minute and decided on my favorite Thai Red Curry.  It was ready in just over 5 minutes which had me concerned.  How fresh could it be coming out so quickly?  It also looked like a small serving.  Did I just pay $9.69 for disappointment?  Alas, my fears were put to rest when I got home and began to serve myself up.  There was a lot more curry and rice than I had thought.  The packaging was deceptive.  And this was good food too.  It did not taste like it had been sitting out waiting for me at all.  There was a a ton of curry and coconut flavor going on, the chicken was tender, the vegetables (bamboo, carrots and bell pepper) were still crisp and the steamed rice was still steaming.  The fresh basil used was the sweet Thai variety and was a nice touch.  Sometimes basil can be too pungent and overpowering.  This was a perfect compliment to a good curry and that made for a nice evening.
36	5	0	0	0	Very good pad thai. in Arizona we are use to seeing taco places like this hole in the wall places witch are always the good ones. I had again the pad thai and pineapple fried rice. And make shure you ask for it mild cause even mild is spicy. The pineapple fried rice is even amazing. They dont deliver however I found out threw grub hub they do they offer delivery that way. VERY good and polite staff well driver. Looking forward to triing other dishes.
36	2	0	1	0	I give this place a two because I had the pad thai I ask for 2 in spicy and it was soo spicy my stomach hurted my mouth was burning. I could taste the original flavor of the pad thai. I can only imagine what a 5 or 10 taste like. Wish it wasn't spicy so I could enjoy it.
36	4	0	0	0	I've been wanting to try this place for months and finally went today. I ordered the spicy basil beef (spicy level #5 out of 10) I gave it 4 stars because the food was very delicious. I didn't give it full 5 stars because I was very disappointed with the portion size. There was so much vegetables and very little meat. Also another thing I questioned was every other place ordering spicy basil beef its been ground beef this place made it with sliced beef it honestly looked and tasted like Mongolian beef but still good. I dont know if I'll order it again but the customer service, Thai tea, & over all food taste was good enough for me to go back and try something else next time.
36	4	0	0	0	I've been to different Thai food places and for the most part a number 9 in spicy level is pretty mild, not the case at all with Thai Noodle Cafe!! I ordered Pad thai noodles and basil chicken both number 7 thinking it'd be pretty mild, boy was I surprised. It was extreme spicy. I'm Mexican and I love spicy food and this was good but super spicy. Both were great dishes. Like others said the servings are quite small for the main entrees but it was more than enough pad thai. Would definitely order again, but at a spicy level of 4 next time!
37	2	0	0	0	The entire staff does not speak English enough to relate comfortably with them about what you want done.  Happily they are not talking constantly to each other like the shop I tried last time...Envy Nails...the conversation there was constant, personal and loud.... ... This shop does not use liners in their pedi basins...I thought it was a law but whether it is or not, I like that feature.  Their utensils do not look clean.  Like another review said....everything cost extra and my callus's were not even slightly removed and I get Pedi's every 2 weeks.  Guess I will have to go a little further to my old salon, Highland nails....Andy gives a great pedi. ...  ... Hardly ever does a shop take AMEX...and neither does this one
37	2	0	0	0	LAZY--- I've been here a few times when I was in a hurry only because the place I really like is busy. ... They never do a fully good job. They always rush thru the job. Skip a step or forget.  ... Like today I went for a mani/pedi. I had to ask the guy to file my nails after he brushed the nail file over them once leaving them uneven. REALLY!! I know he can see. Then he only cut have of my cuticles. Got up and forgot when he came back. When I asked him to do it of course I looked like the bad guy.  ... Same with the manicure the lady gave me and the last time was just as bad. Uneven nails they don't clean underneath the nails and just walk away. No thank you nothing. I will never go back. I know now to always make an appt at the place I like
37	1	0	0	0	Horrible, got the most painful fill of my life!! Super glue under nails, sore around cuticles
38	5	0	3	1	This place has the charm and authenticity of Los Sombrero's, but the prices and comfort of El Bravo. The ingredients were fresh and tasty, and the dishes themselves were traditional but oh-so perfectly original.  ...  ... The chips they brought to the table were still warm and obviously cooked in house. The salsa rested comfortably in the range of spicy but not too spicy and bursted with flavor.  ...  ... Mucho Gusto is perfect for the Mexican food purist or out-of-towner that has never experienced true south of the border flavor. It has been selected as Best of Phoenix by the New Times and after checking it out, it's clearly well deserved.
38	5	11	10	11	Let me exalt your praises, Mucho Gusto. Don't blush darling. Our love will not remain in the shadows!  ...  ... Do you remember the time that you almost tried to set my boyfriend on fire? You put on an amazing little impromptu firework show when your misters got into a fight with that pesky string of lights, but you were kind enough to quell our fear and try to erase that memory with free alcohol, you wily little minx. You needn't delete him from the equation. We're usually game for a three way with you, Mistress Gusto. ...  ... That was right when the two happiest hours in my otherwise hellacious day were coming to an end. You do know that between the hours of four and six, your warm embrace and sweet nectar are all I need to forget about the dramarama of the office. The memories of your hibiscus, tamarind and mango margaritas, frosty Dos XXs and generous glasses of sauvignon blanc bring a smile to my face, especially with a three dollar price tag. ...  ... And you're always very gracious when I graze freely on the chips and salsa when I'm feeling frugal. I don't know what combination of chili and spices you sprinkle on your toasty little delights, but they're positively divine. Although they can't even hold a candle to your tasty salsa. ...  ... To help keep me from acting like a lush, which would greatly embarrass me in your presence, you offer half price appetizers during happy hour. That guacamole of yours with the pomegranate seeds has a zesty twist, while your gigantic Mexican pizza and mountainous machaca nacho plate have lured large groups of my friends to your patio and bar on many an occasion. Sharing is caring, and you're trying to teach the world to be a better place, one shrimp cocktail at a time.  ...  ... When I'm feeling like a nice lunch or dinner instead of our usual rendezvous, your pozole always brings me happiness, with snow white hominy afloat in a sea of green and lots of tortillas to sop up that goodness. Your Colorado Stew is likewise as delectable, as are the Mexican street tacos. I especially dig how you let me mix and match three tacos, so I can add a red chili pork taco and fried fish taco into the mix! ...  ... Your cute little bistro setting with the beaded lamps and cushy bench seating made a delightful setting for a first date, while your exemplary menu, service and specials has had me coming back ever since. It's a good thing I'm not the jealous type, because I want to share you with all of Tempe.
38	3	0	2	0	The margaritas and guacamole are my two favorite things about this cute, colorful Tempe restaurant. Be sure to try the strawberry margarita and the guacamole is an absolute must. It's sweet and has a unique taste. And when fall is in the air, be sure to enjoy this combo on the restaurant's darling patio. Mucho Gusto is a fun place to spend happy hour with a group of friends.
38	2	0	2	0	This is standard Mexican fare for the area.  Unfortunately, that doesn't mean it's good.  Generally, I eat the best food at home.  We have raw milk, raw butter, and raw cheese.  My husband of Mexican lineage cooks fabulous New Mexican food when he can procure true chiles from New Mexico.  We buy very fresh fruits and vegetables and meat from pastured animals or wild fish and shellfish. So whenever I go out to a "Mexican restaurant," I don't expect anything as good as I get at home.  Even so, I can't tolerate this stuff.  I ate lunch there, and it's sat in my gut like a rock ever since (5.5 hours now).  I had salsa & chips, and the enchilada trio (I believe I had a cheese one, a chicken one, and a pork one).  A $13 entree for lunch, which wasn't very good - too much for me to pay for something I can't digest very well.  Everything had an odd flavor, like it wasn't quite real food.  Yes, I only went once, and I won't be going back.
38	4	0	0	1	I have gone here a couple of times in the last few weeks and have to say we had great service each time.  We went for lunch on a Saturday afternoon and they only had one waitress working but she was attentive, personable and our drinks were always full.   ...  ... I think the food here is good albeit a dollar or so overpriced.  I have had quite a few items but I can recommend the Red Chili Pork Tacos over everything I have tried so far.  The food is good quality and the salsa is reliably tasty.  These are two requirements for my Mexican dining needs. ...  ... Another plus about this place is its sizable patio.  Nothing beats eating outside during our awesome  AZ winter.
38	4	0	2	2	great service. great drinks. unique and delicious menu. ...  ... i've been here twice.  ... once with adventurous eaters who loved it. ... and once with boring eaters who were still pleased. ...  ... i highly recommend dining here!
38	5	2	2	2	Ok ... I LOVE this place. ...  ... Wussies beware though, its rather spicy. ...  ... My favorite are the flautas appetizer.  Its enough for a meal for me.  Two large flautas are stuffed with cheese and beef, then drenched in a delicious red sauce. ...  ... MMMMMM!!!! ...  ... OMG ... They also have this berry chimichanga type dessert.  I dream about it at nighttime.
38	4	1	1	1	I have been here many times, but not recently so I didn't feel like I could review it till I had been back.  First off great chips and salsa!  I have never been disappointed with anything I have had here...the big and little ass burritos are great... I have also had the chimichanga, tamales, and street tacos.  All were very good.  My only complaint was the service this time... extremely slow at lunch time.  I understand lunch rush... believe me I do... but you can't leave your table sitting for so long without coming by.  It took forever for anyone to initially come to our table and then she just disappeared.  It was kind of hot out and we were on the patio baking away.  I am being generous with the stars because you should really give it a try.  I am certain that the service issue was a fluke.
38	4	1	2	2	I dig this joint!  Stopped by because oregano's was jam packed.  So glad for that.  I had lunch with 4 buddies.  We had (Chris?), I think that is his name, (the owner of the establishment) order us 3 meals to split between 4 people.  Each of us had a drink and the bill with tip was 36bucks.  It was a Thursday in the middle of lunch hour and although I NEVER expect quick and decent service at a mexican joint, I was pleasantly surprised.  Our experience was 100% psotive and i would come back here in a heart beat.  unfortunately i cannot recall the exact meakls we had.  A fish taco of sorts...a meat taco of sorts and then another meal which 4-5 daysd later I cannot even try to describe what it was....sorry bout that.  Great experience, Great establishment..MUCH GUSTO to ya'll.
38	4	3	5	1	Take Erica's review,  add the sangria rocks! Whoohoo. Seriously I love the guac, anytime you add pomegranate you can't go wrong. Their carne tacos and chimis are delicious, the patio is great when the weather is nice.
38	5	0	0	0	Yum! I love this place. I came here for dinner once and really enjoyed my meal. The guacamole is great; it is $7, but worth it. I was in town again and went back here for lunch. Another good meal with good service.
38	4	0	0	0	Great margarita's, great food, great people. Low key hangout kinda place. ... can't go wrong.
38	4	0	3	3	Jalepeno margarita. Hibuscus margarita. Strawberry margarita.  Just a few of their homemade flavored margaritas.   ...  ... I've only been here for happy hour, but the prices were good and the margaritas were great, we got some taquitos which were really good too, the sauce was to die for.  ...  ... I Can't wait to hang out on the patio.  ...  ... Only one thing, wish they were open on Sundays.
38	4	1	1	1	Mucho Gusto is a great little taqueria!  I've been there a few times before for dinner and drinks, but last night it was me and the ladies for margaritas.  Mucho Gusto was actually our second choice for the evening as Mill ave was packed with those silly Sun Devil fans (Bear Down!).  We each had a couple margaritas and munched on chips and salsa.  I really appreciate that they brought out a few bowls of salsa for the table so you don't have to reach for the drippy stuff across the table.  Chips were perfectly crispy and salty.  The margaritas were delicious and tasted homemade rather that the result of a store bought mix.  Service was friendly, but less than attentive.  We had to wait a bit for drink refills and when the server cleared our chips and salsa to bring fresh, he never brought the fresh chips or salsa.  Mucho Gusto has a great patio which is apparently dog friendly.  Another customer had his two dogs there.   I'm all about pet friendly, but these dogs were roaming the patio off leash.  Kind of strange for their owner and the staff to allow that.  Oh well, I suppose it just made it seem more authentically Mexican!
38	4	2	6	4	Went for happy hour the other day. $3 margaritas, $5 apps and all are delicious. Had the flautas and they were wonderful, shredded beef simmered for hours, so tneder and juicy, then stuffed into a tortilla and covered in a red smoky sauce...Two girls, 2 margaritas and flautas - 20 bucks, now that is happy hour!
38	5	1	2	2	I freakin' love this place. ...  ... Still. ...  ... Sure the service kinda sucks. ...  ... Sure they're not open on Sundays and that's totally lame ...  ... But they're food ... Its just so good! ...  ... I recently had the garlic shrimp entree...... mmmmmmmmm...... SO GOOD!!!  ... (and kinda healthy... so yay!) ...  ... I love.
38	4	4	9	6	My new favorite Mexican place in Tempe. Love their tacos. Their menu only lists them individually, but feel free to mix and match. I usually go with one camarone and one pescado. The shrimp are small, but there are lots of 'em. And the chunks of fried fish are bigger than the taco itself. Portions are generous - I'd have to skip breakfast to be able to finish more than two. Service is friendly and efficient - easy to get in and out during your lunch hour. Also a great spot for happy hour.
38	1	1	2	0	Went to Mucho Gusto on Christmas Eve with family. It was a chilly night and we saw that it got good reviews on yelp, so we stopped in for a early visit- thought some good mexican food and a margarita would warm us up. Our wonderful plan was sabotaged by the worst hostess ever. It was early and the place was empty. We asked to be seated- there were 5 of us- and she proceeded to seat us at a 4 person table right next to the door (remember, it's cold outside, there are 5 of us, and the place is completely empty). As she was setting us up we asked to be sat at a larger table, farther away from the door. She gave us the death stare! My poor family, in from out of town, iced over by some evil control freak. She then reluctantly sat us at another 4 top (we had to drag over another table to fit us all in) and proceeded to complain to the server (within earshot of us) about us, pointing and rolling her beady little eyes. It was then we decided that it just wasn't worth it- we left (with no apologies from any of the other staff) and went to Z-Tejas instead. I would have much rather supported a local establishment, but there is no need for that kind of tude, especially on Christmas Eve!
38	4	0	1	1	The meal I had here was very good (I had that Barra Vieja shrimp), though not spectacular.  The mashed potatoes were probably the best part.  What struck me was the vibe of the place.  Granted, it was 8:30 on a Monday night and the place was more or less empty.  But there  was a snarky, fedora sporting bartender playing cards with the wait staff and a drunk patron, employees drinking at the bar after hours, a random dog running around, a primered chevy pickup and a neat row of bicycles in the parking lot.  The vague disinterest in customer service might have been due to the fact that the place was empty, and there's almost certainly a contingent that would find this off-putting, but it worked for me.  In contrast to several other reviews, my food came out very quickly and my glass was never empty for long.  This is probably a place I would frequent if I lived in the area.
38	1	0	2	1	Craving Mexican food (Friday night around 6:30 pm), looked on line for restaurants close by and found Mucho Gusto.  Had good reviews.  Ilk!  Walked in thru back parking lot.  So cute!  The patio is lighted nicely and reminded us of Los Sombreros.  Not at all the same.  The two of us asked to be seated outside and had to wait 5 minutes for the hostess to seat someone that we didn't see.  So we sat and waitress came over pretty fast.  Ordered just Coke and Sprite with guacamole.  The reduction sauce that came around it sounded interesting.   ...  ... Chips and salsa were alright.  Small bowl with small bowl of pureed sauce.  Smokey sauce.  Alright.  Not too spicy but did have flavor.  Chips were not warm or cold.  Did NOT seem super fresh or stale.  I don't believe ANYTHING is deep fried here.  They have no grease vat in back.  Things on the menu say, "Pan fried".  That proves it, we think.  Guac. was fine.  I make better at home.  How can you really mess up avocado, onions and tomato?  The sweet nutty sauce around the edges was interesting.  Not something I'd HAVE to have again.  Good chips would have made the quac. more fun. ...  ... So, the food seems kind of healthy because they don't deep fry anything on-site.  We waited a long time for drinks and food.  Ordered a second and third bowl of chips and and a second sauce.  I got the enchilada trio with one of each, carnitas, chicken and cheese.  Yuck.  The corn tortillas were not soaked in the canned enchilada sauce.  Came out almost cold.  Both meats were just something they had prepped sitting in warmed containers that could have been scooped and put in those tortillas easily.  No care in making the meat.  Wasn't horrid, just alright.  It was all cubed rather than shredded, which I didn't like.  The cheese was hard in the 3 tortilla.  I think it was jack.  Nothing special.  Enchiladas were covered with that canned red sauce and shredded ice burg lettuce and sour cream that had been squirted on out of a squeeze bottle.  They try.   ...  ... Spanish rice was medium.  The BEANS were atrocious!  I have had better at Taco Bell.  They really seemed reconstituted.  I am serious.  Powdered beans made soupy with water.  They were the worst!  That is bad, because even if everything else is awful, I always appreciate good re-fried beans.  What a disappointment.    ...  ... Husband ordered the Garlic Shrimp Amaretto.  They came out warm/cold too.  There were a good number of them.  Sweet white sauce on shrimp was weird.  They are trying to be interesting again, but it didn't work out here.  Those mashed potatoes that some reviewers like or hate?  I think they are kind of nice.  They seem to be real potatoes.  They are orange and taste a little like the green chile potato from Richardson's.  Veggie on the side were firm and steamed.  Pretty good. ...  ... Waitress was nice and thanked us for being patient overall at the end.  She paid attention to drink, chip and salsa refills.  Took away old plates.  The bill was $44.32 and that is too much for what we got.  Didn't even drink!  Price is too high for quality of food.  Not going back.  Would not recommend to friends.  Not authentic Mexican food.  Not interesting.
38	1	1	2	1	Mucho Gusto es mucho mierda.  ...  ... Let me say first, that the place is cute, the staff is friendly, and the salsa is good. There. I'm not being a total jerk.  ...  ... The food, however, left much to be desired. I couldn't find much to like about my chicken tacos- they were ok, but the meat didn't have much flavor, there was no cheese, and they were pretty stingy with the guacamole and pico. What really got me was that they didn't come with rice and beans. Instead, I got a lovely pile of cheap bagged romaine coated in some sort of caesar-ish dressing. Sure, there were a few cubes of cheese and a tomato slice (A slice!) on top, but come on. $14 for a couple of naked tacos and a pile of romaine? For that much, they could have at least picked the white core parts of the lettuce out of my salad. Or, I dunno, sprinkled a little cheese on the tacos? ...  ... The story was much the same with the fish tacos, only the salad was different. The enchiladas seemed to be a hit, and those are served with rice and beans. the vegan at the table ordered a side of rice and beans for her meal, and they aren't kidding about it being a side. I think my cat's food bowl is bigger.  ...  ... They charge $1 per bowl if you want more chips. I know $1 isn't a big deal, but it's just the principle. I already felt ripped off from the entree, so the extra charge for the chips just made it worse.  ...  ... Needless to say, I won't be going back. There are far better choices closer to home.
38	1	1	1	0	Mucho gusto es much malo, mucho dinero por much nada. ... Our order: 2 fish tacos, comes with salad $14. ... 2 chicken tacos, comes with salad $12. ... A second round of chips is an extra dollar. ... The food was ok, but at those prices should have been spectacular or at least filling. ... If only if is was possible to review somewhere and give them no stars. ... Mucho Gusto would be it.
38	4	0	0	0	Big fan.  Not traditional mexican, but more like Nuevo mexican.  The flautas are the best.   Love the sauce. ...  ... The tacos are OK, the fish ones are the best. ...  ... The crab topped snapper is also very good.
38	5	1	4	3	I can't believe all you crazies giving this place 1 star. This is the best TexMex in the East Valley. It's got a great anti-Tempe vibe right in the heart of Tempe, and that's really refreshing. Plus, the food is ace. Who cares if the service is lame? They bring me my food and drinks and an endless supply of chips and salsa, so I can't complain. Those it's mostly ASU kids manning the tables, it's not an ASU-heavy crowd. It's eclectic and has a great tiny bar when full.  ...  ... The patio scene is one of the better spots in Tempe. I love it when it's a bit chilly outside and they have the fire going. You're right on University, but you feel like you're in your own special nook.  ...  ... Don't skimp on the food. They use organic veggies and farm-raised meat, and it shows. I'm a sucker for the Steak Ranchero, but I've had at least half of the menu at one time or another, and I've never had a disappointing meal. And the margaritas are top notch. Where else can you find a friggin' tamarind margarita? C'mon people. Head in for happy hour and thank me later.
38	5	0	1	2	After living in Tempe for 5 years I finally discovered this place just a few years ago and it's been a solid Lunch experience ever since.  ...  ... I can't say anything for the dinner crowd, but get here before 12pm, order off the lunch menu and you'll have a healthy portion of fresh delicious Mexican food in under 10 minutes.  ...  ... I normally get the Half-Ass Burro, that comes with an excellent side salad and am stuffed every time I leave.  ...  ... I can also say for a great strong margarita pull up a seat at the bar, have some chips and enjoy.  ...  ... Without a doubt this is a perfect break from status-quo fried, rice and beans dishes normally found in the Valley.
38	1	0	1	0	Catchy name.  Nice location.  And I love Mexican food;  I eat it all the time so I know what good Mexican food is...and isn't.  Despite the food looking the part, all of the things that make Mexican food Mexican food were missing from Mucho Gusto's machaca...like taste.  So to me having to pay the prices their menu items command is not worth it.  Not only is the food sub-par, but the prices are inflated.  Much Gusto is overhyped and you will pay a premium for the not-so-goodwill.  I will not return.
38	3	0	2	0	I've been going here for lunch for 3-4 years (on average a couple times a month)...and in that time it seems to be on a slow decent downhill. ...  ... I used to think it had the best fish tacos in town but over time the once crispy flavorfil fish turned ever so slightly soggy. ...  ... Pluses: ... good salsa ... great ice tea ... chips are good but there are better out there ...  ... Minuses: ... Eaten here for dinner twice and been dissapointed both times. ... Service is sometimes dicey
38	4	0	0	0	I had a great lunch experience there last week. The Posole & grilled fish tacos were perfect!  The ambience is nothing to write home about but the food makes up for that.   ... Get here early because indoor seating is limited. I actually saw a business man running across the parking lot to get in before me. Haha
38	5	0	0	0	This is one of my favorite restaurants in Tempe.  The deciding factors: the food and the atmosphere. The food is Contemporary Mexican/Mexican Fusion. At least that is the best way I can come up with to describe it. But perhaps an example would do better: their guacamole appetizer is surrounded by Gran Marnier. It is unique and amazing. As for atmosphere, they have a nice patio that is walled off from the street and parking lot and decorated with fun strings of lights.  Inside, it has a cool lounge-y feel with contemporary Mexican artwork.  The service is very nice and friendly; our favorite waiter is a self-defined music nerd who was really sweet and enthusiastic.
38	3	0	1	1	I have lived practically across the street from this place for years and years and have always wanted to try it.  The Yelp reviews looked promising and I'm always up for something new and local.  Plus, I picked up a $25 Restaurant.com certificate for like $4.  PLUS, if you go to the Mucho Gusto website you can get a coupon good for one free margarita per person.  What a steal, right? ...  ... We went on a Thursday night at about 7 and the place wasn't that crowded.  We opted to sit outside on their great patio because the weather was perfect. ...  ... To start we each ordered a house margarita which were excellent.  Not too strong and not too sweet.  We also ordered the guacamole  which looked interesting and because of the recommendations here on Yelp.  It wasn't the best I've ever had but it was very good.  The Grand Manier jalapeno reduction they drizzle over it gave every bite a slight sweetness,  but I'm not sure that I am totally into sweet guacamole. ...  ... After the appetizer we ordered another round of margaritas.  This time we opted for one of their specialty "flavor infusions" in each of our drinks.  I don't remember what flavor each of us ordered, but you really had to pay attention because the flavor was very subtle.  It was good.......but subtle.  Next time I'm just going to stick to the regular. ...  ... For our entrees we ordered the machaca plate and fish tacos.  The machaca was just ok.  The size was good and the flavor was ok, but all in all it was just eh.  The fish tacos were a lot better but very pricey for what you get. ...  ... I'm not sure if I would rush back to eat dinner there again but I do want to return.  A lot of their other menu items sounds excellent and worth a try.  I will be definitely back in the near future to test out their happy hour which I hear is very good. ...  ... Our server was very fast and friendly and I have no complaints in that department.  I also cannot believe they accepted both our free margarita coupons and the Restaurant.com certificate.  Our $60 dollar bill turned into a $20ish dollar one which was great.  And yes...I tipped on the entire amount of the bill before the discounts.
38	5	2	4	3	Situated in a gorgeous Southwest inspired building on University, this gem has become a favorite of mine for several reasons.  First is the building itself.  You see, the way the light from the sunset pours over the stucco walls and onto the polished cement floor and the dark wood throughout, highlighting the beautiful concoctions in your glass and on the walls, well, that is something which can't be replicated.  To sit and sip a fresh-lime juice Margarita as the light fades from the day, ah. ...  ... Second, every thing I've eaten here has left me wanting more.  In a sea of mediocre Mexican, M.G. stands out as a clear favorite of Phoenix.  I believe the quality and quantity of dishes here blows away your Barrios and Gringos, sure you pay a bit for it, but the Guac is topped with a Grand Marnier and Jalapeno reduction!  Are you kidding me!?! ...  ... Third, and maybe most important, is the excellent Happy Hour that has become a staple of my diet.  Margs and beers for $3, Apps for $5.  The Apps list is large and diverse enough to get me coming back once a week for a year now.  The $10 nachos are $5 at HH and are huge. The rosemary mexican fry-bread pizza is so filling and tasty I can only eat half. The gringo quesadilla comes with a delicious salad topped with queso fresco and corn salsa. Glory! ...  ... I understand all of the lack-luster reviews here, the prices are a bit high for dinner, but the work that goes into what they do must be the cause.  There are a few of over priced, "fancy" dinner places in Tempe, Mucho Gusto is fairly priced, great at Happy Hour. ...  ... Special notes: 1.  The staff is a collection of sweet and hip folk.  Fletcher, the bartender, is a cool cat who'll bend over backwards for you to have a good time.  2.  The guacamole gets a mention again.  It is my favorite in the world. 3. They make a drink called the Mexico City mule, which they special order a ginger ale for, you can't order the ginger ale separately.  The drink is awesome, tequila, ginger and cucumber... try it.
38	1	0	0	0	I found this place painfully disappointing. I have heard others praise it but it so boring. The food lacks imagination and complexity. When we arrived the mood lighting was so low that we could not see the menus- we actually had to hold them up to catch the light- we joked about it at the time but it was very annoying. I ordered a vegetarian burrito and found an abundance of beans and cheese accompanied by about 2 tsp of avocado and a dash of salsa. It was not in any way worth the money.  In addition, my friend ordered surf and turf and got 3 small shrimp and a small steak... I mean really the guy paid $20 for the meal, they could have at least given 5 measly shrimp.  ...  ... On the positive side, the building is pretty and they do give you a dessert if it's your Birthday.  ...  ... I'm not usually very critical but this place needs an honest critique. Don't go to this "Mucho" over priced "Bistro."
38	3	0	1	0	The fact that they have Negra Modelo on Tap is a good sign.The Atmosphere is phenomenal, and the house red salsa is probably the best in phoenix. The Salad that comes with the tacos is light and delightful. But the only thing worthy in the entire menu are the red pork tacos. the pickled red onion salsa that comes with the tacos is amazing but missing that habanero kick..  ... Order a Pacifico Michelada and you'll forget that you're in Phoenix.

38	4	0	1	0	Definitely tasty. ... Stuck in Phoenix for business and this place came recommended. ... The mole is a little sweet but the salsa is flavorful and has a little heat. ... I ordered the slow cooked pork with beans and rice and it was delicious.  Actually the beans had a little different flavor than what i'm used to but I chalk that up to local flavor. The rice to was a little spiced had a couple pieces of corn an carrot and actually had flavor.  I ordered a side of chopped jalapenos for spice and mole because it's my favorite sauce and I like to sample it everywhere I go.  As I mentioned it was a little on the sweet side but very tasty.
38	4	0	0	0	Great food - the salsa is flavorful spicy without being too hot.  The food is innovative yet authentic.  One thing I've learned is that if you get served "orange cheese" you're not in a REAL Mexican restaurant!  The service can be lacking at times, but generally they are on top of things and - especially for lunch - they can get you in and out of there fairly quickly.
38	5	0	0	0	A-MMM-A-A-A-ZING!!! Seriously folks, this place makes some freaking awesome food and margaritas. I literally feel like bursting into song when I get to eat here (and after a few margs, I do). ...  ... The only knock that could possibly be given to this place is it's service. It is hit-and-miss. But seriously folks, what do you expect in a college town? ...  ... My suggestions are going during happy hour for a homemade margarita at a killer deal. Also, for eats, you can't go wrong with the Steak Ranchero or the Mole Chicken. Both make me salivate just to type their names. ...  ... Fortunately if you are starving, it helps that their salsa is righteously good. So, go there soon or run the risk of me beating you there and eating yours too.
38	4	3	0	2	A to the power of two for real ... Brought me to here for a deal ... Lovely service taverna set ... In or out left not one regret ... Found tacos of white corn ... Fish, beef,or pork torn ...  ... What salsa heats my heart inside ... "More chips!" My hungry heart cried ... I can't believe I've been deprived hence ... And the ambiance made crazy sense ... If my restrictions did not limit my hunga' ... I would've downed a chimmichanga' ...  ... I could see plates full of yumminess piled high ... How could i show up here on a diet, why? ... A bit pricier than the average taqueria spot ... There's so much love mixed in this hot pot ... I need to say that a fifth star is not illusive ... Just wish it had drinks more inclusive ... I'll return not just because its on Hardy at Mitchell ... But because it's food speaks my name, Mitchell.... ...  ... Ok... so the rhyme is corny but the experience is not. ... Don't miss this gem tucked away in Tempe...just don't make it hard for me to be seated!
38	4	1	1	1	On recommendation I dropped in for dinner.  The atmosphere was very nice.  An outdoor terrace was very cozy, and indoors the bar was relaxing and personal.   I ordered the Guacamole on recommendation which features a Gran Marinier reduction sauce atop a chunky mound of goodness in a generous sized portion.  Very nice.   I ended up using it along with the rest of my order, which consisted of the Muchaca and Cheese Flautas in a red sauce.  These were extra large and delicious.  I enjoyed having these with the guac and probably could have stopped there, but alas I also got the steak tacos which were perfectly cooked (seared) chunks of marinated steak with the normal fixings and came with an interesting tomato tortilla soup which was a little too "tomato soup" like for me, but still was good.  I paired it all with a Negro Modello that was on tap (nice!).   Heradura and Patron is available to those with a few extra dollars, but that wasn't for me this evening.   The ingredients were all very fresh and very well prepared.  I would definitely come again.
38	5	0	0	0	Just off University, but manages to feel like a little hide-away, and pulls off an enticing mellow atmosphere, suitable for intimate conversation. ...  ... Fish Tacos and a Margarita again please! How many times before I can force myself to experiment?
38	5	0	0	0	Daughter attends ASU and when we visit, we ALWAYS eat at Mucho Gusto.  Their mole is the best I have ever had and their Hibiscus margaritas are seriously addicting.
38	3	0	0	0	It has been awhile since I reviewed Mucho Gusto.  I always used to come for lunch and was never disappointed so thought it would be a good place to meet a friend for drinks and a little food after work.  It was alright... the service was actually pretty bad. I did hear the waitress serving the table next to us that they were short staffed so I guess I can cut them a little slack.  Beyond that though the food was not that memorable this time either and my dinner companion agreed:).    Doesn't mean that I wont come back  I will give them another shot sometime soon:).
38	5	0	0	0	Easily one of my favorite place in Tempe.  The food is great and a bit original (not your basic south of the border fare).  The atmosphere is nice too (pleasant but with a bit of attitude).   ...  ... I love Mexican food and these people do it with a unique flare that is worth checking out.  I have been there for lunch a dozen times or so and dinner a few times and never once disappointed! ...  ...  ... The only complaint I might make is their parking lot is too small (when that is the worst you can say they are not doing too bad). ...  ... In summary great food, great atmosphere - a great place to hang out with friends for a quick or a long dinner - whatever you are feeling like!
38	1	0	0	0	This was my second visit and it will be my last. The first time, a few years ago, I went for my birthday and it was ruined. It took forever and the food was horrible. Decided to give them a second chance. I give up. ...  ... We went last night around 6:30 p.m. and told them we had to be to a show at 7:30 p.m. and asked if it was enough time. The waitress said yes, and at least she was quick getting the food out. Too bad we didn't have time to abort mission and go somewhere else after we took one bite. The food tasted terrible but we ate it anyway, and both my husband and I had some digestive issues today. ...  ... This should have been a clue that the kitchen is not up to par: The menu lists taco plates that come with 2 tacos and either salad or tortilla soup. I asked if I could order a plate with one machaca taco and one carnitas taco. The waitress said no, not at dinner; only at lunch. Huh? So I got the carnitas and hubby got the machaca so we could share. He was concerned 2 tacos wouldn't be enough, so the waitress tells him we can order another taco a la carte. Any kind? Yes. So he gets a grilled fish taco (which came out deep-fried, and of course, the waitress didn't notice, and we didn't want to wait for a grilled one). Why can we get tacos a la carte but we can't split the order? This is one of those arbitrary rules that cooks make up that piss off customers and don't do anything to make the kitchen more efficient. ...  ... So, the food. The tortilla soup was a disgusting bowl of thick orange goop and I sent it back and got the salad with honey-lime vinaigrette, which tasted neither of honey nor of lime, but more like your basic balsamic. The tacos were two corn tortillas (each) with a big pile of mushy, greasy, salty meat -- no onions, cilantro, or cotija. The carnitas came with a few small strands of pickled onion and the machaca had some past-its-prime guacamole -- gee, thanks. The meat was cooked to death, to the point where I couldn't even tell the difference between the pork and the beef.  ...  ... As I said, the food came out fast, but why wouldn't it, when it was obvious all they had to do was scoop out a big ladleful of meat onto tortillas? Not exactly haute cuisine here. After we finished eating, we sat around for almost 15 minutes waiting for our bill, but the waitress was now MIA. I ended up going inside (we were on the patio) and asking the bartender for our bill. The waitress was at the server stand talking with another waitress and overheard me and I could see the look on her face of "Oh, yeah! These people wanted to get out of here in time for a show!" ...  ... I do not know what everyone else is eating here to give such glowing reviews. This has to be one of the worst Mexican meals I've ever had. No me gusta Mucho Gusto.
38	3	1	2	1	Surprised about all the talk regarding atmosphere.  All I got was the constant hum of traffic going up and down University.  Decent vibe and above average Mexican.  (Improve on the chips/salsa.  They seem very half-hearted.) ...  ... If I'm in the area come feeding time it is in the equation, otherwise probably not worth the effort.
38	5	0	0	0	This place is awesome. I actually worked there back in college, and having seen how the place operates, I know it's good. Everything is made fresh. Seriously. The syrup for the hibiscus margarita is made on premises with real hibiscus flowers. They even make their own mozarella, chorizo, chips, salsa.  The few things that they have to buy (like cotija cheese), are high quality.  My favorite item was chorizo and clams in an adobo broth with rosemary fry bread. It was so good, and 1/2 price during happy hour. The fish tacos with the pineapple salsa, jalapeno slaw and chipotle crema were sooooo delicious and the red chile pork ( super spicy) too. The maragaritas are great, made with fresh ingredients, and the owner and managers really love food and care about the quality of what's going out. The wine list is great and super affordable. The only thing I never really cared for was the shrimp cocktail- had a "ketchupy" taste to me, oh well. The enviroment is really relaxed, very much a neighborhood bar. As for the some of the negative reviews, much of the menu is designed to be similar to food you would find in Mexico City, not Filiberto's, so there are some things that would be considered unusual if you were looking for standard tex-mex. And as for service, I always thought that it was good. Bar service is probably best, b/c the bartender is always there. Most of the servers at any restaurant in Tempe are ASU students, so service is always going to be a little relaxed. All things considered, the food and drink are amazing. Oh and the patio is super romantic at night, with all of the lights, there's even a fireplace.
38	3	0	3	0	Mucho Gusto is like that girl who if she just put out a little more effort she would be the love of your life but she never does. Mucho Gusto has so much potential but zero consistency.  ...  ... Now I have gone here probably five times and have had different experiences every time. Sometimes I get great food and great service then other times, like when I went for lunch today, I walk away disappointed.  ...  ... Overall the food here is decent. I typically go with the Trio Chicken Tacos with a side salad. They are a good size that will fill you up without giving you that afternoon food coma. The only negative is sometimes the salsa is too runny which makes the tortillas soggy and kind of gross.  ...  ...  The atmosphere is decent. It does have a good patio when it's not to hot to sit outside. However sometimes they play the music so loud you feel like you're at Que Club on Mill. If you looking for decent Mexican food in Tempe Mucho Gusto is your spot.
38	4	0	0	0	We went here for one of our monthly lunch places.  Plenty of parking in the lots or on the streets.  We sat in on the patio.  It was nice weather and great service.  I ordered the chicken quesada (red peppers, chicken, bacon, & cheese).  It was huge.   1/2 of the order was good enough for me.  Good lunch!  YUM!
38	4	1	1	1	Who knew this was the cool hipster hang out?  Went there on a Friday night during a pseudo reverse happy hour for the Suns game.  We ended up getting five apps to split among four people.  Everything was delicious!  The machaca & cheese flautas were amazing.  We actually got one order then ended up ordering another after tasting them.  The fundido is equally delicious.  If you like guacamole, don't miss out on their version, which includes a jalapeno and Grand Marnier reduction.  Wow, so good!  Service was good.  Margaritas were strong.  And (best of all and of no relation to the restaurant whatsoever) the Suns won!
38	2	0	0	0	I was severely disappointed in this place. First of all, our waitress was absolutely horrible!!! She was so inattentive and it took forever to get things from her. Now on to the food... I ordered half ass burrito which is supposed to come loaded with rice,beans,pico,guacamole,cheese,and a choice of meat. My burrito had hardly ANYTHING in it. All the fillings were nonexistent except for the rice(which in itself was mediocre at best). I was so irritated at the lack of EVERYTHING in my burrito. I literally had two tiny pieces of meat in it. I didn't finish, and left hungry. To top it off, my food was lukewarm. I would definitely not go back here again. I didn't  want to make a fuss at the time because we were with some friends, but I should have sent it back.  The only good thing was the chips and salsa.
38	3	0	0	0	Good looking place.. have always wanted to check it out.  Finally stopped in... strong menu.  Wasn't too crazy about my shrimp quesadilla.  Not bad, just basically a cheese crisp with shrimp.  But the menu choices make me want to try again.
38	4	0	1	1	I've been told by others that this place is great. I was a bit worried about it not living up to the hype. This afternoon I got to try it for myself.  ... First off, this isn't a "typical" Mexican restaurant. You won't see rugs and sombrero's scattered on the walls or hear mariachi music. It has a nice warm feel, beautiful patio, and comfortable atmosphere. There are many options on the menu and in my option Mucho Gusto serves Mexican food with an edge. A great edge.  ... The salsa has a kick and the guacamole is by far one of the best I've had. I ordered 2 tacos (fish and carne asada). It was served with a side salad vs. beans and rice like most places. It was a nice and tasty touch and I left feeling good for eating my greens.  ... This is really a 4.5 star in my opinion and will most likely be a 5 star after I try more on the menu.
38	4	0	0	0	cool atmoshpere. very pleasant and relaxing. menu prices are higher. they averaged $12-$14 a person. the food was very good. they do a different take on mexican food and have many choices on their menu that are not the typical mexican dishes. they add seafood and you can immediately see and taste the quality of the food. i just thought it was pricey. they have a full bar with happy hour prices and a nice outdoor patio for sitting. if you want a very good and different mexican food experience, this is your place. however, it is more expensive then alot of mexican restaurants. they belong to restaurant.com, so you can get huge discounts on certificates for eating there. good all around place. i just didn't the like the more expensive pricing.
38	3	0	0	0	We were craving Mexican food and this place was close by and I had been wanting to try it.  ... Sitting on the patio is much nicer then inside, although there is the constant traffic noise.  ... I ordered the three enchiladas, chicken, pork, and cheese. The flavor was very standard considering the price. The Chicken was the best of the three. The cheese had no flavor at all.  ... Chris D. ordered the Gaucho tacos. They were really good! Beware of the strong garlic flavor that will make you wake up in the middle of the night to brush you teeth.  ... The chips and salsa are good. The service, however, was very inattentive.  ... Luckily we had a restaurant.com certificate. I would not dine here without some type of discount. It is just not worth the high prices for average Mexican food.
38	5	0	0	0	Great margaritas, good selection of tequilla, tasty fresh food and good abmiance
38	3	0	0	0	I always test Mexican restaurants by their guacamole. I'm happy to say that Mucho Gusto passed that test. It's delectable guacamole came topped with a Grand Marnier jalapeno reduction... delicious! ...  ... I ordered a chicken kabob-type dish (sorry, friends, I can't remember the official title). It was good. Not amazing. ...  ... Our waitress wasn't very attentive as our water glasses were never refilled. ...  ... All in all. The food was good, but I wasn't impressed by the service.
38	4	1	2	2	I dated a chef for five years.  I learned how to chop onions and find good places to eat and act smug when we got sent special food out.  About three years into our relationship she helped open up Much Gusto.  She was a "creative consultant" for the menu and our roommate was the restaurant manager.  We also knew the chef she was working with and I often recall this chef as I dine there, who once told me a story with his thick Mexican accent about doing shrooms in Mexico and then burning all of his pants.  She only helped open the place, working ridiculous hours for about a month, and then when the kitchen and menu were in order she moved on.  ...  ... Even after she moved on from the opening, Mucho was a go-to place for a while.  Out roommate ran the place so one holiday when the restaurant was closed we got to go in there and cook our holiday meal in their kitchen, partake in the bar goods and act like big shots having the place to ourselves.  I have a million memories of staying after hours around the fire, on the patio, drinking vodka tonics and talking about food and music and people.  These are fond memories, so perhaps my review of the place as a current dining experience might be biased.  But I don't care, I'll always love Mucho.  ...  ... This was many years ago, I believe the owner is the same but the menu has changed, the chef has changed and we've been broken up for many years; she slings food at FnB and I date boys now instead of girls.  What's odd though is that despite it being a spot which was a staple in my past life with her it has upheld the test of time and become one of the boyfriend and I's favorite places for good food and tasty margaritas.  ...  ... The best thing you can order at Mucho are the flautas.  These are absolutely perfect; juicy and spicy and perfect with this tangy, thick sauce that kills me every time.  We also never fail to order the Quaso, as melted cheese with tortillas are just perfect in making you feel fat but also releasing two millions endorphins.  Most times we visit Mucho we split an order of the Quaso and an order of flautas and it's the perfect amount of food.  The margaritas are always well prepared and it's worth it to have like four if you go for happy hour.  The salsa is actually spicy and the bus boys are way better at refilling your empty chip bowl than the servers.   ...  ... Another thing I love about Mucho is that they play good music.  It may seem menial, but the stupid mainstream bullshit music that makes its way into most upscale-yet-not-fine-dining places is repetitive, crappy and mostly annoying.  I've heard Mucho play some bands I wouldn't normally expect to hear in such a place, and am always surprised and pleased by it.  As in, "holy shit they're playing old school Modest Mouse.  Weird." ...  ... The only complaint I have about Mucho is, of course, the service.  It's true what the other reviewers say, the service is slow, all the hot chicks that work there seem a little dumb, and you always have to wait forever for more drinks and sometimes they just plain forget.  Usually when we go to Mucho we're planning on hanging out for a while so it's not such a huge deal to wait, but I can understand how it gets annoying.   ...  ... They need to stop hiring hot chicks and hire some smart people instead.  ...  ... Recently, I went to Mucho for my 25th birthday, probably about five years after my first visit to the opening, and ate on the patio with a couple of close friends and partook in a cozy and memorable dining experience.  But like I said before, I'm biased.
38	3	1	1	0	If you could give 2.5 stars for this place I would since it was exactly mediocre. Some things good, some things bad. We walked in on a Thursday night and there were a couple people outside (even though it was in the 40s, 50s) and approximately 3 people inside. Very quiet. There was also no music playing, so it added to the quietness. Later, we heard some clicks and an ipod came on with some random selections and then the rest of the night there were the sounds of their computer restarting on their stereo system. A couple people at the bar also, and some guy on his computer there. We ordered a couple drinks as it was $3 wine night, which we liked. They had some selections of good wines too for the 'house' wines..i.e. viognier for $3. Took forever to come and the waiter was downright bizarre. Kept mispronouncing food on purpose and then cackling wildly about a joke he had made. Guacamole was good, if salty, but I like salty. The Grand Marnier on it added a nice touch. Main courses came out before we were even half done with the appetizer which I find intensely annoying. Husband had a shrimp dish which tasted like some watery, frozen shrimp had been put in the microwave and doused with some A1 and Swiss Miss. Shrimp burrito was good though, and huge. We had a gift certificate there, and if we didn't, it definitely wouldn't have been worth the price. Would maybe go back and just have a burrito and sit outside when the weather's nice, but overall a pretty mixed experience. Go at your own risk!
38	1	0	2	0	I was in town for a conference last year. After growing mighty weary of the hotel fare we decided to go here for dinner. The service and the food were excellent. ...  ... *blank stare* ...  ... This was a year ago ...  ... In town again for the same conference and I must tell you that I found it hard to believe that this was the same restaurant. We came here for lunch and we had a rather snarky waiter who decided to pick and choose who at the table to be civil to. After my friend asked the waiter if they had fajitas he replied no and said "Lo siento sister".  ...  ... Huh? WTF? I'm sure that's cool at the bar with your friends but you don't know us. Keep it professional. Okay one small infraction I'm willing to let go. But this waiter kept on being a smart ass and picking on my friend. "I didn't eat the last batch or write the menu" ...  ... WTH? ...  ... Ordinarily I would have alerted the Manager or got up and walked out but at that point I was ready to leave but I was hungry and our food was on its way. Also being there with a bunch of people I didn't want to look like an asshole. Our waiter, apparently had no problem with that.  ...  ...  ... The food this go around? Not so much. Just ok.  ...  ... I won't be back.
38	3	0	1	0	This is a tough review to write, because I've loved this place forever, but something's going on recently, and not for the better. It's still good, and I'd still recommend it, but it's on the decline. New management? ...  ... I've been going here for a few years, probably a dozen times total over three years. Early on, it was an amazing find for Tempe: An inventive Mexican menu, with fresh ingredients well prepared, in a cool Southwestern space. ...  ... Unfortunately, this year my visits have included a number of red flags. First, they got rid of their heat lamps - so what could be, and used to be, an awesome patio environment was just DEAD through most of the winter. When we braved the outside one evening anyway, we sat by the (dead gas) fire and had to ask for it to be turned on. ??? ...  ... The service, while not bad, has just lacked something in recent months. Energy? Engagement? We get seated. We order. We get our food. We pay the check. We leave. We were there last week - forced to sit inside because of the lack of heat lamps - and were told to sit at the bar to wait for a table. We sat at the bar using the three open seats, and the bartender promptly told us we couldn't sit there because we were blocking the bar. When the server had just seated us there??? We had had enough but the hostess caught us on our way out because a table had just opened. ...  ... Some bright spots remain: half price drinks and apps during happy hour, cool outdoor patio when it's warm, and a menu refresh that includes skewers that are really, really good. Also try the Green Chile Nachos. ...  ... This was a five start place at one time, was a four even in recent years, but is now a three, and it's slide may not be over. Breaks my heart...
38	4	0	1	1	I don't know what all the complaining about the service is about, but we had excellent service at the bar. Margarita coupon on their website and it was a good even blend. I had the enchiladas, which came three on a plate and chose one of each: chicken, pork, cheese. Talk about perfect portions - they were not too big, not too small, perfect amount of zesty red sauce, thick and chewy tortillas, and came with delicious beans and a scoop of rice. There are other dinners on the menu that I am very interested in trying (garlic shrimp, anyone?). It's a nice, cozy spot, good for small groups of friends or a date.
38	1	0	1	0	Poor service, mediocre food, and quite frankly Southwest Airlines makes a better margarita!  Avoid Mucho Gusto!
38	5	0	1	0	I loved this little spot!! me and the bf drive by all the time and decided to give it a try, on our way there I was reading the yelp reviews and got a little nervous....everyone seemed so "just okay" about it, but thankfully they were wrong!   ...  ... we dove right into the chips and salsa which were so tasty- I loved that they had a little bit of a kick to the salsa and you can usually tell how the food is going to be just by trying the chips and salsa.  we ordered the guacamole---OMG so freakin' good you have to try this stuff, save a bit to put on your entrees (you'll thank me later)  ... we ordered the carne asada tacos and the carnitas flautas and shared with each other-best idea :) dipping them in the guac was so divine I could have bathed in it ;) haha ... I also ordered a margarita which was so good!!  I like mine a little more sour than sweet and without even mentioning it to the server it came out so perfect...they had a good little kick to-if you know what I mean-so spending $6 didn't really matter to me :)  ...  ... definintely affordable our dinner came to like $43 which wasn't bad at all if you ask me...go try this place, the service was great, ambiance was fun and it was busy all evening so you get that high energy feeling too!!
38	4	0	0	0	If you were looking for an actual review of Mucho Gusto, then you might want to select one of the other 68 reviews that are currently on Yelp.  Spoiler alert, this review will have very little to do with Mucho Gusto.  Now, if you are looking for the perfectly place to (1) have a book club meeting, (2) you are brining your 5 year old daughter, and (3) the book is True Grit, then look no further than Mucho Gusto.  I guess I should add that my book club friends tell me that the third point is a little thin, but two out of three isn't bad.  In my defense, True Grit is a western, and don't all westerns occur in Arizona.  And then when the white hats settle down they move to California because Florida was too far away.  Of course, now you might say, "Wait a second, isn't Mucho Gusto a Mexican restaurant."  Well, isn't Mexico part of the West, by which I mean, isn't it part of the Western Genre?  In conclusion, the atmosphere is great, you can eat outside, and sometimes the floor is a little slippery. ...  ... This review is dedicated to all of the book clubs who have ever had a meeting at Mucho Gusto with or without a five year old.
38	2	1	1	1	Food is mediocre.  Service is terrible.  They do have Negra Modelo on tap, but nothing else is worthwhile.  They also won't split checks for groups bigger than 3.  That's just lazy.  Go somewhere else.
38	4	0	0	0	First I love their chips and salsa, they have just enough heat to necessitate a delicious margarita.  We then usually try the mexican pizza or the pork picaditas.  The rest of their menus is great too, we just come for happy hour typically.
38	2	0	1	0	Sadly, I didn't read the reviews before finally going here. It seems the only thing Mucho Gusto is good for is happy hour & I didn't really think those prices were all that amazing. I've never felt so ripped off by a Mexican food place before. I got the Machaco Tacos. Two tacos for $10, I figured it'd come with lettuce, sour cream, & definately some beans &/or rice on the side. What I got were tiny soft shells(I thought corn might be crispy, my bad) with a ton of VERY bland & somewhat dry meat & a slice(yeah, I said SLICE) of cheese. The only other taco I've ever seen in my life with a slice of cheese is at Jack in the Box. The side was a small cup of tortilla soup that came out with the meal. The soup & atmoshere were the only redeeming qualities. Even the picante sauce they called salsa for the chips was thin & lacking. My friend ordered the shrimp tacos(2 for $14) & the "large shrimp" were small to medium sized frozen shrimp(about 4 on each taco) & dry. Even the service fell flat. Our waiter was brief with us, no smile, no chit-chat or other suggestions & after the food came, he didn't come back until we were completely done choking it all down. The busboy(or whatever he was), although not dressed at all professionally, was prompt & seemed friendly. Had I known what it'd be like, I would've much rather gone to Chipotle where it would be half the price, delicious/flavorful & much more friendly(not to mention they have the same beer). I work at a local hotel & recommended this place to several guests in the past(mainly because of the location & atmoshere) but now I'm embarrassed & I won't send anyone else. Sorry, but this one's a stinker. Try Macayos for margaritas or Rositas for a full menu that's always good.
38	4	0	0	0	I eat at Mucho Gusto quite often with clients/potential clients. The lunch menu is very reasonably priced and has a great selection. I really like the chips and salsa delivered while you wait. I gave this a 4/5 because the wait is longer than normal once you put in your order. Other than that, it's great!
38	1	0	3	0	I went with a party of 5 and we split the bill among credit cards/cash.  The waiter (Michael P) overcharged the credit cards and said it was due to the original receipt not reflecting our drink prices.  I insisted that he print out the original receipt since I needed it for company expense tracking and sure enough, homeboy pocketed the cash and overcharged us in order to get a bigger tip!  The food is ok but not really worth the price plus I refuse to go back due to Michael P pulling a fast one on us.
38	4	0	0	0	Enjoyed sitting outside and the barra viejo shrimp dish.  I didn't find anything "to die for" but it's good.  More importantly it was a nice evening and I enjoyed the experience very much.  My waiter was very laid back and friendly.  I didn't feel rushed and was able to have a relaxed dinner.  Case in point- I'm usually a one-drink girl, but I had 2 that day.
38	2	0	1	0	This place looks the part. Great decor. The food is Macayo's level. Just add $2-$4 per item. A Chimichanga for $14! Even with rice and beans...I can get a number of Chimicangas for $8-$9 that taste at least as good as this one... ...  ... I don't really know the draw to this place. The staff is really cool, its just too expensive! Especially for Mexican!

Upon presenting our certificate, we were told it was only valid on Mon-Wed. However, these conditions are stated nowhere on the certificate. So then we were informed the manager is discontinuing this program, yet, we just bought the certificate a few weeks ago? We asked to speak to the manager, who was not there, so the assistant manager agreed to honor our certificate. Other than this hassle, the place was quaint with a lovely patio and we did enjoy the food. The steak tacos had a great flavor and we loved the spiciness of the salsa.  Due to the asst. manager honoring our certificate, we will give this place another try.

That's why my dad hates it - it's too cutesy/nouveau for his palate. That has nothing to do with my review. Just saying as a warning.  ...  ... Pros: Husband and I have been coming here on and off for years. It has had its ups and downs, but in our experience it's been worth returning to. It's not the run of the mill Mexican, as I said, which makes a nice change. Agree that the service tends to be slow, but have never been subjected to anything but politeness, and they have been accommodating when we've wanted to substitute a side or whatnot. Margaritas are excellent. Tea is good. Love the decor and the patio in nice weather. I adore their chicken enchiladas and their rice is awesome. Husband has pretty much liked anything he's ordered off the menu. LOVE their salsa. ...  ... Cons: I never have liked the 'we have to charge you for more than the first bowl of chips' thing. Come on... seriously? Again, slow service, which you have to ding them for, because they're slow even when you and only two other tables are there at an off-time, and it has nothing to do with the kitchen. They need to start maintaining some of the patio, it's starting to look ignored/worn.  ...  ... Overall, we keep coming back when we want a break from the usual. We think it's worth it.

38	4	0	0	0	Very cool ambiance, we take office visitors to da Mucho all de time. Not many places you can hit during the day and hear a Band of Gypsies while you eat. I get the half-ass burrito, which is HUGE. A nice blend of rice, machaca, refried into beans. I can't even imagine how big the big-ass burritos is. Cool, attentive staff too.
38	5	0	0	0	What a pleasant surprise!  We live in Cave Creek, so not much time spent in Tempe.  My wife and I had business in Tempe this morning, and at 11am decided to grab lunch.  Across the street is Mucho Gusto.  Very good food, very attentive service, and pretty cool decor.  Fish tacos and chile rellenos were tremendous.  With the ceiling fans running inside, it was very comfortable for a 105 day, and with the little beehive fireplaces and chimineas, I bet it would be great for the cooler weather, as well.
38	5	0	1	0	It's been awhile since I've eaten here.  I used to work just a mile down University and I'd eat the shrimp tacos at least once a week.  I loved this place because it was not standard mexican food.  They put some extra care into what they servce.  The tacos were like like little shrimp salads on a tortilla.  I usually dissected and them and savored every bite individually.   ...  ... The chips and salsa are pretty good too.  Again, they don't taste like all the other places. ...  ... I think the atmosphere is pretty nice here, a little loud on the inside, but awesome on the patio when the weather's right.  Note that I've only been here for lunch, so I cannot comment on the nighttime atmosphere. ...  ... Love this place.  I miss being near it.
38	5	0	0	0	Absolutely delicious! I used to go for lunch all the time, the burritos rock my face off. I haven't been at night, but I'd imagine that the ambiance and the margaritas would make for a spectacular experience. Go!! You won't regret it :)
38	4	0	0	0	Love this place, great happy hour, good price on food and drinks. Good to start or finish a night out on mill here. good staff and decor.
38	3	0	0	0	Must try the fish tacos and the salad. I don't care for the rest of the food. The place is casual, you can sit outdoors, and people are friendly and can get you out of there on time. Good place for lunch.
38	4	0	0	0	I used to have to wine and dine customers and would always take them to Mucho Gusto.The food is a fancy twist on traditional Mexican food and the quality is amazing. The only reason I gave 4/5 is because the service is kind of slow. I would recommend for sure.

38	1	2	3	0	I don't think I have ever been to a restaurant where I have treated so poorly by the wait staff. I'm actually rethinking my Green rating because I sincerely think this is my worst restaurant experience. ...  ... The one good thing I can write is that this place is really cute and it has an inviting patio. Lots of string lights and cute bistro tables. I really thought I was in for a great evening. Oh how wrong I was. ...  ... My friend and I walked in and the hostess immediately sat us at a four top right in front of the door. Unless the restaurant is packed and the drafty table in front of the door is the last spot available, I do not want to sit in a place where incoming guests will constantly bump into my chair. I pointed to a seat in the back and after trying to convince me I didn't want *that* table, the hostess led us to the back. It's not the worst thing that could ever happen and that instance did not ruin my evening, it was just weird. ...  ... We sat and were greeted by our waitress, who initially seemed very nice. We both ordered water to start and I asked her for a drink menu. Apparently the drink menu is on the back of the regular menu. It's just so small that I missed it the first time. She told me that Friday night is the $4 frozen house margarita night, so I went with her suggestion. By the time I finish pulling out my ID, my dining partner was ready to order. We got a queso appetizer, the vegetarian tacos with a side salad, and the machaca plate. ...  ... While we waited, a few more groups came in, were greeted, and received their adult beverages. It had been ten minutes since I ordered my drink, so I tried to look for our waitress.  ...  ... She finally popped up five minutes later, but avoided all eye contact with our table. When she did see me, she quickly ran outside. I understand she might have had a few tables outside, but why have an inside section to wait as well? The table right next to us had an amazing server who brought them two orders of drinks in the time it took to get my water glass refilled. (Margarita was still MIA at this point.) ...  ... Then, the queso came out, brought by two hipsters. It looked like an over-microwaved styrofoam plate in a skillet and tasted just as bad. My friend tried to make the best out of the situation, but I was ready to call the manager. I really, really regret that I did not.  ...  ... Nasty queso juice dripped all over the table and there was no silverware or napkins to be found. AND no wait persons or a hostess to ask for said items. (Twenty minutes after I ordered my margarita, it was still MIA.) ...  ... Our waitress finally popped up and asked how the appetizer was. My friend cut me off and said it was different, but okay. He took rare this opportunity to ask for silverware. The waitress made an excuse that it should have been on the table already and went to grab some.  When she came back, I asked about my drink. ...  ... With another lame excuse that could have been avoided if she ever check on us in the then-thirty minute absence, she finally brought me my drink. It was OKAY, not worth $4... more like $2-3.  ...  ... Two seconds later, the food came out. At least we had silverware? ...  ... 1) My veggie tacos and side salad were okay. Is it bad that the BEST part of meal was the white, iceberg lettuce salad? ... 2) My friend's machaca was bone dry. Isn't machaca supposed to be tender, rehydrated, and edible?  ...  ... All in all, the salsa was the best part of the meal. Yet, one cannot enjoy a dining experience on salsa alone. This was sincerely my worst experience at a restaurant and I will not go back to Mucho Gusto.
38	5	0	0	0	I've only been to Mucho Gusto twice, once in 2008 and most recently this past weekend and both times I have been completely blown away by the service! I am a restaurant manager and both times I've visited I have wanted to hire my server on the spot! Very friendly and attentive, funny too! The patio area is great when the weather isn't too hot!  ...  ... The food is good but it's the service for me that will get to go back the next time I'm in town!!
38	1	1	1	0	Este es comida horrible! The Very best in Modern mexican food?? What the cuss? Really? Who says? Not this this guy? What idiot box is running this joint? Someone from the midwest with no tastebuds who watched too much Rick Bayless on PBS and decided to open a restaurant in the re-invent yourself capitol of the world??!  ...  ... Well lets start with the hostess. Too cool for school chick, no personality and playing with her iPhone at the podium! She did not smile, did not care that we were even there, more worried about her texts that greeting us and sitting us. I m sure she is missing out on something with all her yahoo friends!  ... Now, on to the service. not great. Waitress was typical college kid with no real serving experience or at least she was not very good at it. Did not check on us much but was not all that horrible. Just so-so. ... Now on the food. Lord. Seriously people? You guys are giving this place 3,4-5 stars? ... I ordered the Machaca taco's Oops I mean the American stew taco's! Gross! They were the farthest away from Machaca I have ever had. Where's the onions? And what the hell is this light green crap on top? That is NO WAY a guacamole sauce!!! Give me a break! I have had the real thing in Mexico DF or Baja. That stuff was tasteless green crap! That is there way of cutting corners and not using real avocado for REAL guacamole or guacamole sauce. The menu says served with guacamole! Ahh no it's not!! I tasted this stuff and it tastes more like creamy cucumber dressing but with 0 flavor.  ... The Salsa was not great either. It was sort of like they added chipotle to canned stewed tomatoes in its own sauce and served it up! The chips were cold and we got all the pieces from the bottom. Sorry but I don't want the chips that have been sitting there for an hour and all broken. Get me a fresh batch bitches!!! Is it that hard? Common sense people, my god!  ... Wife had the shrimp taco's, not horrible but nothing great. I would not go here again. We left with a bill for $37 for the 4 tacos and a salad on each plate plus a glass of wine and beer. OUCH!  ... I like the decor but this is far from good mexican or even mexican fusion!  ... I think they really need to work on their service and employees, and most certainly their food. Spend some money on good product and spend some time on perfecting your recipes. Maybe you need to go out and taste some real mexican food....IN mexico, come back and start over. I will not be coming back to this place for sure, even though it is close to my house. I rather go to...Oh man should I say it...ok Rosita's!!  Heck Chipotle down the street would actually have been more satisfying.  ... I say pass on this one. Not worth the money.
38	2	0	0	0	This is a mixed review for me because I love the ambiance of Mucho Gusto, the staff is really nice, and the orange jalapeno margarita is amazing. ...  ... The food however, I was not all that impressed with. We ordered the skewers - mushroom, pork and chicken and we were not blown away with any of it. Maybe I will go back and try their tacos, but I am thinking I will keep it as a good place to sit on the patio, eat chips & salsa and drink a good margarita or two. I am not into "modern" Mexican food (whatever that means) - I like authentic Mexican food!
38	4	0	0	0	Food has always been very tasty here. The mashed potatoes are unique and tasty and mostly all dishes I have had we're good. The one I recall being a bit less in quality were the steak nachos and not because it lacked flavor or quantity, just a bit of a grizzle problem on the steak.  ...  ... The patio here is one of the best in my opinion. Cozy with a fireplace and lots of fun lights. Great for an afternoon with margaritas! ...  ... Oh if u are a chips and salsa lover it is very tasty (and somewhat spicy) here.  ...  ... Only reason I gave it four stars vs five is that they have a lack of desire to run their air conditioning until it is absolutely necessary which can leave it a little warm for some inside.
38	1	0	1	0	I went with my wife on Friday evening at 8.  The restaurant was probably about 2/3 filled but not hopping.  We asked to sit outside on the gorgeous patio.  It really is a beautiful place to dine.  After a minute or two the busboy/server brought us out chips and salsa. They were pretty darn good.  Then... nothing.  We were ready to order our entrees, but nobody had even passed by to take our drink order.  One waiter kept coming out and conversing with his buddies at a table near us.  Another waitress seated an older couple 5 minutes after us.  While we desperately tried to get someone`s attention, that couple was brought out their drinks.  10 minutes slowly dripped into 15.  Finally, we simply walked out. ...  ... I get overworked waitstaff, and can have patience  with that, but this was ridiculous for a half-full restaurant, with at least 3 waiters working the patio area.
38	3	0	1	0	Another restaurant that hasn't kept up with it's original concept.  They used to be really creative and spicy.  Seems to be americanized now. ... Taco plate looked like an appetizer and the best appetizer was melted cheese.  They used to have a mussel appetizer in a mole sauce with fry bread.  That was worth the trip. ... It's such a small place you would think the service would be better.  They need to get back to their roots to make it.
38	4	0	0	0	While on business to Phoenix I stopped here to grab a bite. This place SCREAMS friendly and local! Everyone was so nice and attentive. The food was yummy and I was able to get in and out in about 35 minutes. PERFECTION. I'll be back and soon.
38	3	0	1	0	We loved our food. It was delicious. My only complaint was that the music was so loud that we couldn't speak to each other (there were 3 in our party). And it was 2 pm on a Thursday. The place wasn't jammed packed with people ready to party. So, I'm not quite sure why the music was so loud.
38	5	0	0	0	Mucho Gusto has the Best Fish Tacos in town!!! From the moment you are greateted at the door you can feel the lively energy that radiates from this place. Great tunes & great ambiance with a friendly & hip staff! If you need a thirst quencher for the Hot summer, Mucho Gusto has the most delicious Margaritas & Iced Tea to cool you off!! I will for sure be returning to this place soon to get my fish taco fix!
38	4	1	2	0	If you're a hipster looking for a Mexican food restaurant in Tempe, Mucho Gusto would be happy to meet you. ...  ... The pretty spot is staffed with vintage-wearing, young servers and hosts, and when I went there, I really liked the relaxed, laid-back vibe (and the food.) ...  ... The spot has a pretty patio with twinkly lights and a fireplace, and the inside restaurant is dimly lit, warm and cozy. ...  ... To start, I had a yummy Mexican pizza appetizer ($7), made with fry bread, black beans and cheese. It was the perfect portion for two people, or for one person's meal. I thought the fry bread was an interesting choice and gave it a nice doughy texture that was a surprise. ...  ... For my entree, I had cheese enchiladas ($14). They came with black beans and rice, and though I usually prefer refried beans, I actually really liked the smoky flavor of the black beans and thought they went great with the meal. They were the same ones found on the pizza, and I guess I just couldn't get enough. ...  ... The cheese enchiladas were super-stuffed with cheese, and it was too big of a meal for me to finish-something that's rare. While there are tons of fast-food Mexican joints, I'd go back to Mucho Gusto for the cute ambiance and filling portions.
38	5	0	0	0	Wow! Had so much fun here. Very cute restaurant and the patio is such a cool place to hang out on when the weather is nice.  ... We had the Clams in the Mole Chorizo Sauce. Best clams I have had. The spicy flavor combined with their awesome mole was incredible! What a great idea! ... Chips and salsa were ridiculously good. So important to have a tasty salsa. ... The staff was very kind and knowledgeable about the food. ... Can't wait to go Back! ... -Mike
38	4	0	0	0	Mucho gusto is probably one of my favorite lunch restaurants.  The patio is very charming and just lovely to sit on when the weather is nice. I love the tacos they serve here, and the margaritas are strong:)  I recommend coming here only for lunch; dinner portions are the exact same size but more expensive (a little bit of a rip off in my opinion).  Overall this place is nice for a good lunch and conversation.
38	1	0	0	0	I had an absolutely nauseating experience at Mucho Gusto.  I dined there a couple of years ago and had a pleasant experience, so I was pretty confident a repeat visit would be the same.  I was wrong.  The waitress was very rushed and seemed like she had some other place she wanted or needed to be.  The posole my boyfriend ordered was not even lukewarm.  When he asked if it was supposed to be cold, she just hurried away and sometime later plopped a new one down in front of him.  The worst part of the evening is when I pulled a huge, red hair out of my mouth that had been mixed up in my salad.  I called the rushed waitress over and showed her what I had pulled out of my mouth.  She simply grabbed the plate, hurried off and plopped a new salad down in front of me.  I then stopped her and explained I had completely lost my appetite and asked her to take the food.  She returned, dropped the check and said "It's half off" and hurried away again.  Feeling like they were trying to dismiss the situation and not actually correct it, I asked for the manager.  He simply reiterated that he had taken fifty percent off of our bill.  I couldn't believe this was considered a satisfactory solution to such a disgusting mistake on their part.  I think if you're sickened by an experience due to the restaurant's negligence, you shouldn't have to pay for that repulsive experience.  I will not be returning to Mucho Gusto a third time.
38	5	0	0	0	I eat here frequently for lunch and dinner.  My office will sometimes drop by as well for some food.  Very nice waiters/waitresses and great food!  Wonderful place to drop by for a quick bite, if you want amazing food. ...  ... Their drinks are awesome to, just drank some of their Margarita's tonight and tasted their Sangria.  Well worth it!  Keep it up Mucho!
38	4	0	2	0	Was out in Tempe for a conference and wanted to find some Mexican close to our hotel. We found this place. We got the guacamole which was awesome, they put some jalapeno sauce around the edge which was might tasty.  ...  ... Portions weren't that big, but prices were reasonable. Service was great, and would definitely come back next time I was in Tempe.
38	5	0	0	0	I absolutely LOVE Mucho Gusto.   ...  ... Came here for my first time on a Friday night to get some drinks with friends.  The Margaritas sold me instantly.  I went a while ago, but the happy hour special for that day (they have different specials based on the day, Saturday is 1/2 price Marg pitchers!) was $5 a Margarita.  They are so good!  They're homemade and don't have that nasty artificial taste.  Not too sweet either.  A friend ended up ordering dessert and she got this delicious flautas dish with vanilla ice cream and berry sauce.  SO GOOD!   ...  ... The dessert and drinks alone captured my interest, so when some out of town family from back East came for a visit, I suggested Mucho Gusto to get some local flavor.  They're not really used to Mexican flavors because there is limited exposure where they're from in NY, but they enjoyed their meals and LOVED the Margs.   ...  ... Kudos to me for introducing them to new food, and kudos to Mucho Gusto on great service, food, and atmosphere!
38	4	0	1	0	Love this place.  Great food...a cut above the average Mexican food.  Really nice courtyard for eating outside during good weather.  Good margaritas too.  I highly recommend it for those who've grown tired of the typical large or smaller chain Mexican restaurants.
38	5	0	0	0	Love this place! I have never had a bad service experience and my food has always been delish! I love their fresh margs and the guacamole is amazing. It's never too busy, especially in the evenings, and the atmosphere is really laid back.  ...  ... The only complaint I have ever had was when the guy at the table next to us asked me if my margarita was as terrible as his. Apparently he couldn't taste any tequila at all but then I learned that his favorite spot for margs is Chili's so I think what he was missing was the flavor of sugar-infused margarita mix?!
38	4	0	0	0	I like most of the food here. We've been 3 or 4 times. I love the guacomole, but I will say some of my favorite mexican food options aren't on the menu. Prices are kinda high and service is hit or miss. I've definitely had better Mexican food, but we've obviously been back more than once.... so overall, good food.
38	3	0	0	0	Just had lunch here today... place was pretty empty so we sat in the sun on the patio.  chips and salsa were pretty good... salsa was somewhat lacking in flavor, but probably perfectly seasoned for the occasional Mexican food consumer... ordered their half ass burrito with the 'spicy' red chili carnitas, very tasty burrito, not to hot.  I would defiantly go back and try some other offerings. great value!
38	5	1	1	1	Awesome guacamole.
38	4	0	3	0	After a coworker recommended this place I decided to give it a try while I was in town.    When I arrived I was promptly greeted at the door.  I decided to sit at the bar since I was eating by myself and the place was pretty empty.  It is a nice little place with a metal top bar. ...  ... First they brought me chips and salsa.  The salsa was awesome.  It was packed with flavor and a little heat.  I decided to order the red chile enchiladas with pork.  It was absolutely delicious. The staff were very friendly and attentive. I wish we had  real Mexican food like this in the Midwest.   ...  ... They also have authentic Mexican beers on tap.  While I didn't have any on this visit the selection looked pretty good.   ...  ... I wish I had known about this place before.  I  had great food and a great experience.  I will definitely be back the next time I'm in town.
38	4	0	0	0	Everything here is great except the food which is good enough.  I love the ambiance, the service, the margaritas, the chips, the guac.  I have been here 3 times and will keep coming back.

38	4	0	0	0	The food is great and the drinks are strong, two drinks and you are feeling happy.
38	2	0	0	0	Unfortunately, I was not impressed with this restaurant. The menu was not very appealing, the food we did order was just okay, and the service wasn't anything to write home about. If you want to enjoy some Mexican fare, this would not be my first choice.
38	2	0	0	0	Let me explain why they get the two stars- Small environment, but it looks nice and had creativity and thought put into it. Another star for the service we had. Our waiter, Frank, did a nice job and was very friendly.  ...  ... **Now for the food. This place is not authentic. The salsa did not taste like fresh salsa. More as something out of a can. The re-fried beans I had, same thing. I had ordered a chimichanga and it was very mediocre. Left overs the day after weren't too bad. My boyfriend had a shrimp burrito and said it was very mediocre as well. Not to mention, he paid $3 for ONE glass of Horchata that was mostly water with a bit of cinnamon. He was given water after. Again, like it was a pre-made mix or something.  ...  ... TOO PRICEY. My chimichanga, "spanish" rice, terrible refried beans was $16. I could have had authentic for almost half that. The shrimp burrito was $18, I believe.  ...  ... I love my Mexican food, and I know it's easier to find better and tastier places around here.
38	4	0	0	0	One of my all time favorite lunch spots . . . it was time to stop in again with a client who was looking for somethiing a little different. ...  ... I ordered the Mexican Pizza . . . the flat bread was hot and fresh, the beans were warm and tender, the lettuce was crispy, and the marinated chicken was just perfect. ...  ... The only issue was we seemed to be lost . . . the waiter did stop back several times . . . but usually when the drinks had been empty for a while. ...  ... Definitely have missed having lunch here and I will be back sooner than later.
38	5	0	0	0	This place is currently one of my favorite Mexican places.  I love that the dishes are fresh and not fried to death like some Mexican restaurants.  The lunch specials are really good deals.  The patio is perfect for dining is good weather.
38	3	0	0	0	Finally tried Mucho Gusto after years of driving by it to head to Oregano's or Mill Ave. and I was both impressed and disappointed with my experience. ...  ... I ate lunch here with my girlfriend and found the place mostly empty, with a few tables populated on the patio and some bar patrons.  We sat on the patio and were greeted with chips and salsa pretty quickly and got our food super-fast after we ordered, which was great.  The food was way better than I expected for the price paid, we received generous portions, and I was really intrigued and satisfied with their neo-Mexican cuisine.  Definitely not the place to hit up for authentico dining, but for a delicious new concept on traditional favorites, this is the place. ...  ... The downside of our trip was the service toward the tail end of our lunch.  We appeared to have been forgotten by our waiter several times and had to flag him down among the five other tables seated on the patio.  When we finally got our check, we had to wait 15 minutes, before we got up and walked inside to correct our bill (we were charged $1 more for an item than was listed on the menu), and pay.  We got a quick, "sorry about that," and were sent on our way.  ...  ... I'm seriously debating giving this place a second chance, even with their killer food.  I hope that today's experience was not representative of what they consider service to be, otherwise, I guess I'll have to leave Mucho Gusto to the college students....
38	4	1	2	2	I went to ASU for my undergrad and have eaten at Oregano's MANY times, yet I never noticed this place right next door! ...  ... I ate dinner here on Friday night about 8 pm. The restaurant seemed pretty empty inside and the patio was only about 60% full so there was no wait for a table. I enjoyed the chips and salsa they provide. For my entree I ordered the gaucho steak tacos with a chopped salad as my side. The chopped salad was pretty good - just your standard iceberg lettuce with some tortilla strips and an avocado slice on top.  The tacos were better and had lots of guacamole on top which I loved!  My only complaint was the steak was a little tough and stringy (got caught in my teeth a lot).  ...  ... It was a nice, quiet, laidback place to enjoy a relaxed meal of above average quality food. I would come here again!
38	4	0	1	1	Tasty good stuff!  Portions large enough two can share an appetizer and leave happy campers.  Margaritas are great and the guacamole is to die for.  Salsa has a strange flavor I was not a fan of but my boyfriend loved it. ...  ... Staff is nice and really fun.  If you are looking for some unique Mexican food in Tempe Mucho Gusto is muy bien.
38	4	0	1	1	I'm from Mexico where real Cochinita Pibil is from. Not gonna lie - it's pretty damn good. MG is pretty eccentric with it's guacamole (not a huge fan) but i somehow keep eating it. Don't ask... Anyhow, awesome patio off University and friendly service. Glad to have a place like this in Tempe.
38	4	0	0	0	Whoa... everything I had was delicious! Quesadilla with red chile pork was possibly the best quesadilla I've ever had. The red chile pork is amazingly delicous! That tortilla soup had depth in flavors like none other. And the margarita whipped up by bartender Ally was a great balance of citrus and tequila.  On a second visit, just this last weekend, I could not tear myself from the red chile pork... However, I did mix it up and get a fish taco in addition to the red chile pork taco for lunch.  Side note: At lunch, you can mix and match your tacos with either two or three selections!  The fish taco was good, but does not even come close to comparing to that red chile pork.... I could go on for days about it's deliciousness.  But I won't.  Go taste it yourself, and save some for me!!  ...  ... **IMPORTANT** On Saturdays they have an all day special on carafes of margaritas for $12 and carafes of sangria for $15.  Again, just save some for me!
38	4	0	4	1	As long as I've been in Tempe, I have driven past Mucho Gusto and never gave it that much thought. Grabbed dinner here with the boy over the weekend at his suggestion and headed on over. I really like the atmosphere, nicely light, warm, buzzword buzzword. We were seated right away and were brought out waters and chips and salsa to start. The salsa is okay - didn't seem homemade but whatever.  ...  ... I had the mucho gusto burrito with chicken and the side soup. Their tortilla soup is different. Good, but different. The burrito was really good. The tortilla got a little soggy but otherwise I was pleased with the filling and took half of it home for later (it's huge). Our server was great and I'll probably return.

38	4	0	2	3	As usual I always get the same thing....NOT TODAY! ...  ... I ordered one of their salads instead of the (grilled) fish tacos, which I love.  I was not disappointed though.  Their salad was fresh, plentiful and a perfect blend of different greens, tomatoes, avocado and a nice skewer of chicken breast. ...  ... If I were to make a recommendation I would just tell them to not overcook the chicken.  It was borderline dry and crispy.  Dressing came on the side as I requested and it was delicious as well. ...  ... Great service and friendly staff. ... Thanks Mucho Gusto!
38	4	0	0	0	Mucho Gusto has a yummy sangria... Whenever my friends are in town we usually sit down and have a pitcher or two :) ...  ... Their carne asada tacos are really good ...  ... The tortilla soup is a little on the spicy side ...  ... Chips and salsa are yummy too ...  ... I just don't like how loud it gets in here sometimes
38	5	0	0	1	I frequent this fine restaurant and have always found the food and service to be above reproach. Today they outdid themselves, delivering my lunch order by hand even though that's not a service they offer. The bartender (Lorne) knew I was short staffed at my work and took the time to bring my phone order to me at my nearby business without asking! This is the kind of service that makes this restaurant really great.
38	4	0	0	0	I've been here twice and just simply love it. My first time coming here was random, I had originally intended to go to Oregano's but when their wait was over an hour, I figured "Hey, why not?". Best decision ever. Their food is delicious and fresh, and the service is great. The prices aren't the cheapest, but it's certainly not expensive. I love the outdoor patio! I would recommend their guacamole (drizzled with agave syrup!), fish tacos, and the sangria. I will definitely keep coming back! ...  ... The only reason this isn't 5 stars, is because I've only been here a coupe of times. Will update the more I go.
38	4	0	0	0	Great fish tacos, guacamole, and Sangria.  Lots of easy parking. Friendly staff and good atmosphere. Would recommend. Prices are good, not cheap but not pricey. Clean.
38	1	0	0	0	It looked promising from the outside but once you get seated god forbid the wait staff actually does their job. She took my drink away and never came back with a refill she would show her face once every maybe MAYBE 10 minutes and wouldn't even come to your table.  ... The food was a different story. They have wonderful chips and salsa  ... But their entrees absolutely suck. The rice was undercooked the meat was extremely fatty  ... For 14 dollars for a burrito I expect more.
38	5	0	0	0	I don't get why this place has only 3.5 stars, the food is awesome, the ambiance is really nice and relaxed, and the prices are reasonable.  ...  ... The guacamole is so delicious with a sweet sauce on the side... I also had the fish tacos and the veggie burrito (I shared both don't judge me) and both were very delicious - fresh ingredients, not processed, yummy.  ...  ... And the patio area is really lovely. Thumbs up all around.
38	5	0	0	0	Love the carnita tacos and happy hour shrimp cocktail is amazing!!!
38	5	0	0	0	This was my first time coming here. I was just driving down the road and decided to check it out. There weren't that many people as it was right before everyone got off work. I was served very quickly and service was on top of everything. I tried the tamales and I have to say that it was awesome. But I may be a little biased since I love tamales already. Salsa was to die for. But again I am biased. Service was excellent and for excellent service I give a rating of 100%. That's how I rate the percentage of the tip the waiter got. For everyone that likes Mexican food go here and check it out.
38	1	0	1	0	I went once because I live real close, and wanted mexican food. Unfortunately, I will not be going back because it was not good. I got a burrito and it was doused in oil, it was just terrible. I did not even finish it, because it was causing an upset stomach. Maybe I just chose the wrong dish, but that dish caused me to not wanna go back.
38	4	0	0	0	Really great place with a decent amount of parking.  One of the best margaritas I've had  - and at happy hour prices!  Yummy chips with chunky salt and HUGE burritos!  Two thumbs up :)
38	1	0	0	0	Horrible food - carne asada tacos flavorless and what could count as flavor tasted like old shoes (Don't ask ;p ) ...  ... Guacamole was mush and served with I assume agave syrup very bad combination ...  ... Baseline for me is a basic beef dish if that isn't at least edible not a good sign for anything else
38	5	0	1	0	In my opinion this is one of the best Mexican food restaurants in town.  They have a really unique style to their plates and presentation.  The flavors are unique and traditional which is an oxymoron but if you have had as much Mexican food as I have you would get it.  I guess it's a unique twist on a traditional base of flavors.  Staff is attentive, easy going, cool group of hipsters. ...  ... Hands down 5 stars!
38	3	0	0	0	i liked it here! food and service were both good. ordered the guacamole for an app--it comes with an unexpected sweet sauce, but it's really, really good!  super addictive.  i got the enchiladas for my main course; it was ok. nothing mind blowing.  ... best part of the experience was their hibiscus margarita. best margarita i had in phoenix. :)
38	5	0	0	0	First time here and I have to admit I fell in love! Ended up coming here after our first choice for a valentines day dinner had over an hour wait. Best decision ever! Everything I ordered tasted amazing and my boyfriend enjoyed his food just as much. Service is very good and I love the casual atmosphere. I ended up ordering a frozen hibiscus marg, the carne asada tacos, and substituted the size for the posole. Delicious! The boyfriend had the red chile enchiladas with chicken and pork for the meat. He prefers the pork hands down.  ...  ... Would definitely recommend this place to everyone and I will be coming back soon!
38	4	0	0	0	Love this place a lil pricey though so I go during lunch or happy hr.  Super fresh ingredients!  Love the shrimp tacos juicy and flavorful.  Quest is great, fresh lime juice in margarita.  Chimi is huge.
38	1	0	1	0	Recently moved to Az and was born and raised in So. Cal. On a quest to find "real" Mexican food in my new state, and have sadly been disappointed yet again.  I will start with the cons..... Chips were a great portion and they even brought out 2 salsa bowls without us having to ask.  However, the chips had massive amounts of some sort of kosher salt. When we asked for different chips the waitress told us that's all they had but she gave us chips from the "top" and hopefully that would be better. It was not :( We ordered nachos $10 (no meat), fish tacos w/ soup $12, and a quesadilla $7.  What a disappointment when the food came.  The $7 quesadilla was tiny, I mean miniature. Where I come from a $7 quesadilla will get you an extra large tortilla grilled not microwaved with a side of rice and beans.  This place NO!!! Just the quesadilla on a small plate w/a tiny lil side salad.  The fish tacos tasted like they got them straight from that large body of water inTempe. No rice and beans just 2 tacos, and a tiny bowl of what appeared to be mole "soup" YUCK" all for a whopping $12!!!!!!  The nachos were mediocre tasteless black beans and minimal cheese. No meat and just tons of the same damn salty chips.   ... Pros - service was good,the waitress was kind and gracious when we told her the food sucked.  We left after 2 bites and the manager comped the entire meal.   ...  ... I can't imagine how this place has 4 stars but it appeared that everyone was happy and the place was packed.  My expectations are obviously A LOT higher then even I thought.   Try them if you dare...... Drink plenty of alcohol, their bar looked pretty cool. Maybe that will help wash down the mess they call "Mexican" food.
38	4	0	0	0	Went here with some coworkers on a business trip for lunch.  We picked it for the name.  The chips and salsa were good.  I got the quesadilla with chicken, it was good and was not too soggy.  The others in my party got tacos and said the guacamole sauce was a great compliment to the tacos.  The waitress seemed a little stressed, it was busy.  We got sufficient refills of chips, salsa, and beverage and it appeared other tables did too.
38	5	0	0	0	How does this place only have 3.5 stars?? Everything I've had here is incredible and the ambiance is great. Some of the best bartenders and wait staff I've ever experienced. I highly recommend the fish tacos and the guacamole.
38	3	0	0	0	Great happy hour deals, and as far as I can tell the daily/weekly specials look great. I only had a few appetizers and they were pretty okay. The guacamole order was enormous, but had a kind of odd sweet sauce garnish (some sort of reduced liquer with roasted jalepenos I think) that was just hard to get used to. The flautas were delish and margaritas (frozen) were of high standards.
38	3	0	0	1	The service is good which is important!  I ordered a Cesar salad and added chicken I was surprised that the amount of chicken on a skewer was so little I left hungry.  Other than that it was good but guys cut loose with a little more chicken.  :)
38	5	0	0	0	The food memory that I have of Mucho Gusto is like a dream made of sand that gets brushed away in a gentle wind that ends in a singular impression that is so beautiful that you can only see pieces of it at a time. It's like closing your eyes in broad daylight and watching beautiful colors burst on the back of your eyelids. The one brilliance that I can articulate is the guacamole. This is no ordinary guacamole. It is as distinctly unique and wonderful as a Lear jet is to a prop plane. How's that possible?... Grand Marnier jalapeo reduction sauce.
39	3	0	1	1	I really want to leave 4 stars for this place. It's new.. it seems family run.. the people working there were oh so nice. I was just disappointed in my sandwich.  ...  ... They use boar's heads meats and cheeses, but they don't carry any of the more "exotic" delish cheeses like havarti. Can't fault them for that. I had a turkey & cheese sandwich on a hero with garlic spread. Bread was blah. Out of a bag, boring, not tasty at all. Garlic spread was all mayo and no flavor (I'd prefer to see more of an aioli type spread, but that's me being picky). The only yummy thing about it was the turkey - which I can buy at Smith's for less. At $7.99/sandwich (with no sides!), I just expect a little more pizazz or taste. Next time I'll try an Italian sub and hopefully it will be more exciting.  ...  ... The fiance had some of the warm food - chicken cordon bleu with veggies and potatoes. He loved it. They also carry bfast and whatnot so I'm interested to try some of their other foods.
39	5	1	1	1	I had a sandwich from here. I was not sure what to order, but my friend suggested that i try the chicken with cheese. i was expecting something like sliced meat, but it twas a thick, juicy piece of chicken with cheese and and veggies. I really enjoyed it, and they also included a mini anti-pasta salad and bread pudding. I dont know if is how they normally do it, or if it was because i was with my friend, who is a regular. Either way, i was happy regardless.  ...  ... the prices may be high, but the sandwiches are very filling. i had half for lunch and the other half for dinner  ...  ... It breaks my heart that when i pass by, few cars are there. It is located in the small plaza just underneath Carmine's on the Hill. There isn't alot of businesses that are open at that plaza....bummer...  ...  ... I hope you give it a try!
39	1	0	0	0	Closed. Damn!
39	2	0	0	0	THIS RESTAURANT IS CLOSED! The Pasta Shop took over the location, which is a huge upgrade.
40	5	0	2	1	I got a chance to take a sneak peak into The Lady Silvia during a globe salon event.  All I can say is that we need more places like this in Las Vegas!  ...  ... It is located on the bottom floor of the Soho Lofts downtown.  There is an unmarked door that leads you thru a small dark hallway.  There is another door that leads you to the bar.  It is beautiful inside, with checkered floors that are flanked by tall bookshelves full of books.  It is dark inside, there is a DJ booth and graffiti on the ceiling.  It is unpretentious and tucked away- so refreshing to have in Las Vegas.  Once this opens up, I will be here frequently.
40	4	5	6	5	Had the pleasure of visiting Lady Silvia last weekend for a friend's going away party. When visiting a new spot (especially one out of town), I go in with 0 expectations. The first few weeks of any new bar/restaurant are always a bit wonky - everyone is still working out the kinks. ...  ... Love the aesthetic of this downtown lounge. Sexy library. With booze. There were TV's showing Magnum P.I. reruns too. Kinda random, but I love a good mustache any time. ...  ... As I mentioned before, it takes awhile for any new spot to get into a groove and the drinks here are no exception - was warned ahead of time not to order anything too crazy. Cranberry and vodka it is! Served up cold and strong, just the way I like it. Bartenders were friendly, too. ...  ... Looks like they'll be set up for video poker soon. Not sure if that's really necessary since it seems to be a perfectly lovely spot to hang out without gambling. But hey, I'm not a local, nor a betting woman.  ...  ... Would definitely come back when in town. Very cool, hip joint. Very Vegas. Me likey.
40	4	1	1	2	This spot makes me feel Im in a Stanley Kubrick movie . Its hidden entrance and lack of signage make you feel special when pull open the oversized wooden door. Go here after work start the night there then go back at the end of the night. Another great edition to the 18B
40	3	0	4	1	Once you step into this place you are amazed at the money and creativity they put into this place. I totally could live in Lady Silvia and make is a batchelor pad loft, just by moving a few pieces of furniture out to make room for my bed. This place is super rad inside. The bartenders are great and very much good at sitting and talking to you and remembering your name and shaking your hand when you come in. The things that give it only 3 stars are the PRICE OF DRINKS, the gaming in the top of the bar and the never ending "soft openings". I wish they would just have the dadgum grand opening already!! The drinks are twice the price of the drinks at Artifice 3 blocks away and the table top gaming is irritating because it's what I DON'T want to see in an artsy fartsy bar in the Arts District. They are just in the way of putting your drinks down and all the times I've been in there I've not once seen someone playing on them. I usually bring friends in here to show them how awesome it is in there, have one drink ( because of the high prices) and then head on down the road to Artifice or Dino's where my booze money can go 2 to 4 times the distance. I would give this place a SOLID 5 stars if they would do away with the gaming and lower the drink prices. Just saying my piece Mike and Sam, you guys have a great bar. Just needs those tweaks to make it what it needs to be and to get it totally packed.
40	4	3	5	5	Cool new spot in the sorta "mid-downtown" area. Think of it as like a poor man's "Library @ Marquee." I don't mean that in a bad way. It's definitely a great option if you're looking for a chill spot to have a drink. ...  ... Tonight, they were playing what my friend described as "minimal techno" music. It definitely set up a chill and unique vibe. I like the comfortable chairs. ...  ... They don't have a signature cocktail drink list set up yet, but the bartender told me they are working on one. For now, I ordered an Old Fashioned and it was pretty damn good. ...  ... I'll definitely keep this place in mind for a return visit.
40	5	0	0	0	What a delightful surprise!!  In visiting my son last weekend he invited me and a friend to dinner which we had at Chicago Joe's across the street. So, when he asked us if we would like an after dinner drink we thought what the heck, sure. The best thing was to be able to walk across the street and be totally surprised  at where we ended up. This new bar is AMAZING from the minute you enter the building, then walk into a library type setting that would make Harry Potter glad... I would recomment this fantastic bar to anyone looking for a great new experience~~  ...  ... Pat E. ... Lake Arrowhead, CA
40	5	0	3	0	A really great low-key place to hang out and have a drink! ...  ... First, although the street address is 900 S Las Vegas Blvd, the entrance is actually on Hoover Ave, closer to 4th Street.  The Las Vegas Blvd address is for the Soho Lofts building.  There's no visible sign from the street so look for suite 130-140 (one of those) above a door, which is the entrance to a lobby -- I imagine to the Soho Lofts.  Just head straight inside and you can't miss the bar.  Parking is available across the street on 4th and Hoover, but it's (sort of) unpaved/gravel-y so watch out with strappy heels!   ...  ... The inside is dim but has some really neat antique/gothic looking furniture, e.g., high back velvet chairs and tables with marble tops.  The walls are lined with bookshelves from floor to ceiling with books.  There's also some beautiful ornate chandeliers and light fixtures.   ...  ... The sitting area is pretty spacious with lots of chairs, chaise lounge chairs and sofas, and looks like it can accommodate various groups of people.  They had music playing from speakers, but it wasn't so loud that I had to shout to talk to the person next to me.  It also looks like they have a DJ booth.  ...  ... The bar area itself is smallish; from what I remember, there's no menus so be prepared to know what you want to order!  I tried to order a Dark and Stormy but unfortunately, they didn't have ginger beer.  Other than that, the bar seemed to be fully stocked.  If you sit in the sitting area after a certain time (9pm on Saturday), a waitress comes around.   ...    ... My group left about 10:15pm on a Saturday night and although it wasn't crowded by any means, it had started to pick up.  We then headed over to Insert Coins, and while that was fun, it would have been just as good (or better) to stay at The Lady Silvia.  It has a very cool and sophisticated ambiance, really similar to The Artisan.
40	4	1	1	1	Like: Downtown Cocktail Lounge ...  ... The Lady Silvia is a sweet little speakeasy located on the street level of ultrachic SOHO Lofts. It opened I think fall 2011, still few people know about it.  ...  ... Enter Lady Silvia from Hoover St, near Resnick's Grocery. We always find street parking, but it looks like you can park in a flat lot across Hoover St. Upon entering, you are met with a Please No Smoking sign.  ...  ... It seems to me the main customers of Silvia are the denizens of SOHO Lofts. Secondary audience, I think, is the artsy-fartsy crowd -- I heard about Silvia through my ubertrendy art cluster.  ...  ... I've been only a couple of times and both times, it was relatively slow. The bar entertained near it's max capacity of twelve, but the table seating (of maybe 40 tops) had only two parties of two. I don't know if it ever gets crazy busy, but the times I've been there, it's been a mellow place to hang out and just talk either with a date or a medium-size group of friends.  ...  ... The theme is kind of like The Library [bar] in NY. The longest walls are stuffed with old legal texts, encyclopedias, year books, etc, and a couple mounted flat screens. At the far end is the DJ booth, though the music isn't so loud you can't hear your party talk about the latest American Apparel ad campaign. Don't expect to find a dance crowd; this is a loungey lounge.  ...  ... The high ceilings are adorned with spray paint, looking like Basquiat did the honors after being forced to take Lithium for a year.  ...  ... The furnishings are very World Market Center. Gilded Rococo chairs with pops of sick neon green, acrylic chairs, curly elaborate fixtures, and the like. Unusual color combinations that seem to work.  ...  ... The drinks are not that expensive. I had a $6 gin and tonic with an average pour.
40	3	0	1	0	Looks awesome on the inside and is super cute but... My experience just wasn't very good. I came here with high hopes since a bunch of friends had raved and I really really wanted to love it as much as they all do. I brought a check-in special and headed to the bar. Someone asked if they could help me, when I showed them the offer they said they couldn't help me, I needed one of the female bartenders, and walked away. He came back later asking if I'd been helped. Um, no. Finally a bartender came out of her conversation with the other bartender to see if I wanted anything. She was friendly and prompt but the time I spent waiting for help was twice as long as the time it took for them to help me. We found seats and hung out for a bit to drink and then left. I'd give it another shot but if the next visit is much the same, I probably won't come back. The music was ok, decor was wonderful, we had an okay time.
40	3	0	1	0	Well I've definitely experienced better, but I'm going to give this place 3 stars because the interior was very pretty and the speakeasy theme was executed well. It was actually hard for us to find the place because we kept driving back and forth on Vegas Blvd and Hoover, but we didn't see a single sign anywhere, besides the one for the parking lot which was run by some guy that looked like an old bum. In fact, when we entered the dirt parking lot, my friend literally said, "Okay, I'm assuming that's just a bum," but then the guy asked us to roll down the window so he could tell us where to park. That actually gave us a good laugh though.  ...  ... Then we walked around the building on the corner of Hoover and Vegas Blvd, but still saw no sign, so we just went inside and asked the front desk guy where The Lady Silvia was. There is no sign at all, but when you open the door you hear the music and there's a guy that checks everyone's IDs as they walk in. Definitely "speakeasy style." The place is pretty small, so most of the nice seats were taken, but we went to the bar first to claim our free Stella with check-in. We had to wait about 5 minutes because the bartender girls kept only helping out the men (big tips I'm guessing) and the one guy behind the bar (I'm guessing he was a barback) would ask us what we needed, then immediately tell us he can't help us. We finally got our Stella in a regular pint glass. It looked like we were the only people that got Stella in a pint glass though. Everyone else got the nice Stella Artois glasses. It wasn't a big deal though, just a minor detail.  ...  ... We were probably here for about 15 minutes before deciding to leave because we just didn't get a very good vibe here. I might give this place another shot sometime in the future, but not anytime soon.
40	5	2	3	5	Even with GPS, this is still a place that even guys have to ask for directions to navigate to. But it is a nice lounge close to downtown to hang out at, away from the usual tourists hot spots and drunk cigerette smoking drink spillin' people . The only thing to really keep in mind is that no food is serve here, so eat before coming here or pick up something from the grocery store a few doors down or order some pizza and have it delivered. ...  ... And DO NOT rearrange the furniture! ...  ... Extra star for no smoking!
40	4	2	4	2	So cool you can't even find it. ...  ... I've been here a couple times. The second time, I couldn't remember where I was going... Luckily, my recollection of the location got a little better and I will continue to return for my usual crown & 7. ...  ... DECOR: This place screams speakeasy!! But I'm going to assume they have a liquor license and you don't need a secret password to get in. The Prohibition era concept was perfectly executed here. The walls are lined with antique'd books. And there are a bunch of cozy chairs and couches so you can take a seat and hang with friends. ...  ... MUSIC: Both times, they played house music. ...  ... EVENTS: I was first introduced to the Lady Sylvia at the MetroArts Ermelinda Manos fashion show. They opened up into the space/gallery next door. Runway and all. Generally well-dressed people, strong drinks, good company. ...  ... This place has a certain appeal you cant find anywhere else in Las Vegas. If you're looking for an off-beat date to have a drink or you're just bored of the rest of the town, check this place out! Oh, and if you're hungry. Feel free to order in. They don't have a problem with outside food since they don't serve any!
40	3	1	2	1	The atmosphere is great for a romantic couple or group no more than 5. Otherwise, Watch OUT. They reaalllllyyyy didn't like us moving the furniture so we a group of 15 or so could hang out and chat. It put a bit of a damper on my willingness to get lit. After all I wouldn't want to offend them. My thought was instead of having to put the furniture back immediately where we got it from (especially since we were the only ones in there) let us know to make sure we put it back before we leave, after all we are adults.  ...  ... The drinks were a bit on the expensive side, 15 a mixed drink which is: meh, okay, I had better; for the price I expected it to taste at least good to yum. So we limited our drinks, for that reason and I had work really early the next morning.  ...   ...  ... To improve, esp. if the place is empty:  ... -use a different technique. I would have been more relaxed, had more fun, ordered more overpriced drinks and tipped better.   ... -come out from behind the bar once in a while if no one else is there and see if there is anything else we want (you would have made alot more money in tips).
40	5	1	4	1	just moving into Soho and stumbled upon The Lady Silvia. ABSOLUTELY loved it! Incredibly nice people, welcomed us to the neighborhood. Loved the atmosphere! If you live in Vegas and know of the Griffin, it's kinda like Griffin meets a library with a Cheers neighborly feel. I just got the keys to my place today and I'm already in love with this as my new hang out spot. Best part, bring your dog to the bar!
40	2	6	9	5	This is a Hipster Bar that goes out of it's way to be a hipster bar.  ...  ... I get it you don't have a sign, you're too cool for a sign, but guess what, it's almost impossible to find you without a sign, it's even harder when you're in the lobby of a loft building. ...  ... The library feel of the place was nice and the staff was ok, but other than that I can honestly say I don't get why people like this place. It's and average bar, in a somewhat crappy location, that goes out of it's way to not be "found".  ...  ... And if a group of more than 5 want's to go in the place forget about it, there were 4 people (including 2 employees) in the place when our group arrived, when we tried to move a chair you would have thought we were knocking down a load bearing wall, it's chair, get over yourselves. So unless you want to sit sprawled across 3 living rooms worth of furniture that is not really arranged in any practical fashion while straining to hear what people on the other side of the group are saying, you're better off going somewhere more group friendly. ...  ... They always say To Each Is Own, but I guess to me it's not The Lady Silvia
40	2	0	0	0	I really was hoping to like this place. I live downtown so any new addition to my neighborhood is welcome. ...  ... The good: gorgeous bar. Nice looking crowd. Decent music. ...  ... The bad: Completely lackadaisical staff. It wasn't busy.  We sit at the bar. Over 10 minutes before a bartender even notices us because she's busy socializing. Second round of drinks? Didn't happen. We got bored waiting and left. ...  ... You go to bars that are twice as busy downtown like the Griffin or Artifice and those bartenders work it. I'm not seeing that here. ...  ... NOTE: here's no sign and it's next to Global Salon, if that helps.
40	5	1	2	2	I was really skeptical of this place at first, thinking it was going to be hipster vomit and mega-over priced drinks. But after spending some time there on their non-busy nights, I really enjoy the place. The bartenders are always super friendly and chatty. The drink menu is very unique and fun. $12-$14 for their signature cocktails, but they are worth it. The decor is bad ass. Very unique. I always feel like I am sitting in one of my rich friends' dad's basement. Except instead of stealing from his bar, I just pay for my drinks like an adult ;)
40	4	0	3	3	The Lady Silvia is a very mysterious lady indeed. You can walk on by and not even notice her. There are no signs or advertisements in the area to indicate she exists. It's a modern day speakeasy nestled near Resnicks when you look through the glass door it looks like an empty office space. Walk straight and push open the door that resembles a wall panel. ...  ... When you walk in it looks like a library with vintage accents. The ceiling is decorated with graffiti. The drinks run about $12.00 to $14.00 dollars each. I had a Cherry Collins it tasted decent. I've never had a drink sprinkled with pepper before ...it was different.  I like the atmosphere because the music isn't too loud and you can carry on a conversation over it. Whatever you do don't move the furniture around they are sensitive about that. The chairs are unique and look cool so I don't blame them. ...  ... It's a perfect place to have drinks with friends because it's in a intimate space. The location downtown is low key and the there is perfect parking across the street.
40	4	0	0	0	Went to The Lady Silvia when my guy and I were doing a "1920s" themed date night.  Thanks to fellow Yelp reviewers, we didn't have a hard time finding the place.  Found the dirt-ish lot, and saw two guys standing outside a door smoking.  Figured that was the place and so it was.  The bouncer was extremely nice, and I loved the decor when I entered. ...  ... The place was pretty packed when we got in at about 10pm on a Saturday.  We were able to snag one seat at the bar, and my guy stood next to me.  Drinks were fair priced - what you'd expect from this kind of little lounge.  The bartenders were very friendly and attentive,  ...  ... The screens behind the bar were playing old 1920s silent movies which I found awesome, and the furnishings and decorations were amazing.  It was like the Roaring 20s meets Anthropologie.   ...  ... My only downside was the house music the DJ was spinning was playing was so loud we were literally yelling at each other to talk.  Yes, it was great for keeping the mood up, but given this wasn't exactly the type of place you dance at, I expected something a little lower for conversation. ...  ... All in all, we'd definitely try it again.  The night we went there were two parties going on, which could account for some of the loud and busyness.   ...  ... If you're looking for a lounge that feels different than your average 20 something casino lounge or nightclub, it's worth going and checking it out.
40	3	2	5	3	You probably won't find this place the first time you look for it, because there's no sign and it's set back a bit into the building.  But just find Globe Salon and it's right next door.  Yeah, just go into that dark creepy hallway, you're almost there.... ...  ... I love the decor and the smoke-free environment here! and..... it's pretty close to my house? ...  ... Sorry, I run out of good things pretty quickly.  This place has a lot of potential, but has two major downfalls - super overpriced drinks and crazy slow service.  The drinks were pretty tasty, but for $12-14 at a small, off-strip location, I would like to be blown away with deliciousness.  (compare to $8-11 for as good or better drinks at DCR or Vanguard).  If money is no object, they have a very impressive selection of original and classic cocktails.   ...  ... The bathrooms are located outside the actual bar, in that dark hallway as you come in, just FYI. ...  ... I'll be happy to come back when I have plenty of time and someone is buying me drinks.  The couches are not only gorgeous, but super comfortable. It's a place you'd like to stay and have an intimate chat or good for a bigger group (just don't move the furniture!) ...  ... I think this place is still finding it's way a bit, so I'm optimistic for the future. After spending a hour in a smoky bar this past weekend leaving smelling like an ashtray, it really makes me appreciate places that are smoke-free.
40	4	0	0	0	So this is going to get a bump in stars for some special circumstances, and a knock in stars, too... so I think it balances nicely at 4*'s... ...  ... First: atmosphere. Incredible. I have a graduate degree in set design, and this place is legit. The library, the couches, the details - so different! Such a payoff for just FINDING the place (it makes you feel special just for getting there). It's next door to Globe Salon FYI :) ...  ... Second: vibe. It was Monday night and completely dead. So dead that it was just me, my buddy, and the bartender for a while. This was a bonus since the bartender was bored and made us specialty shots of their margarita (the pinch of cayenne is so great! i'm going to have to start doing that!). I think it'd be a great party spot, but for being empty it lacked energy. ...  ... Third: libations. I ordered The Expressionist. My buddy ordered The District. We ended up switching. The were solid drinks, but with a solid price tag. I think the Manhattan I had at Vanguard was better, at almost half the price, but both were very tasty creations. ...  ... Enjoy the adventure of it all! Love that downtown is getting so crafty!
40	4	0	1	0	The first rule of The Lady Sylvia is that you don't talk about The Lady Sylvia.  Then again, maybe you should, or how would they get any business?  What I'm alluding to is the fact that you would never be able to accidentally stumble onto this speakeasy unless you are specifically looking for it (then again that wouldn't be an accident).  There is no sign anywhere, it's in the middle of a street most people wouldn't intentionally drive through, and the parking lot across the street is just a dirt lot!  So really this a place that truly relies on word of mouth and social media marketing. ...  ... And good thing it has so much going for it in order to help that word of mouth.  I can't figure out the difference between hipster and trendy, but I'm sure this would be some sort of combination of the two.  Just imagine it as a library with some fancy-pants furniture and combine it with the secrecy, you'll feel like you're part of the Illuminati.  The walls are filled with books, and the TVs have films from the Criterion collection (for you people not in that know, that usually means old foreign films) playing.  The bartenders are attractive in a bohemian way and there's a DJ in the back when you come in later at night although then the music gets a little to loud to have a proper conversation.  There's also an art gallery connected that they take advantage of special events every now and then. ...  ... As for the drinks themselves, I do particularly enjoy the specialty drinks which range from $12-$14 such as The Lady Sylvia itself.  The only beer they have on draft is Stella Artois and if you just know when to come or what you need it just may be on the house.  As for the well drinks, that would probably be my one knock on this place as they're definitely watered down.  I plan to stick to the Stella Artois, Newcastle, and the specialty drinks in the future.  It would be nicer if it was closer to those bars on Fremont Street or by Charleston & Main for some hopping but then again, maybe this lady deserves your complete attention.
40	5	0	3	3	First, I need to say that if your grip is with not being able to find the place, then maybe you should not come here.  ...  ... This place is fantastic. I love the ambiance, the hidden location, the cocktails. There are so many things I love about The Lady Silvia. If I was to create a bar/cocktail lounge, this would certainly be a template. I love that it is one of a select few non smoking bars in the area. I really dig the feel of a mansion library and the antique, yet comfortable furniture. It's only a fireplace and a few ghouls away from becoming the Haunted Mansion at Disney Land.  ...  ... Again, yes it's hard to find. However, it is well worth every effort you may put forth. Their parking lot (to the north, just across the street) is dirt so keep that in mind. ...  ... The cocktail list is excellent, featuring signature, twisted and seasonal selections. Beer options are 6$, with a nice list of white and red wines. Bottle service is also available at 200$.  ...  ... I also feel that after reading other Yelp reviews, a word should be said about the service. On a reasonably busy Saturday night, we were greeted promptly, and exceptionally. The service may not be as fast as you are you used to at your normal watering hole, but these are craft cocktails, people. Relax, enjoy the atmosphere and wait a minute for your drink.  ...  ... Hours are S-T 3:00pm-2:00am, F-S 3:00pm - 3:00am. Let's keep this place around.
40	4	0	0	0	Quiet, cool place near downtown. The interior looks like a Victorian library and though it's clearly fake, it's well done. Cocktails were solidly good and a good deal better than anything on the strip.  It was hard to find as there is no sign out front and the entrance is on a side street.
40	2	0	0	0	We've been here before and even catered a few events here, but unfortunately this evenings performance was lack luster for both service and drink quality. Considering that these are two out of three of Lady Silvia's main "categories" means that it only leaves atmosphere left, which was also lacking tonight because of the association that was present for their group meeting. It took about 15 minutes to order 3 drinks after being ignored....we were sitting at the bar, which shouldn't be too difficult, one of us was also gambling. It was pretty apparent that the usual appearance of ownership was not here tonight and being in the food service business we understand how hard it is to hire staff to become an extension of yourself; from one owner to another we wish you better luck next time on your hiring expedition.
40	3	3	9	5	So after a while of circling the building a few times, a regular patron came to save us and show us the way in. The way the doors looked I thought it was a hallway into the building and not a suite. It is rather dark inside so it doesn't really tip you off to anything there. If you're a poor soul with bad direction - look for the Globe Salon. Now to the right of it are doors with a big 140 / 150 and there you go.  ...  ... Once you are in you find yourself a dark, romantic, swank little nook. The BF and I ordered The Expressionist and the Goldie. The Expressionist sounded good to us with a Irish Whiskey base, but it was a bit heavy on the orange bitters that overpowered anything else. The Goldie was pretty tasty though. I'm not normally a creamy cocktail type of gal, but lately that expresso creaminess sounds so nice.  ...  ... . $33 w/tip to have one drink each is steep. If it was exceptionally mixed and innovative then I wouldn't have problems with paying that, but the Expressionist only had a face of orange and not the wave of flavors we hoped.  ...  ... We were there within Happy Hour time, but we were charge regular price as well I realized....good thing I handed over a groupon I had. Still, if it's 15 minutes before the hour ends, it's still happy so that was a bit sucky.  ...  ... It's a nice place to have a drink with a date, but I don't see myself going here a lot since it's a ways from other things. Maybe for a Midnight Snack pop up restaurant event I will give this place another go.
40	2	2	2	1	The Good: ...  ... - location is cool, in the Soho lofts downtown, unmarked building, which reminds me of the cool lounges/underground bars in NYC. ...  ... -decor resembles an old library.  Kind of reminds me of  Disneyland's popular "dark rides,  old vintage furniture gives Las Vegans something different. ...  ... -bathrooms are clean which says a lot for a downtown spot. No nasty pee puddles or clogged up toilets.  ...  ... -music is good.  lounge house music and sometimes a good DJ spinning.   ...  ... The Bad: ...  ... -overall, wasn't that impressed.  Went with a group after a concert once.  We stayed for one drink and great convo, but I've had a better time at the Artifice. My next visit was with a date.  Anywhere he and I go is sexy with a capital "S" but this place just wasn't for us.  Again, stayed for one drink and we were out. ...  ... -seriously, where's the eye candy?  Not here.  Hey, even if I'm on a date, I like to see some cuties (men and women included). ...  ... - the drinks sucked and are just as pricey as the Strip.  If I wanted to pay $12 for a cocktail, I would have gone to the Cosmopolitan.   ...  ... -MEH, what the heck has everyone been ranting and raving about?  I don't get it.  ...  ... I may try this place one more time, but 3 strikes and you're out, My Lady!!
40	1	10	8	4	In town for a congress and not a fan of Vegas my friends stole me away from the strip for dinner, a happy hour drink and some jazz. We got to The Lady Silvia and it reminded me of a done up Mega-version of LA's Library Bar.  ...  ... The decor was fancy-cheeseball. Gaudy nuveau-riche furniture and chandeliers, trying so hard to look expensive but you can tell its cheap furniture and decor. Done up Vegas style.  ...  ... The jazz band was great, it made the uppity, snooty bar feel a lot less pretentious, more mellow and relaxed. ...  ... One star because the service was despicable. Two washed up ex-sorority sisters working the bar (a blonde and a brunette with fake boobs and melting cakey make-up two shades too dark) were being really snooty about the free drinks promotion and refused to give me and my girl friend the free drinks that were being given out FREE to EVERYONE as a promotion. WTF!!! The funny thing is, that as a social experiment, we sent my friend's boyfriend to ask for the drink and they just gave it to him no problem and no questions asked. Really? ...  ... Thank God for Yelp! And for cathartic ONE star reviews post shitty experiences! ...  ... Suck it ladies!- (and I call them ladies cause I don't want to use the "B" word, though I was tempted, with the immature treatment and terrible customer service received, after I had bought three drinks AND tipped)! Wish I could have gotten my tip back! ... Oh well, at least I can leave this tip on Yelp for future Vegas visitors looking for a possible bar. Avoid this one. It thinks itself high and mighty and it's really just sad how hard it tries!
40	3	0	2	1	The bar itself is visually pleasing. The old bookcase theme is clever. The random chairs and black/white floor sets off a hipster vibe like no other. The bar serves food and boasts a "No Smoking" policy, which I am totally down with. ...  ... Drinks though, as others have noted, are pricey. These are prices I would expect to pay on the strip, not in some random lofts next to a beauty salon downtown. Downtown is known for having these great bars with great drinks prices - so that is where Lady Sylvia is lacking.  ...  ... While there during happy hour ($6 wines/$3 beers/lower well drink prices) my friends and I partook of their wine. I happened to have the Rock N Roll Wine which they are offering at $3 a glass during the month of August. My friends had wine as well. I decided, what the hell, I'll try one of the cocktails (the $12 ones, NOT the $14 ones, are you freaking kidding me? I can get better mixed drinks than these at Comme Ca during their happy hour for LESS!). I had the 18b, a very nice concoction featuring blueberry vodka. I will admit, Kenny, the bartender, knows how to mix it up well.  ...  ... The food - while we were there they were serving up tapas (called something else with a "p", but basically - tapas). They basically placed them all on a side of the bar and it was buffet style. Go up, get what you want and then tell the bartender what you had. Honesty policy pretty much. I had two tapas - don't remember their names, but they were pretty good. But they were all served on slices of thick, toasted bread. I like that they serve food - I just don't like the way they do it. None of the tapas were noted as to what they actually were. I picked up something I thought was seafood, but when I bit into it, it was definitely potatoes. The food is yes, a great idea, I think they just need to work on how they DO IT.  ...  ... Last but not least a few minor flaws - the gaming machines on the bar - why? While I was there not one person was gaming, not one. Young, hipster Las Vegans do not go Downtown to gamble. Lose the machines and the bar would be much better. And lastly - while my friends and I were there a couple came in the bar and brought in two dogs. The woman actually sat at the bar and held the dog in her lap. I mean, it was a serious WTF moment for me. Who brings dogs into a bar? What kind of bar (especially one that serves food) allows people to bring in their dogs? And no, these dogs were not seeing-eye dogs. THAT is one of the reasons I dropped this place a whole star. Without the dog fiasco it probably would have been 4. ...  ... So - visually pleasing, decent drinks (yet, again, pricey) a good bartender - in all honesty, had a decent time. Would I go back? Probably during happy hour. Would I be back on say, a Saturday night? Nah. I'll go to Vanguard and Downtown Cocktail Lounge for that.
40	3	1	1	1	I really, really want to LOVE this place. It has a hidden location, cool furniture arranged perfectly for chatting and snacking, books everywhere, and just a cool, library decor. But it's...confused. The bar itself was beautiful and kind of glamorous, as was the lighting. It had a classy feel to it, but then they had sports on the TVs? WHY? First of all, you don't need a TV! And if you do, play old movies or something a little unusual. But this is NOT a sports bar. Then the ceiling, which could have been elegant, had graffiti on it. Huh. I like graffiti, it just didn't fit. And the music was kind of hip-hoppish.  ...  ... I like this place, I just wish they'd pick a theme and go with it. ...  ... Aside from all that, the drinks were wonderful. There were many unique drinks to choose from, and all four of us in our party were happy with their selections. People who are complaining about the prices...get over it. You're in a cocktail bar in Vegas...expect to pay at least $12 for a drink. You can always stay home with your Coors Light, you know. ...  ... I think I'll come back when they are playing Jazz...it seems like that would create more of a whole package!
40	4	0	0	0	Went in the first time yesterday....Had a really nice time.  I did read some negative reviews but have the say people really nice and Kenny the bartender was great! ...  ... I am sure that we will be back!
40	4	0	1	0	Last night we came to The Lady Silvia after pregaming at my friends loft in Soho.   ...  ... There's a bouncer at the front entrance carding you.  When you walk through the hallway into the actual bar, you are transformed to an English-Prague type establishment.  The black and white checkerboard floor puts a nice touch to the ambiance.  The lighting is dim and intimate and the overall feel is super chill.  The staff was nice and there was a lot of space.   Definitely a lounge worth revisiting :-)
40	3	0	0	0	Went on a Friday night with a DJ. Fun music, neat decor. They were playing some French new-wave film alongside an older version of hamlet; worked really well with the library decor and close seating.  ...  ... Cocktails pricey for the location, but solid - their mint julep is much less sweet than I'd expect, nice and subtle.  ...  ... Definitely worth another visit, esp. on Friday evenings for live jazz and happy hour.
40	5	0	1	2	Hidden away in the Soho Lofts building in downtown Vegas, is one of the top lounge bars in Vegas.   ...  ... The space is brilliantly arranged--intimately lit and decorated with comfy, stylish couches.  It's also set up like a private library with shelves of books climbing to the ceiling.  The ceiling is covered in what looks like subway tunnel graffiti.  Flat-screen televisions behind the bar usually show sports and flat-screen televisions in the book shelves show black and white movies (often a classic version of Hamlet).  It's a mosaic of punk and Victorian decoration styles and I'm a big fan. ...  ... Like most lounge bars today, the drink menu is based on mixologist creations.  Lots of clever, tasty mixed drinks.  People I've brought there rave about the mixed drinks.  I'm more of a straight bourbon and beer fella, so I'll speak to that.  There's a decent whiskey selection (not outstanding, but plenty of tasty options) and Stella is on tap.  They do a nice pour on the whiskey.  The seating is comfy.  And the folks you'll meet at the bar are interesting.  That's a nice hang out spot.
40	5	0	1	1	Love this place... Great house cocktails and atmosphere.  They can do all the classics also, but their specialty drinks are fantastic.  The keg-erator of Stella Artois and proper matching glasses can't be ignored also. ...  ... I love the interior design of The Lady Silvia, it's like a dark library but very lively.   ...  ... Definitely worth your effort to find this place.  It's unmarked from the outside, which is very cool.
40	4	5	12	9	I've been to The Lady Silvia three times now.  I want to like it more and give out 5 stars, but 4 sits just perfect with my conscious. ...  ... The Lady Silvia probably has the coolest interior of any Vegas bar.  In fact they take it as far as they can without pushing over-the-top for trying way too hard. ...  ... The Lady Silvia is certainly not a hipster bar as some have suggested.  They do things too well here for the hipster to love on it.  The clientele is not comprised of hipsters.  The drinks & the prices do not speak  to the hipster.  Having said my peace  there I can now continue to review... ...  ... The drinks are one of the areas that prevent The Lady Silvia from attaining 5 stars.  There are several solid classic cocktails, as well as a few original creations that are enjoyable.  The drinks just fall a little short...lacking balance and proper execution generally speaking.  The prices have dropped from when I first came in though--the house crafted drinks going for $10 or $11 as opposed to $15.   ...  ... The bartenders also earn the 4 star mark...better than the average bar tender, but not the exceptional mixologist that I would expect upon entering into The Lady Silvia. ...  ... The Lady Silvia also has a wide array of events and weekly alterations to their normal business flow.  This is not good or bad in and of itself.  I am not into their attempt to be a sports bar during football nights, but others appreciate it I'm sure. ...  ... They also offer some CLASSIC Spanish style tapas for a couple of bucks.  They make for some nice snacks while you drink. ...  ... For me the hero is the ambiance and atmosphere.  And I will return again for that.  The Lady Silvia is a perfect place to come with a group of 4 - 6 friends who want to relax, enjoy some conversation on some uber cool couches, and have some good drinks....the pictures do not begin to do justice to the decor inside. ...  ... The Lady Silvia also lacks any sign.  I like this.  You have to find it to enjoy it though.  Enter on Hoover between the Globe Salon and the Gallery of Contemporary Art.
40	4	1	5	3	The Lady Silvia  offers craft cocktails in a neat speakeasy-like environment.  No external signage or obvious entry markings make it a cool experience to find during your first visit, while the assorted furniture and no smoking make for a relaxing spot to enjoy drinks and conversation. ...  ... It seems like many past reviews commented on the high price of drinks.  During my visit last night, the cocktail menu had signature, seasonal, and craft cocktail sections.  I forget which is which, but pricing for each section was $10, $11 or $12.  And there is happy hour!  It goes from opening till 8:00pm, and cocktails are only $6! ...  ... I only had a Manhattan and one of their seasonal cocktails, a gin based drink with apricot flavoring and some other fixings that I don't remember.  Both were well made, and has me looking forward to trying out more of the menu.  Good drinks and a cool atmosphere make this a cocktail lounge you need to check out.
40	4	0	0	0	Lady Silvia's is just the kind of place I was looking for - classy, low key, unique & serving up good craft cocktails. The entrance was unmarked but not hard to find.  Parking was a cinch.  ... Now for the cocktails... Okay, I'll come out with it -- I am a ginger beer fiend! So when I saw that the Lady had house made ginger beer incorporated into some of the cocktails I was eager to imbibe. The Moscow Mule was quite superior and I followed it up with an equally fine Dark & Stormy (not on menu).  I could have stayed there for hours and hours sipping the spicy, lightly sweet effervescent ginger beer drinks.  My hubby had a pretty good caipirinha with Leblon cachaa. Prices for cocktails were a reasonable $10-$11 which is less than I expected.  ... The signature cocktails were creative but on this night none of them sounded better than the ginger beer.  I would have liked to see a greater variety of signature cocktails with more rum or bourbon based choices.  For this reason I give the Lady 4 stars.  ... Overall Lady Silvia's is a great, unique place that I will visit again - like tomorrow night!
40	5	0	0	1	Went there for my birthday and was completely blown away. The bartenders and DJ were perfect. Attentive, quick and friendly. The requests made before getting there (a reserved space, tables and seats) were all set up beforehand. Bottle service was set up quickly with plenty of mixers. I can't wait to go back. I absolutely love this place.
40	3	0	3	1	The varied styles of antique-y looking furniture and bookshelves (with both real and fake books) high up the walls give this place a cool feel, and the fact that they don't have a sign outside the door gives it a kind of "exclusive" air that a lot of people apparently dig (I really couldn't care less). It attracts some of the types of people I try to stay away from (perhaps you've seen me mention wannabe hipsters in other reviews, especially about downtown places?), but most of the time I can overlook that. I might come back more often if the service were better and the drinks were cheaper. I had been handed a free drink coupon by one of their staff during some event I was at, and when I returned a few months later and gave it to my friend to use, the bartender not only refused to honor it, but also confiscated it from him and threw it away. WTF? There was no manager around at the time for us to consult with. That whole experience was a huge turn-off. Other times, a few of the different bartenders just haven't been that friendly, and they also didn't pour their drinks very well. (To be fair, some of them are very friendly and/or can also pour well; I just wish that extended to the entire bar staff). Normally, I just stick to going to Lady Silvia only on nights when Rock & Roll Wine does their free tastings there, or to stop in for a quick happy hour drink pre-First Friday activities.
40	4	1	2	2	This is an interesting little bar in the bottom of Soho lofts. Finding it is a little challenging; I'll save you some time and tell you the entrance is next to Globe Salon.  Once inside you'll find an interesting decor that has a decidedly artsy feel to it.  ...  ... They have a menu of specialty cocktails and we all tried something different. None of us got what we were expecting from the menu; some of us were happier, some of us went back to the bar to order something simpler. If you are feeling adventurous, I'd say that their cocktail menu is for  you, but I'd describe the things we tried as a "reimagining" rather than a "twist" on traditional drinks.  ...  ...  We really liked the variety of different seating arrangements; whether you want a seat at the bar or a table for groups, there are options. The couches are clearly the choice seats, but there didn't seem to be a bad seat in the house.  ...  ...  As mentioned in other reviews, there is no smoking in the bar. Given how cloudy Las Vegas bars can be, this (if nothing else) is a great reason to go to Lady Sylvia.
40	2	1	3	0	Very disappointing... And here is why... ...  ... 1) $16 cab ride from Encore, which is already on the north end of the strip ... 2) neighborhood itself is very seedy and impossible to get a cab AFTERWARDS. Ended up going to a gas station and a local pizza delivery guy gave us a ride. (Note: order from Prima Pizza!!) ... 3) bartenders and cocktail waitresses were both yawning multiple times! It was only midnight. Not a great tone to set for patrons.  ... 4) I asked for a Moscow Mule and they were 'out of' ginger beer. What kind of speakeasy doesn't have ginger beer.  ... 5) I settled for their 'House Speciality' drink the 'Expressionist', which was okay, but the bartender didn't even know the ingredients so she had a reference her cheat sheet. Lame.  ... 6) I asked for a Kir Royal for my wife. A very basic and simple drink but bartender said she didn't know what it was and made no effort to ask.  ... 7) $14 per drink for all of the above is a joke.  ...  ... Ended up costing $16+$31+7 (tip for pizza guy)= $53 for two mediocre cocktails.  ...  ... Won't be back.
40	3	0	0	0	We were trying to find parking for First Friday and found this lot across the street that the owner of Lady Sylvia was guarding. He told he'd let us park there for free (and not be towed) if we visited his bar, The Lady Silvia, for a couple of drinks. We figured, why the hell not? ...  ... There's no sign outside to indicate that there's a bar here at all, making it low-key, old-style hipster, and almost "exclusive." We had a pleasant surprise after walking through the doors. There's a short hallway leading to the bar. To the left of the hallway, there's the bathrooms (and they're clean too!) and to the right, there's an large-room art gallery. Definitely got us in the mood for First Friday! Kind of lends to the character of the place.  ...  ... Inside this lady, my date and I felt certainly under-dressed. Everyone was done up with club dresses and suits. Low lighting and a loud band, this place was lively with a hint of intimacy. There's a small bar and then there's a large lounge area with fancy plush chairs and tables. The walls are adorned with shelves full of books and some TVs playing an old black-and-white movie that nobody can hear. It all lends to the atmosphere of this place. Initially, I thought this place was swanky and cool. It certainly is. It's a hidden gem that I can imagine only a few people would know about. On the other hand, it's a bit gimmicky. I do like that it's nonsmoking though. ...  ... The drinks were definitely pricey! Rivaling strip prices even. Luckily, we were there during their Happy Hour (7 days/week, 5p-8p & Reverse Happy Hours: Tues-Wed-Thurs 11p-1a according to their site). $3 beers and reduced well drinks. I got a Moscow Mule and it tasted delicious for the first few sips and then I got an overpoweringly weird slam of ginger. Just ginger. Needed to mix it more. Their appletini was delicious. Their Cherry Collins was nicely crafted. Felt fancy. ...  ... A caveat though: my date and I were definitely the youngest people there. Everyone there was late twenties and up. Nothing wrong with that...just not really our scene yet. Would have been been nice to have a good mixture of ages instead. Kind of awkward. We got quite a few stares from people around us. I came here again with a group of girlfriends for their PUSH Thursdays event and needless to say, we were still the youngest there. You might not be bothered by that and still have a great time!    ...  ... The gambling machines at the bar made no sense. Kind of a WTF were they thinking putting this in. I mean, you've got the perfect original, speakeasy atmosphere going on and the well-dressed crowd, and you're going to have awkward thing at my seat at the bar? Hell, you could go to some Vons or a CVS to gamble. And it's much closer to home. Save that for the strip. ...  ... This is definitely a fun place for friends to come hang out at, maybe not to meet people though. People mainly kept to themselves like a clique out of the few times I went. Owner and service is awesome. Liked the fact that the restroom is clean too. It's a great, fun bar downtown with a nice concept. Worth a visit if you're in the area.
40	3	0	1	0	Getting in the front door was a cinch as someone in our group had been here before...although I wasn't paying attention at all so next time might be a little more difficult. ...  ... I'm not into sacrificing my retirement for a for a drink so I stuck to beer.  Prohibition ended 80 years ago.  I don't understand the whole speakeasy crazy drink prices thing.  Stella is the only thing on tap, which is fine by me.  They also pour it in Stella's  famous chalice glass which makes me feel all swanky inside.  I fully expected this to be $9 or $10 but it came in at $6.  I think $6 is my don't Whine-About-The-Price-Of-A-Beer thresh hold so that was nice.  The bartender said they'd have a few more things on tap coming soon. ...  ... We showed up around 9 on a First Friday and it was relatively quiet.  By the time we left is was pretty packed.  Out group gathered around a small table and seated ourselves on an eclectic assembly of little stools etc.   The decor described in other reviews is pretty interesting and felt sort of European.  I repeatedly found myself wanting to read the books but I guess that would have been a little anti social...maybe next time I'll come by myself and nerd out, ...  ... Overall this is a nice place to start off the night, I'll be back.
40	3	0	3	0	I don't understand this place.  It's not a bad place, don't get me wrong.  It's just impossible to find.  Met some business partners here and it took me forever to find.  There's no sign outside and it's located in a place you wouldn't generally think a bar would be.   ...  ... The set up inside is interesting as well.  Small little bar with a couple of flat screen TVs, the walls are decorated like a quaint little library with some chairs in the middle.  Price range is reasonable, this place has a feel like a members only bar and outsiders are not welcome.
40	2	8	11	4	Yea you see it, two stars. We arrived around 6, it wasn't too busy, plenty of seats at the bar and around the lounge. The three of us went up to the bar to grab a drink, and the male bartender, probably pushing 50, wearing a Afflication shirt two sizes too small and attempting to pull off a faux hawk, asks us what we would like. I ask if they have a specialty cocktail menu, he says no, not in a joking manner but kinda rough and rude. I could have sworn I read in reviews they had specialty cocktails, but ok, so then I ask what kind of Pinot Noir they have, he responds back to me, "Oh you must be the difficult friend" Excuse me? Yes I am picky when it comes to wine and specialty cocktails and that's the reason I ask BEFORE ordering a drink. I should have walked out then and there but my two friends wanted to stay and check out the lounge area. So after we sat there for a little bit, I didn't even finish my wine (I was given O.P.P, others people Pinot) we decided to leave. After leaving Bar & Bistro and having a wonderful experience over there with the bartender and the cocktails, I wouldn't give this guy another dime.
40	2	0	0	0	The place is a little difficult to spot from the address. It is located next to Globe Salon at the base of the SoHo Lofts in the Arts District. There is short term street parking and a lot across from the place.  ...  ... I was stoked to find another cool cocktail bar that came highly recommended by fellow cocktail enthusiasts .The doorman looked a little bored but I don't blame him it was 9:30pm on a Saturday night and the place was empty. I would have to most likely place the blame on Easter Weekend. We've never been ones to shy away from an empty space because sometimes that's when we've had our best experiences. ...  ... Not in this case. Bad start. The bartender SHOOK an Old Fashioned. Sorry but that's just a big fat NO NO. Bitter water is basically what he served. We also ordered a cocktail with Chartreuse in it. It was nice. Well anything with Chartreuse is fine with me!!  ...  ... The space had the makings of a fine speakeasy. But it just felt half done or just not cared for. I just don't understand Vegas with their cocktails and the use of crappy ice. I don't order a cocktail for the water content .There is a beautiful red cabinet by the bar and its practically empty with the exception of 4 wine bottles. What a waste of space with classic furnishings!  ...  ... I can see the venue as being good for group outings with the comfortable barcaloungers and library decor. Doesn't seem like there was food served as a couple of patrons brought in some pizza. It feels like a gentlemen's cigar lounge minus the 70 year old men smoking the cigars.  But I recommend you stick to beer for now. If this establishment wants to stand out for anything more, they'll need to better train their bartender at least on the classics! I expect that from a chain restaurant  or a "divey" irish bar (although I've met many an irish bartender who knows their stuff) especially if you're going to charge "cocktail bar" prices.  ...  ... This is yet another place I really wanted to like but just felt it was open for the sake of being open. The place was lacking soul. ...  ... Unfortunately, in my opinion. Lady Silvia will need to go back to finishing school.
40	5	0	0	0	The Lady Silva is a best combination of your neighborhood bar and and an upscale lounge. The staff is fun and friendly and the drinks are amazing.  I have been to TLS for events, parties, and to simply hangout with my girls. Each time I have had a unique experience.
40	5	0	0	0	Love this quaint little place, out of the way of all the partier's and clubbers and 21 years old that can't hold their liquor and barf on bars. :)  I have been there a handful of times and never been disappointed by the staff or the drinks.
40	4	0	3	1	Holy Crap! Came here for my first Yelp event and i was impressed! First off, had i known of about this place several months back when I worked in the downtown area; liquid lunches for sure! haha!  ...  ... Cute little lounge inside condos (I believe its a condo high-rise?) corner of Hoover and 3rd street. Not easy to find but once you finally make your destination, it will all be worth it. This place is like sitting in a college library having drinks. Secluded from the everyday Vegas life, probably no chance of running into anyone you know, because not many know about this place. Great atmosphere, good crowd-can't wait to go back.
40	4	0	1	1	Kinda spooky and creepy in here!  This place is a little odd!  When you finally see the suite no. and you open the door, it's like your going into a haunted house, and you want to turn around and leave!  The walls in the hall way are painted black, but it's kind of old looking!  Then when you open the doors to Lady Silvia, it's also dark, walls are black, the bar stands out!  (Don't even go there)  They have there walls covered in a built in book shelves!  And books just kinda tossed about in there, not in any kind of order or neat!  Some are laying down.  And the seating!  They have chairs, and like couches, all over the place.  Like vintage couches, that seat 2 maybe 3 people!  It's a very interesting place!  The bartenders are very friendly!  They also have happy hour!  And they serve a couple of beers on tap!  I like it, I will be back if I'm in the area.  ... Ohhhh, the bathrooms are cool!  Black toilets, and a black sink!  they have the mirror on another wall so your not hogging up the sink area!
40	5	0	0	0	Love my local bar!
40	3	0	0	0	It was pretty slow on the night we went in with a couple friends, with no band and lots of seats available. Apparently the bartenders could tell that we weren't locals or regulars 'cuz it literally took forever to get service to order some drinks. The atmosphere is very laid back and I like the decor, but they need to work on welcoming new folks.
40	4	0	0	0	This place is pretty nice to drink at. The atmosphere is nice, you can actually talk with your friends since the music is kept at a reasonable volume, and the drinks are reasonably priced (ordered a martini and an old fashioned and paid $17 before tip.
40	5	0	1	1	LOVE THIS PLACE! And people...it's a SPEAKEASY, it's supposed to be difficult to find. That's the whole point. When I was in Chicago a while back we went to find a speakeasy and it probably took us 45 minutes, we passed it twice. It's part of the experience and culture. There's not supposed to be a neon sign out front.  ... Sorry for the rant. The whole atmosphere is eccentric, classic and welcoming all at the same time. They have amazing drinks and the furniture is so eclectic. We venture down to TLS after work some days and it's a nice place to unwind. There is a cool pop-up art gallery next to it that has some really interesting pieces. TLS also has a lot of live entertainment and events. You can find them on their facebook page. All in all, I love this place. Everything about it is perfect.
40	2	0	0	0	I had heard good things about this place and was really excited to check it out. Unfortunately, I was rather unimpressed when I did. ...  ... For starters, I think the first rule of Fight Club should apply to speakeasy identity: if you're a speakeasy you don't advertise yourself as a speakeasy. Regardless, I think the second rule of being a speakeasy is that you should make good cocktails. My group ordered a variety of drinks off their cocktail menu and they were all sickeningly sweet. Not that there can't be a sweet drink or two on the list, but the saccharine shouldn't be uniform. ...  ... The space has a ton of potential but, as of my visit (which was admittedly some months ago), the decor/ambiance was in a bit of a speakeasy identity crisis. It's a beautiful building and room, but I found the hippy art, the TVs with sports, and the acoustic  singer-songwriter performing to be a bit incongruous. Seriously, who books an acoustic singer-songwriter to play a speakeasy? And somehow the acoustic singer-songwriter was so loud that it was difficult to chat over a cocktail. Also, the waitress botched my drink order. These things happen and I wouldn't ordinarily complain about getting served the wrong drink, but I'm convinced that she was unable to do her job because she couldn't hear customers over the damn acoustic singer-songwriter. ...  ... After we left this place we had a much better all-around experience at The Downtown.
40	5	0	3	1	This is among the coolest and most unique bars I've visited in Las Vegas. Located in the trendy downtown district, this bar has no signage. While some people might find this annoying, I enjoyed having to seek out this speakeasy. ...  ... The inside is beautiful, with plenty of bar seating and a lounge area that looks like a library. Televisions display black and white films on mute while music plays, creating a different type of audio/visual experience. ...  ... The drinks were reasonably priced and the bartenders were knowledgeable and poured with a heavy hand. After a couple delicious drinks, I felt good and still had money left over in my wallet. What more could you want from a bar? ...  ... Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed my time at the Lady Silvia and will definitely be back for more adult beverages. If you are in Las Vegas and haven't been here before, I highly suggest checking out this watering hole. You won't be disappointed.
40	5	0	0	1	Love the decor and atmosphere. had ladies night here and enjoyed being able to hear each other talk. Nice staff, good drinks, and good prices.
40	5	0	0	0	Super chill and cool victorian style ambiance and the drinks are pretty damn tasty!!! I love this place! If you can find it you will love it! It is on the Soho lofts next to Globe Salon
40	4	1	5	2	This place is just plain cool. The vintage speakeasy ambiance is really fun and different. I love the ornate chandeliers, the funky chairs, and the old movies playing in the background. It's a refreshing change of pace from the usual club scene. And I love that the music is soft enough that you can still hold a conversation.  ...  ... The drinks are good and not unreasonably priced.  ...  ... It can be a bit hard to find, but I suppose that's part of the charm. Anyway, I commend them for having lots of free parking (which is rare downtown).
40	5	5	8	10	This place is cool. Sure, they try REALLY hard to be cool (Willow on loop? Come on), but at the end of the day their hard work pays off. To find the place, simply look for the 140 150 above the doors to the right of the salon. I'm a bit older now, so I look for a bar with some atmosphere and the ability to have a convo. If I want to go to a club, I will. I don't need a DJ playing garbage on volume 12 while I try to end the week with a cocktail. That rant aside, the place is decorated with bookshelves lining the walls (I didn't check to see of the books were real) and comfy victorian looking furniture strewn about. The drinks will run you $10+, but they are larger than your average cocktail lounge drink (compare it to Velveteen & DCL) and will get you nice and toasty. All it takes is a minute of silence from your convo, a sip of your drink and a glance around the room before you find yourself saying 'I like this place'.
40	2	0	3	0	Ugh I want to like this place soooo bad but my goodness, it's failed me TWICE now! But last night it had three strikes and we were OUT!  ...  ... Last time I tried the place out, maybe a couple month ago.... I took my boyfriend there because we're both fans of speakeasyish bars. We went to The Roger Room in LA and were amazed so according to the reviews on Yelp, The Lady Silvia had potential! We loved that it's a hidden gem and the ambience is on point-- parlor furniture, bookshelves filled with all kinds of vintage and torn books, old movies playing, graffiti art on the ceiling, overall very tasteful decor! ...  ... First experience: It was a random Wednesday night, I had just gotten off work so it was like 1030ish. It wasn't busy at all.... I can't cut them any slack there haha. I'm in the service industry so I'm all about EXPERIENCE. Shortly after we sat down, cocktail waitress greeted us and just simply asked what we'd like. Not even a "hello, how are you, have you been here before" just a "do you know what you're having?" Ummmm no, we just sat down and haven't even looked at your menu... Sorry we're taking in the ambience? We were impressed until that very moment. Ruined it all. So we looked at the menu and made our decisions.... Maybe 15 minutes passed and she never came back. She was just gazing at her phone at the POS computer. We just got up and left, didn't even try a cocktail =\ and as we got up, she didn't even turn her pretty little head to notice or wish us a good night. FAIL! We went to the Velveteen Rabbit instead and were quite pleased.  ...  ... Last night: Brought a girlfriend who had wanted to check it out for a while now and a girlfriend visiting from AZ... I put the past experience behind me and decided to give them another shot because I really want to like the spot! Plus, I knew they'd appreciate the trendy speakeasy idea of the bar. We sat down in the lounge, browsed at the menu,  made up our minds on drinks and just waited to be served haha. Shocker. A gentlemen noticed we hadn't been helped and sent a waitress over-- wish HE could've taken care of us! She came over and just starred at us.... "Hi, sorry about the wait, what can I get started for you" is that so hard to spit out? It's beyond me. So we ordered. She brought back my friends' drink but she let me know they were out of the earl grey tea to make myyy drink. Okay, strike II.... But shouldn't you know what you're 86'd so when a guest orders that you can let them know right then and there so you can suggest something else? Ugh it was just another setback to add to their list!! And finally, she of course never came back to check on us. Another round? Waters? Ladies alright? Nada. I had to ask the same guy who first noticed us for the check. Strike III and we're out. She obviously didn't want a tip, so I just left 10%.... Which was more than she deserved! I hate tipping 10% because I hate receiving 10%!!!!!! But I also cannot stand servers who think they should receive at least 20% when they don't even work for it. My receipt says my server's name: Jaime.... I wouldn't know because she didn't introduce herself.  ...  ... We went to Velveteen Rabbit after this horrible Lady Silvia experience.... Again. Maybe they should hire PERSONABLE people who care to make their guests' experience! It's not my fault you may not like your job or working period, but don't ruin it for other people though. It really isn't that hard.  ...  ... I can't say I'd recommend this place. If anything, I'd tell people NOT to bother. I hope they get their shit together soon because it has potential, just needs LOTS of attention on details that go a long way.  ...  ... 1 star for the secret spot, nailed the speakeasy part. 2 stars for the ambience. I think I gave those generously too =[
40	5	0	0	0	Amazing happy hour and kiera the general manager was a great host.  Decor was very cool with a NY - San Fran speak easy vibe.
40	5	0	0	1	This place has never disappointed me and has always impressed visitors. Great drinks, an awesome happy hour, superb decor and awesome music soundbites.
40	5	0	1	1	Lady S is a great place to hang out and drink some stellar cocktails. The venue and overall decor manages to be modern, understated, and down to earth all at the same time. Hands down, Tina is the most fabulous and interactive bartender. It's definitely a must-see!
40	1	0	0	0	no outdoor seating as said on the website, management are rude to customers. overpriced drinks. wannabe mixologists. they obviously have no bar experience. only cool person there is kenny the bartender and the local high rise folks. The staff hates life.
40	4	0	1	1	So this review is WAY overdue. I've been coming to the Lady Silvia since day one. I really like it, the drinks are good, and the dcor is fabulous. It's decorated like a library, with a mix of vintage and contemporary seating. A friend says it reminds him of The Bazaar in L.A. ... The cocktails are pretty good, and thankfully they have lowered the price from what they were originally. Their happy hour is fantastic, I believe like 3-6 dollars for beers, wine and cocktails. On some nights they have li music, which is nice. The service can be hit or miss. Sometimes they are super attentive and other times not so much.  ...  ... This is usually where I gather with a group for after-work drinks or to start off First Friday.
40	5	7	7	8	WHO: If you want to drink somewhere besides a club, and in a hip/cutesy scene, this is you! ...  ... WHERE: #140 Downtown! ...  ... WHEN: They are open everyday at 4pm. ...  ... WHAT: Due to the fact that I am uncultured when it comes to Downtown Las Vegas, my friend decided to take me on a date to hit up all the cool spots in Downtown Las Vegas! During our date, this was our last spot. I guess it's true when they say "SAVE THE BEST FOR LAST" because this was definitely an out of this city experience. ...  ... When you find the bar and walk in, it looks a little intimidating, but DON'T BE FOOLED! As soon as we walked in, I fell in love with everything in there! The bar is inspired by Prague's Strahov Monastery Library, and is absolutely gorgeous! The wall is made of bookshelves with actual books (somewhat like the Library Bar in Los Angeles), the sofas and seats make me feel as if I have left Las Vegas for the night, and the drinks were all so unique, and ones you wouldn't find at your local Las Vegas nightclub. ...  ... I tried The Lady Sylvia because I'm a nerd, but it is now one of my favorite drinks! It has a citrus taste to it, and will make you feel like dancing!! =) ...  ... NOTE: This place is a smoke-free environment though, so smoke outside before you come inside! ...  ... To conclude: If one night you and your friends are bored, make a scavenger hunt out of it and try to find THE LADY SYLVIA. The only clue I leave with you is the number 140. ;) You can do it! =D
40	4	2	2	2	The Lady Silvia is like a hidden bar. Wait, is it hidden? Because I didn't see a sign outside. ...  ... I usually come here when I want to have a good cocktail with friends. The bar is rarely busy unless there's an event. ...  ... Cocktails are moderately priced. Raging from $10 to $15. They have the classic cocktails, I'm talking about the Manhattan, Sazerac, etc. My faves. haha. ...  ... Do come here during the weekends and weekdays. Never busy.
40	4	0	1	0	I'm giving this place four (instead of three) stars for the concept. We were there last night with a few friends. Drinks were good, slightly above average. Seating was trendy, though a little uncomfortable. And the music was far too loud for a lounge.  I agree with a previous yelper, either add a dance floor (please don't) or turn the music down a couple notches!   ...  ... All in all....if you haven't gone, go!
40	5	0	0	0	I love the Lady Silvia.  It's one of the gems in the downtown Vegas area.  It's hip and very chill.  We love The bartenders are all great, especially Tina!
40	4	1	4	2	Came here for a private party and I was very impressed with the venue.  From the layout to the decor and options for alcoholic beverages.  Not to mention, the staff members gave excellent service.   ...  ... I would definitely rent the venue out for a party.  Keep in mind that the venue is small so it probably can't accommodate a  big party.  Although the space is small, it doesn't have that overwhelming suffocating feeling. ...  ... They play awesome music and have happy hour specials too!
40	4	0	1	0	I like this place because it's really cool to take my friends who are visiting from out of town to. It's one of those places you don't even know exists, and wouldn't be able to find unless someone who's been there before brought you. Cool atmosphere, prices are moderate, but it's more of a chill place to get the party started.
40	5	0	1	1	This place is super cool! It's not advertised from the street, so finding it is an adventure unto itself. Luckily, I came with a friend who knew how to find the door.  ...  ... It's not a large space, but that doesn't matter. The vibe is like Alice In Wonderland right after she fell through the rabbit hole, decked out with a graffitied ceiling. Black and White movies playing on silent, with a mix of ambient pop and contemporary house music coming out the speakers. I felt right at home.  ...  ... There were specialty cocktails on their drink menu, one of which I tried. It had blueberry in it; but fell short on wowing me. I was so happy they carry Greygoose Orange, as that's my boozy of choice. Carried on with that for the rest of the night.  ...  ... All in all, I wouldn't hesitate to come to Lady Silvia again. My friend and I had a great time!
40	5	0	0	0	Tina and Dina are the best! Thank you for being the awesome women that you are. Outstanding service.
40	5	0	0	0	Oh, how I love this place. The bartenders are casual and fun; I loved chatting with one of them about her own drink creations on the menu. Also, the service was fantastic! It took a while to find this place, but trust me, the hunt is worth it. Books line the walls on dark shelves while televisions play old black-and-white movies. The floor is checkered in black and white tile while splashes of colors play off of velvet loveseats, chairs and wall panelings. We arrived right before the EDM playlist started; fog machines and lasers added to the incredibly unique and  fun ambiance that is The Lady Silvia. The drinks are strong, the music is fantastic, the people are great and the atmosphere is so quirky... it's perfect.
40	5	1	1	1	Gorgeous bar! Once you find it, you'll realize how easy it is to get to this place! ... Yummy drinks, impeccable service and hip environment, so close to the Premium Outlets. I'm a fan and can't wait to go back.
40	1	0	0	0	Just didn't have any fun here and I don't think I saw one person smiling the whole time I was here...bartenders included.
40	5	0	0	0	This place is so cool and they have GREAT drinks. It makes it more fun that it's a speakeasy, and we had a bit of trouble finding it since it's unmarked. If you are looking for it, it's suite #140 just walk right in. The bartender was super nice and attentive. This is on the "go to" list of awesome bars with excellent drinks.
41	4	0	2	2	Lisa is so nice, and this gallery was and is ahead of its time. William Wegman  is not even the best artists here. See work by Luis Jimenez, Mark Klett and RES.
41	5	5	7	5	This is my favorite gallery in Old Town. Kate C. is right, this gallery is ahead of it's time... especially compared to everything that's going on with Art in Scottsdale. ...  ... The things I see here leave a mark on me and stay engraved in my memory. Trust me, this is hard to do because every Friday and Saturday night I abuse my poor brain with Vodka.  ...  ... My first visit introduced me to Jessica Joslin. Just google her and you'll see why I never forgot about it. She builds these little creatures out of brass, odd mechanical bits and pieces, and did I mention bones?! I imagine her to be a real freak show, but she is probably disappointingly normal. At least as normal as someone who collects bones for the purpose of art can be.  ...  ... Another exhibit showcasing Chinese contemporary artists left a lasting impression on me. Pieces like Digesting Mao, which consisted of red plates with tiny Mao faces in various stages of consumption and crotchless panties exclaiming 'No War' are odd ball enough to stick around even after you've left.   ...  ... This gallery is a refreshing oasis in the cowboy themed desert that is Old Town Scottsdale.
41	4	1	0	1	Good space, largely friendly staff, and certainly a more forward thinking approach than the other places still harboring Native and Folk Art.  Prices were a bit higher than I'd expect for the quality and names they were exhibiting, but they really do seem to have the corner on the market in the genre of progressive modern art.
41	5	0	0	0	A few years ago I wrote a review recommending Lisa Sette Gallery as one of the best in Scottsdale...now I must revise that to read the best in PHOENIX! LSG recently moved to midtown Phoenix, to an amazing building designed by Al Beadle. Go if only to see the new space, which is broad and low-lying and wrapped in a massive scrim of white fabric that reflects the bright light of the Phoenix sun. ...  ... Plus, now there's parking! ...  ... Inside, the space is bigger and better than the Scottsdale location but still a cool, clean, locally-owned gallery and a bastion of sophistication in the desert. I love the way Sette selects her artists among both wunderkind grad students and art-scene luminaries from all over the world. I love how, when interviewed about the move, Sette seemed almost as excited by the bigger kitchen as she did about the incredible new building. ...  ... The gallery's been in operation for over 25 years, and it's clear Sette knows what she's doing; whether in the dry summer months or in season, LSG can be relied upon to fascinate and enchant. I'm always impressed by how so much of the work I see here can be both exquisitely lovely and, simultaneously, challenging and new. Gallery artists are both established names and emerging stars, and they come from all over (including a healthy representation of contemporary artists working in the Southern Hemisphere). Whether exhibiting local or international artists, somehow Sette always manages to strike the right aesthetic balance, so if you're in the area it's always worth checking out what's on show. It helps, of course, that the gallery staff is competent and personable. ...  ... In addition to painting/sculpture/installation, Sette represents a remarkable roster of photographers--If you want to check out the photographs documenting James Turell's massive Roden Crater project in northern Arizona, Sette is the place to go. Ditto if you're in the market for some Starn brothers. Or, even, you know, if you want a good recommendation for a local restaurant.
41	5	0	1	0	This beloved gallery has left the sea of Southwest in Old Town Scottsdale for their new, incredibly hip Midtown digs.  ...  ... Can I just say, I am obsessed? Building designed by Al Beadle. Super cool branding with the new "Hello, Midtown" logo in the entry. Soft light from high windows. It's a great space.  ...  ... I went to the opening and fell in love with a few photos that, coincidentally were also the most affordable thing in the place. Yay, me! I have decided, I haven't made it until I've purchased art from the Lisa Sette Gallery. It's gonna happen one of these days!

He is extremely professional and spends the time with you to understand your situation and explain the solutions for your personal and family needs.  Should you be totally confused with how the government is impacting your health coverage and solutions to make it better for you, I strongly recommend you contact Rob and have him spend some time with you.  You will be glad you did.

With all the new rules and all of the confusing do's and don'ts , you need to put your faith in the hands of someone that can steer you right when you can't seem to make heads or tails of this stuff.  Great person with great options!!!  If you need insurance, then you need Rob!!!

I met with Rob to talk about what health insurance options are out there and what would best fit my needs.  He was very informative and answered every question thoroughly.
44	4	0	0	0	Fun, chic bar designed by the same folks who did Lotus in New York. It has that upscale, big city vibe - complete w/a velvet rope out front and big men in all black. Located in the Venetian (hence the V), it's a fun place to party but the crowd changes depending on what convention is in town.
44	4	0	0	0	Located in the Restaurant Row section of The Venetian, V Bar has a modern, minimalist design with lots of red, black, and white with frosted glass accents. A long bar lines one wall with smaller tables and seating areas around the outside of the room.  ...  ... When you step inside the V Bar, you leave the rest of Vegas behind. There is no sign of a casino in here-- no Keno, no video poker... It is a great place to grab a cocktail in a sophisticated environment. The sound system plays soothing chillout music, trance, and acid jazz... so you are still able to carry on a conversation without feeling the need to scream to be heard.
44	4	0	1	0	In a city full of bars and clubs, this one holds its own by being a dive bar.. only las vegas style... people don't come here in jeans unless their american rag but at least you can get in somewhere with jeans, right? In any case, this is a nice placeto set up shop when you feel like going out, but not going all out.
44	2	0	1	0	Maybe it was the crowd based on the two techie conferences being held at this time...maybe it was the music that was so loud our ears were ringing all night afterwards...maybe it was us -- as no one else seemed to want to sit near us at the side of the room with the comfortable benches against the wall. ...  ... Hundreds of people seemed to be jammed in the area to the right as you walk in, but no one was on our side of the room except the rocking DJ.  The people who were supposed to meet us at the V Bar were told they couldn't go in because it was too crowded.  Am I missing something? ...  ... Maybe it was because I was wearing jeans...
44	5	1	4	3	V-Bar is a great lounge.  We stopped in here for some drinks before having dinner with friends.  You really don't know there is a huge casino outside of it...the couches are dark and the room is inviting.  Its rather small so I would imagine it would get crowded quickly later in the evening. ...  ... Update: ... We went back to V-Bar with friends on a recent trip to Vegas.  We easily were given a table which are really well laid out. I liked the u-shape as it was very conducive to conversation.  Our server was great, she always kept our drinks coming and was very sweet.  The music here is great, it's a good mix of but is never too loud so you can carry on a conversation without screaming.  (Even though I did lose my voice that weekend I don't think it was because of V-Bar!) ...  ... I think V-Bar may be my favorite hotel lounge in Vegas.
44	4	0	0	0	The V Bar is one of those places that combines the beauty of an interior with the bustle of Vegas service. Watch out for the attitude of the doormen, however, the bartenders with fun attitudes make up for any pretentiousness. The drink prices are high, after all its Vegas and the Venetian. Their menu for food is actually quite eclectic with beautiful presentation and solid portions. Recommended if you can be VIP for a night and looking for a relaxing alternative to its sister nightlife venue, Tao.
44	4	0	0	0	Four stars for the fact that they don't have a cover charge! The V bar is nice inside (it sounds louder from the outside than it actually is), and on the night we were there, the dj was playing some fun and classic tunes.
44	5	0	1	0	Looking for a relaxing, contemporary spot to have some cocktails with friends? Look no further!! ... The interior of this bar has always made me feel swanky and warm, the comfy booths are great for conversations and sipping on a martini. ... I don't drink martini's usually, but this place calls for one.  ... It has been open for years, but its right inside the Venetian, and its completely secured so no one can find you if they don't know where to look!!
44	5	0	2	1	I like this place. Went here for a few drinks with some folks before I decided to call it a night.  It wasn't too crowded since it was a weeknight and a nice to chill and chat. I was looking at the drink menu and decided to order a strawberries and cream since it looked good. once i ordered it from the waitress, she mentioned that it wasn't good and that i'd be wasting my money. wow. i've never heard that before. but that was good. i liked her honesty. so i asked her what she would recommend and i took her up on it and had a hynotised (with hypnotiq, pineapple juice and other stuff i can't remember) and a raspberry bellini. both were really good and strong. the music was a great 80's mix and it was fun to people watch. the place itself isn't that big, so i can only imagine how it would be on a weekend night. probably packed.
44	3	0	1	1	Maybe I'm not "hip and cool" but I just didn't get this place.  It seemed like it was a bar trying to be a club that got confused and had schizophrenia.  There was a sort-of rope out front, as if they wanted to start a line, yet we walked right in.  I don't know if the rope was to make the place look cool or desirable???  That sort of schizo feeling continued on into the bar (this is a bar right? not a night club?).  Like it was missing a big dance floor and possibly a light show or something. ...  ... Moving on...the place had some cozy looking couches and tables, but they were all reserved so I didn't get a chance to test if the couches were indeed cozy.  My friend and I grabbed a seat at the bar.  Our bartender was really fast and friendly and made some really strong drinks.  (Major bonus points for her - she was really cool.)  Once we kicked back with our drinks, we enjoyed ourselves.   ...  ... I guess maybe this is the kind of place you come pre-club to get in the mood for the real thing, but whatever.  It was a nice place to relax after a long day and have a well made cocktail.
44	2	0	0	0	The music here is great...we got sick of being packed like sardines, with an inability to move a limb to dance or walk for that matter at TAO so we headed here... ...  ... What SUCKED was the bartenders... took TOO damn long to get a drink.... ...  ... But by 3am...it had cleared out...and we had it to ourselves.
44	5	0	0	0	Free entrance fee but super expensive drinks.  My advice would be to just go gamble at the casino first and get free drinks there.  Just "Keno it up."  Thats what me and my cousins did a couple of weeks ago. The waitresses and bartenders there were really cool.  The enviroment was cool too.  Lots of hot girls.  Great place to chill.
44	3	0	1	1	I was staying at the Venetian, so I decided to meet up with my coworkers at the V Bar after dinner.  It was a Sunday night, so it wasn't too happening.  The atmosphere was nice and relaxed, but it wasn't anything special.   The service was great, a waitress came by to our table whenever our drinks got low.   She was very attentive.  My male coworkers were in heaven because she was so well-endowed.  Haha....men.   ...  ... I would give the V Bar a 3-3.5 star from my one-time experience.
44	5	0	0	1	After fighting through the crowd at the airport lobby, claiming my half open bag at the luggage claim, and waiting in the cold for the shuttle to take us to our hotel...  my spirit was on the lower side...  despite that we were in Vegas, at last.   ...  ... The idea of sipping cocktails in jeans and having audible conversations with friends just seemed so much more pleasant than fighting to get into Pure or Tao on this particular night...  Thanks to Mr. Vegas, our gracious host throughout the weekend, we came to V Bar, which was exactly what we all had in mind.  Nice and chill music.  Sexy yet tasteful decor.  Hot and friendly cocktail waitresses...  We chatted and drank and relaxed...  until 3 in the morning.  What perfect way to ease into the wildness that soon followed.
44	5	0	1	0	I always like this place. Easy to get in. Great for groups. You can actually carry on a conversation without screaming to be heard. ...  ... Granted you have to travel into the casino to find a loo...but hey baby this is vegas, least your drink can go with you! ... So if you're looking for a fun night minus the hassle of a big name club (like studio, light etc)  Try Vbar, you'll be glad you did!
44	4	1	1	2	No Cover? SHOOT!!! WE ARE THERE!!!!!!!!! hahaha.  ...  ... After having issues with TAO, the group decided to head out of the Venetian. On our way out we ran across V Bar and decided to check it out. Large seating area, DJ, alcohol, hot waitress, nice people, dance floor, and my friends around. What more can you ask for!  ...  ... The DJ was playing pretty good music for a bar. Our waitress reminded me of Jenna Jameson (when she's blonde) but taller. She was nice too! There was no cover, the hostess and host in the front were very friendly, the restrooms were close, service was great, and we got to dance without a huge crowd.  ...  ... Only gripe. I wish more people would dance! Not that I really care. I mean my feet were hurting like a mother and I danced anyway, but it's always nice when more people dance. :) ...  ... Happy Birthday Wes!!!!!!!!!
44	3	0	1	2	We checked out V-Bar at the Venetian with some friends on a Friday night. It's small, dark, and intimate and it never got very crowded at all, which was refreshing. Plus any place that doesn't charge a cover is awesome in my book. Service at the bar was quick and attentive, and I thought drinks were reasonably priced by Vegas standards. Music was OK, but not the best I have heard at a lounge. Unless you are staying at the Venetian or Palazzo, however, it's not worth making a special trip for. I think there are better Vegas lounges.
44	4	0	0	0	1.26.08: We needed to go and get in free somewhere. Walked by V Bar, and all of a sudden we were inside. There was actually a DJ Spinning. A cool area where we danced and lounged. ...  ... The drinks were not bad. The DJ was actually good. The vibe was nice and the place was cozy.  ...  ... The restrooms are outside this bar. ha ha. That's the only downfall, everything else was great. The pretty hosts outside was the main attraction. They are pretty white girls. Well I don't know if they were actually white, but whatever.  ...  ... Great place, seriously, really great place..
44	4	0	0	0	i like that it wasn't overly crowded and the music was great! ... maybe i liked the people there because we knew most of them? or maybe the vibe was just different. ... i like the fact that i can chill and then get up and dance and have room to move around. ... the drinks were kinda strong but that's a good thing!
44	3	1	1	1	I went here when I was in Vegas for work. It was a great place to hang with friends and just chill and drink and talk. We even danced a little. ...  ... Overall, tiny place. A few places to sit. A small place to dance - good enough for a group of friends. Nice modern atmosphere. One bar. One night the music was hip hop/top 40 and the next night it was electronica.  ...  ...  ... Just come by to this place to kill some time. No cover and no line. But I wouldn't hang out here the entire night. It would get somewhat boring after a while.
44	3	0	1	0	Modern-looking place in the Venetian hotel that's a great meeting point for a drink after dinner at B&B or a show at the Blue Man. But... it's nothing particularly unusual or outstanding. It's a nice place in a nice hotel. Not much else to say.
44	5	0	1	0	i really enjoyed my first Vegas bar here. I came here twice during my stay in the Venetian. The service from the bartenders were awesome and fast.  They knew what to recommend and stuff. The music was great too. It was definitely more crowded on saturday compared to friday night. i liked how it opened very late. Great place to meet people and just chill. The drinks were strong and some were good.
44	4	0	0	1	Very cool, chill place for some good music and drinks!  You can ever dance a little if the mood catches you right!  Great bartenders and great ambiance!
44	3	1	2	1	Came here a day after Memorial day, so it was kind of dead, but I was okay with that. That meant we got our drinks faster, right? The waitresses and the bartenders were attentive and really nice. They made sure that our empty glasses were taken and that when we needed more drinks, they were right on top of it. The decor was very modern and the seats were comfortable. I'm sure on a busy night, the area where we were sitting would have been bottle service or VIP. I would come here again for  more drinks if we decided to opt out of a club night or if you need to kill some time. I did notice that the crowd was a little older, I did noticed a group of cougars prowling and having some drinks and there were a lot of middle aged couples, too. That could kill the vibe of the bar, but it didn't.
44	4	2	1	1	TINY and narrow! Two adjectives that are not very good for bars. However, there are pluses: No cover..check. Strong drinks..check. Nice bartenders..check.  ...  ... My friend and I snuck our way through the crowd and snagged a seat front and center right at the bar. We initially tried to go to a different club (brain fart is preventing me from recalling the name at the moment!) but the cover they were asking was insane ($80 for girls!) and from what we heard, $100+ for guys. Pssh, yeah right I don't think so! ...  ... So V Bar it was, and nothing's sweeter than free, especially on Memorial weekend. Since by the time we finally got back to our hotel, we had to play catch up because our night started at 1 a.m., which is typically when we're close to finishing it!  ...  ... We downed red bull vodkas and the bartender kept serving 'em up. There was this annoyingly drunk and horny couple next to us that kept bumping my friend and performing putrid PDA's for all to see. There was also a creepy guy who just walked up to my friend, stared at her, then spilled his drink on her new dress; when she got up and shrieked, he told her that she didn't have to be so rude about it! LOL, drunk people are great-they make no sense whatsoever!
44	4	2	1	2	Like others have said about V bar, it is really chill.  The music is good and the place is small enough you can see everyone around you.  If you want to dance, you can.  We had a few tables and it is a good place just to hang out with your friends and not worry about skanky bitches bumping into you and spilling their drinks on you.   ...  ... I would def go back.
44	3	1	1	1	Maybe a 3.5- the dj was decent ...  ... Saturday nite in Vegas, and my friends and I didn't feel like waiting in line, or tipping a door man big money to get in, so we looked for something else.  Enter V-Bar.  V-bar had a decent amount of people in it, and no cover.  No cover??  Doesn't sound bad, until you see the price of drinks, and that's where they catch you.  Oh well, we want to party, so we head in. ...  ... The place is pretty small.  There are two parts to this place, to the left you have private booths, and a pseudo dance floor, and to the right you have the bar, and more booths, but they're more open.   The crowd is mostly young professionals, though there was a party of cougars surprsingly drawing quite a bit of attention from some of the younger men. ...  ... The place never really reached capacity, which was nice, and after a while, when the place began to clear out, there was enough room to dance.  I guess we should've planned out the evening a little better, but this place wasn't bad, just not great.  I wouldn't say this bar distinguished itself from any other hotel bar.  I probably wouldn't go back, but I wouldn't discourage peopel from checking it out.  There is certainly some people watching to be done.
44	3	0	0	0	Totally chill environment here, came here on a Tuesday night after we discovered how wack Pure was.  Unfortunately by the time we got here, we decided we were more hungry than thirsty so we headed over to Noodle Asia instead.  That and this place was totally dead, only had maybe a handful of patrons in there.  But I'm sure if we had more folks with us, we would have brought the party to them!
44	4	0	0	0	small and pretty fun when you bring your own crowd with ya ... no cover charge at all and one of the door people is a really hot asian chick who actually drank with me when she was escorting people out during last call ... the drinks may be pricey but when your in vegas you are expected to drop something, so yeah it beat out those long waits to get into tao or paying big dudes to just let us in ... every night we were in vegas we would go to a club and somehow end the night over here ... there was one night we went here then headed over to scores and didnt come back to our room till like 9am, good times ... which reminds me i have to call that door lady back, hehe ... definitely a 'cozy' place to chill at, a hidden gem  ... great music, small dance floor, awesome drinks, vibing atmosphere
44	3	0	0	0	I went here on Wednesday night.  I had read the reviews on Yelp and wasn't sure what to think.  Anyway since it was our first night in Vegas, me and my girlfriends figured we wanted to try a small bar/lounge.  It was definitely a chill spot.  It was fairly empty but they had good music and the beers were reasonably priced.  Definitely a good spot to go to on a first date or if you're looking for a relaxing evening with good music and drinks :)
44	3	6	6	6	i guess this is where those who get rejected by tao come...j/k :) ...  ... after that horrible experience at tao, we stumbled across this place.  we saw a short line formed outside the entrance and hesitated since we no longer bear to stand in our 3 inch high heels.  but we were in vegas for a bachelorette party and our "to-do" list had to be completely checked off before the night was over.  we inquired about a table service with the hostess, and it turned out to be much more economical than we had anticipated ($200 a bottle with minimum of 2 bottles).   ...  ... this bar/lounge is small but has enough sitting areas along the walls.  the dj was spinning top 40 songs and occasionally michael jackson's (c'mon, "billy jean" is a classic).  our table service was more than adequate and sufficient as they constantly brought new glasses and cleaned the area for us.   ...  ... i liked that this place had enough lighting.  this helped us tremendously when we were picking guys to help us accomplish the missions on that "to-do" list since they were chosen purely based on their looks (if the bachelorette had to take a body shot, looks matter...trust me!).
44	4	0	2	1	Exactly what Lena B. said.. ...  ... Came here as an alternative since Tao had a FAAAAT ass line this past weekend.  It was our bad tho, we arrived around 12am.  My friends got hooked up in front of the line but they were waiting on me, my sister, her bf, and his brother who was still on the way.  I felt soo bad that they could've gone in w/ ease but of course they were asked to move out of line.  Oh wells.  Vbar was still crackin.  Short line and no cover.  All good.  Music was cool.  Basically felt like any normal club in SF since the dance floor was really small, but they had great comfy booths.  Bartenders are nice and environment was chill.  I had a great time =)
44	4	0	0	0	This place is great if you don't like dealing with the club scene in Vegas.  The DJ was great, playing mostly hip-hop from the golden era (96-02).  This lounge has NO LINE and NO COVER which is my kinda place, yet still gives you a good experience.  The drinks were OK and around $8 a piece.  It definitely worth checking out if you want a club alternative.
44	4	1	1	2	No cover, no lines, no strict dress code, good music/music video djing, and ding ding ding!!! great MOJITOS!!!! ...  ... Damn those mojitos ($13)...why am I so in love with this sweet concoction?? maybe because IF they're made right..they taste so good that you don't even know you're drinking something alcoholic. So great job V bar for making my favorite drink taste so damn good and so sad for me cause I got fricking wasted. Pre party cran-vodkas don't mix well with 4 mojitos...you  probably know how my night ended. ...  ... Oh..and even though there is a dj...there isn't really a set dance floor..no one was dancing so my party had to start it up and after that, everyone was boogeying away..also a plus for the nice comfy couch seating for those who didn't want to dance and just people watch.
44	5	1	1	1	THIS PLACE IS SO GREAT, I WENT THERE TWICE IN ONE WEEKEND! ...  ... I am the type of guy who LOVES Vegas but I hate spending money!  You know how the clubs are, you pay 20 bucks to get in and then pay $15 for one drink!  Well, you need to try the bars and lounges in the hotels!  You can find the V Bar at the Venetian and it's so rad!  There is NO cover and drinks are half the price that you would pay at a regular club in Vegas!  This is how I roll!   ... I loved this place so much I went back the 2nd night I was in Vegas and ran into the same people!  The vibe is really chill and you meet a ton of really great people!
44	4	0	1	0	I have never been here before nor have I heard of it, but it is a definite find. No line, no cover, nice wait staff, and cheap bottles (at least in Vegas). Its more of a lounge (aka you can hear what your friends are saying to you) which is a nice change of pace.  ...  ... I wouldn't go expecting the "club experience" but it is a nice alternative to going to one of the countless bars in Vegas.
44	3	0	0	0	A decent bar with loungey atmosphere. It's a great place to chill out before heading to a club, especially when there's seats. Drinks were inexpensive compared to some other places. Went there after clubs but there was no place left to sit, so didn't stay around. Good music selection, and I liked the movie screen thing that projects against the walls, visible to people outside. It was neat.
44	4	1	1	1	perfect post pre party( cause the pre party is in your suite right? ) before you walk into tao or any other nightclub .  ...  ... cheap drinks(for vegas) + cool dj = good times.  ...  ... if you get there a bit early you can go ahead and lounge around the sofas - before all the big ballers reserve all of them with their mighty bottle service. ...  ... I actually had so much fun the first night there that I wanted to start the second night there too.
44	4	0	2	2	Yup, I'm a fan of this place. As much as I would have loved to go to Tao, I'm not in the mood to pay 20-30 bucks for cover. So what if the experience isn't the same? At least you don't have to surrender an arm and a leg for a drink.  ...  ... Music here was pretty good, considering the DJ was a friend of my buddy who I rolled with. As a result, we were allowed in the VIP section, which led to some awesome bottle service. It's quite a perk when you know the DJ.  ...  ... Its nice to know that there's no line, the wait staff is super nice and attentive, the bar isn't too crowded, the drinks are cheaper, and you have easy in-and-out access for the entire night. I have witnessed people stumble out of the club to the bathroom down the hall and come back with bloodshot eyes from vomiting, only to go for another round inside. I'm not too proud in saying that I myself was one of those people, but then again, its Vegas.  ...  ... As far as aesthetics go, it looks like your typical dimly lit Strip Casino bar. Nothing special really. So if going to the high end clubs isn't your thing anymore, or if you're not willing to cough up money for cover and expensive drinks, this makes a good alternate. Seriously.
44	4	1	2	1	A great place to go unwind after the stuffy craziness that is Tao. If you actually want to hear each other speak, this is a good place to go. There are still a handful of people dancing here, but the best thing about this place is that you can sit down on the nice comfy chairs and not have to pay a ridiculous premium. No cover, you can sit down, and good music -- you really can't lose!
44	4	3	4	3	Uhmmm... I think I had a good time? Yea, I think I did.  ... We went on a Wednesday so it wasn't busy which is fine with me.  ...  ... Our bartender was really friendly, cute and had nice eyebrows (don't ask). We trusted him with making our drinks! The first was a strawberry drink which was deliciousss.  ... The second one? Well I asked him what was in it and all he said was, "it's grape koolaid" (my least favorite). ... I sipped on it... and sipped... and forced myself to finish it. ...  ... I would definitely want to go back on a busier night. It seems as though it could get really fun.
44	4	0	0	1	This place is a sentimental fave of mine.  My husband and I had just gotten married and were having a small reception at Canaletto in the Venetian.  After seeing the line at Tao and told it was $2000 a bottle, we declined and just happened to find this place as we were coordinating something else to do with our friends.  So the price was right, we got our own booth, and it was just perfect for what we were celebrating.  They even through in some comp shots and champange.  Service from our waitress was excellent (she would slap our hand if we tried to make a drink).  This is the way bottle service should be!  We asked the DJ to play us a "wedding" song for our first dance and it ended up being "Love in this Club".  Awesome.  He also through in the electric slide later for nostalgic purposes.  Fun, fun night.  One of the best.
44	1	1	6	2	Dropped by with a group of friends on 6/12/09.  The bouncer told us there was a cover charge of $20 which we didn't expect.  We had checked out the website prior to going.  A friend showed the bouncer the website on his phone which clearly read "Never a cover."  This should convince him right? ...  ... Nope, he then tells us their policy changed 2 weeks ago but the website isn't updated yet.  It takes over 2 weeks for the Venetian to change a few words on a webpage?  I don't think so. ...  ... I don't care if I need to pay cover, but this was shady enough for me to walk away.  Theres plenty of other places to goto in Vegas anyways.
44	4	0	0	0	I read some of the other reviews, but my experience was much more positive. We went on a Sunday night and it was perfect. It wasn't super packed and the bartenders were cool. Drinks weren't super expensive.  It was comfy but had room for moving/ dancing.
44	1	0	2	1	Annoyed because we came here Saturday night because there was supposed to be no cover.  $20 for men, $10 for women...bullshit. ...  ... Walked in, place was pretty barren.  Walked right out. ...  ... Maybe it's cool when there's no cover and other people are there, but I wasn't sticking around to figure that out.
44	5	0	3	2	This place was totally chill on a Tuesday night. I had the Lychee martini and the raspberry martini.  ...  ... There was no cover. The drinks were excellent and the service was superb. I can't find anything wrong with this place.  ...  ... I would definitely recommend it on a weeknight. Great lighting!
44	2	0	0	0	This place was ok.  Not a happening place kinda empty when we got there @ 12:30.  This place is more of a lounge not a club.   Drinks were good and service was fast but this place was kinda boreing.  This place would be a place to get some drinks before clubbing.  ...  ... -p2
44	5	0	0	0	Vbar was a great place to hang out. It's not as packed as Tao or Lavo and there aren't any cover charges during the week like Tao and Lavo. It was the best place to chill and have a good time at the Venetian.
44	3	0	2	1	The music at V Bar is usually hip hop and it's never too crowded.  I would say V Bar is a secondary destination for those that either couldn't get into Tao or didn't want to wait in line any longer.  I usually go there to pre-game or support the DJ.  It's a good-sized lounge and the bar is nearly the length of the room. ...  ... There is a dress code but if you're out on a weekend, then you should be in character already.  Not the greatest place to conduct business, but transactions can be made--especially after 2am.
44	5	0	3	2	I went back about a month ago and even though it was a Friday night and they were charging a cover, they let me in for free since I was with a local.  ...  ... BTW - did you know that all locals get into these clubs and bars for free?  ...  ... The service was great and the drinks more than tolerable. I just like the vibe here.
44	4	0	0	0	Went there about 6 months ago and this lounge is great if you want a break from the big box clubs that Vegas offers. The decor is nice but nothing cutting edge on a worldly level. The drinks are priced decently and the service is great. The talent can fluctuates best on the events happening in or around the Venetian. The beauty of its location is that it sits right in the middle of the stripe! ...  ... If the talent was more consistent and the decor was a little more avant garde, I would definitely give this place 5 stars. Come on this is Vegas!!!!! This an easy thing to do and globetrotters expect this!!!!LOL!
44	4	0	1	0	Great place to just hang out and chill... no lines, DJ's, decent crowd, minimal dress code, and just a short walk from the casino floor.  Service was pretty good as there are plenty of bartenders so no long waits for the drinks.  On the otherhand, the dj's aren't that great all the time.  But overall, a pretty good place to have some drinks and meet up or wind down with your friends.
44	2	10	13	9	V Bar is basically just a bar... with over-priced drinks... It would earn 3 stars except for the COVER CHARGE... ...  ... I'm not sure why anyone would pay cover here ($20 each including for girls!) instead of going to the much cooler Tao right upstairs. I got into this discussion/argument with my cousin when she generously paid our cover charges... I tried to convince her that I'd just ask for the cover back but instead we just went in...  ...  ... We danced a bit with much older people on the dance floor (and not many people at all at that) and couldn't sit because the tables were just for table service (but, again, this is just a small-ish bar). We drank a bit too and at least the drinks were good and the bartenders were nice.  ...  ... I probably won't be back here and definitely won't be back here if they keep charging cover!!!
44	3	0	0	0	If you're by the Venetian and want to chill and have a drink or two, this place is cool. Also can be a spot to hit up after a Tao if you're all partied out but this want to to chill.
44	3	0	0	0	Chill spot if you wanna get away from the BIG club scene. Got in for free and there was no dress code. Place is a bit small. ...  ... DJ played hip-hop at first then changed to rave music. No thanks. ...  ... I would have gave an extra star if they played hip-hop all night.
44	4	0	1	1	pretty chill spot and not like other vegas lounges/bars. there is a decent sized dance floor, fully stocked bar, seating along the walls, a few booths one can reserve for bottle service or smoking hooka, and brings in a good crowd. ...  ... there is no cover for local ladies, the drinks are kind of pricey, and the dj on thursday nights plays a good variety of new and old skool hip hop and some top 40. ...  ... pricey - $12 tequila shot ...               $5 corona ...  ... overall experience, 4 star!
44	3	0	0	0	I don't often frequent these types of places but I was in a pretty big group of people, which helped take the edge off since I didn't have to do any talking. It's a nice low-key spot for hanging out and relaxing with friends. Everyone there was pretty cool and friendly. There wasn't any stalking or bad vibes coming from other tables. Even though it's not that big of a place we were still able to make use of the little area that's designated as the dance floor. I'm glad we came here instead of Tao since it wasn't shoulder to shoulder crowded. Overall I can honestly say that I had a good time here albeit I'm sure the alcohol contributed to that.
44	4	0	0	0	Came here with my husband, his best friend and girlfriend for his birthday on a Wednesday night and the music was great but it was dead which was expected on a Wednesday night...It's small yet cozy and the drinks were reasonable
44	4	2	3	2	Looking to have a good time? V Bar LV!  ...  ... I'm going to be brief:  ... 1.) Service is decent ... 2.) Beautiful atmosphere and extremely spacious lounge areas  ... 3.) Great place to kick it with friends. Laid back scene with friendly people just ready to have a good time.  ...  ... There are just so many places in Vegas that make you feel like a sardine. If your down to be attacked and crammed in a club go to XS.  ...  ... The owner or one of the bouncers was extremely friendly. There was a small incident that occurred with a server and the owner/bouncer came over and personally handled it. It was awesome. ...  ... I would highly suggest this place if you want to pre game or end a night. My favorite aspect of V bar? Your really free to be loud, dance, get rowdy and no one really complains. Overall a great spot to kick it and have fun.
44	4	0	2	1	10/7/2010 ...  ... I attended latin night, what a nice change on the strip.  it's good to experience some culture in Vegas vs. most nights being the same mix of top 40 hip-hop/house.  Beautiful venue, I got in for $20, and mingled with some fyne latinas!  Thursday night was crowded but not  to the point I couldn't move.  I'll B back
44	2	0	0	1	Was not a the happening place on Sunday night. Barely anyone was there and they kept asking for Bottle Service but for what? Everyone was just at the bar. Thank god we didn't have to pay to get in. Overall its a place to hang out and the music was not bad. Maybe I will stop by next time in Vegas and hope its more hopping.
44	3	0	0	0	Always end up here, good music good drinks and like how it's kind of hidden. Great for people who like to dance a little and hates big crowds...
44	5	0	0	0	I would recommend this place to anyone, great atmosphere great staff, you never know who you're gonna run into, Marlon Wayans , Wayne Brady, MTVs Americas best dance crew SuperCr3w, JABBAWOKEEZ , Kabba Modern, it's a hidden Gem, its spot to go to between Tao n Lavo.
44	3	0	0	0	It was definitely a convenient location but a small area, which became easily cramped. The bartenders could also learn how to make drinks too.
44	3	0	0	0	Was there for a private event. The first thing i noticed was the rediculously skimpy outfits on the servers. I guess that is normal for vegas, but it detracted from the experience for me. ...  ... The food they catered was pretty bad. ...  ... The redeeming aspect of the locale was that they made a decent mint julep. The waitress didnt know what one was, but she asked the tender and got it done. That made me happy :)
44	5	0	0	0	THis is a cool laid back hookah bar/lounge.  This is a good lounge to just chill at, maybe on a weeknight or night when all the big clubs aren't as crackin.   ...  ... The cool things about this place:  No cover.  You don't have to fight through hella people to get a drink.  Good music.   ...  ... The weak thinks about this place: Older people. ...  ... If you can't get into Lavo or don't feel like clubbing, go to V Bar.
44	4	0	0	0	I was with a group of 7 girls and we were looking for a somewhat low-key night. We went to V Bar and it was so much fun! The bouncers were friendly and the cocktail waitresses were really attentive. We sat in one of the lounge areas and never waited more than 5minutes for our drinks. The DJ played great music and we danced for most of the time we were there. The crowd was pretty mixed and all in all it was a good time! Definitely go if you're looking to dance without being stepped on or groped!
44	4	0	1	1	Laid back lounge, not in the heart of the Vegas party scene, but a great find to hold something intimate - to start or end your night. ...  ... Came here to catch up with some cousins. The place wasn't packed on a Tuesday night, so everyone was able to sit around the modern-decor chairs and light-up tables. The servers came by every 15 minutes asking for more drinks. Music is loud, but conversation is possible. Hookah is also provided here, but I did not partake. ...  ... Tucked in between the Venetian and Palazzo. No cover when I went, not crowded - and meant to be that way.
44	5	1	2	2	Great bar, gorgeous women, all around a good time.  This is one of the few places that I would say is well worth the cover charge.  Go with the bottle service - the initial investment is high but it will definitely save you money in the long run!
44	4	1	1	1	V-Bar saved our night after a horrible time at Tao. I should have learned my lesson about Tao from my very very first trip to LV, but for some reason we ended up trying to go to Tao and left disappointed, YET AGAIN! ...  ... So we left the POS Tao and headed down to V-Bar. Wasnt too crowded, but it doesn't really get poppin till about 1am-ish when people start leaving Tao and come down here.  ...  ... Pretty chill place, DJ was on point with the jams and theres no real dance floor just an open space near the entrance so people just dance there. TV's were on showing the music video that went with the song playing. ...  ... Overall, I enjoyed this place and you should go to V-Bar if one of two happens... ...  ... 1. Your night is ruined because you go to shitty ass Tao thats packed like sardines. ...  ... 2. Your "guest list" connection fails on you and you have no other place to go. ...  ... [BELIEVE me, I've been in both situations lol]
44	2	0	1	0	I first heard about this place when I was a guest at the Venetian. Every night I stop by here, it's dead as a duck. It's a very laid back kinda of bar with ambient type music and occasionally hiphop. The seats are super comfortable but it's so boring and empty here...  ...  ... If you want some private time with your significant other and have a drink, this place might be for you. If you want to party and have a great time, look else where.  ...  ... *Tip - Since this place is right before the entrance to the Blue Man Group, grab a drink or two before catching the show.
44	5	4	0	1	This is a tiny bar with some couches that seems to try to be fancy. I really don't know how having a drink and chilling with people would be different here than in your own hotel room. I think its serves as a pretty good pit stop before going to somewhere bigger, better, and more interesting. ...  ... So why 5 stars? Because I was here at 5pm, ordered a a lychee martini (they call it a Lotus Blossom i think), and it was super good. PLUS, and here is the 5 star part, after we ate the first decorative lychee, the bartender brought over TWO MORE LYCHEES! JACKPOT!!!!!  Yeah I am easy like that. Admittedly we were the only people there, but I felt I had a connection at V bar. A lychee connection.
44	5	0	0	0	Had a great time this weekend for Labor Day!! Thanks for a kick as experience :)
44	5	0	1	2	Best place to start your party at with bottle service starting at  $200 plus great service and great atmosphere. stop by tonight ask for simon at the door 7027427430
44	4	0	0	0	There are many funny memories in this bar. Probably the most notable was watching election returns years ago and seeing Florida called wrong. My friend Shelly predicted the market would crash and she was so right.  ...  ... So, on the last trip to Vegas for a conference, I stopped into the V Bar for a glass of wine. There's not a very wide selection so I went with the bartender's recommendation, a generic Pinot Noir.  ...  ... I realized the V Bar is really smaller than I thought. I called tested a few friends who showed and we had a wonderful time. Nice place with funny memories.
44	3	0	0	0	Went on a Saturday night of Labor day weekend and there was a cover.  It wasn't expensive but the place is not that big at all.  You walk in and pretty much see the whole room from one end to another.  They have a few tables and a long bar.  The dance floor is really small.  The DJ that night played some good songs, but definitely not the same as a club.  They have hookah here so if you are just there to chill that is something you can do.  Drinks are  average priced.
44	4	0	0	0	Visited V Bar for the first time last night and was pleasantly surprised. Great atmosphere and good music. My guests from Holland loved it. Affordable, fun with good service. Jorge, one of the hosts got us a great table and bottle service. Thanks for accommodating our large group. It was great start to our night. Thanks Jorge for a great time. We will definitely come back.
44	3	0	1	0	I was here for the hookah at 11.  We were able to snag a table and enjoy some drinks.  I had the Lychee martini, which was amazing.  The hookah, we had some issues with but our waitress was really easy to work with and she came around often to make sure we were having a good time.  No restrooms in the place though, you have to exit and walk around - which was a bit of a pain, but do-able.
44	4	0	1	2	The V Bar is perfect for a bar that serves as a Prequel to the begining of a great night. Vegas is all about going BIG right, but you have to crawl befor you walk. You come in and the music is good, order drinks and your feeling good. The V Bar also serves Hooka's  so you can toke up different flava's such as cherry, apple or even mango. Overall its refreshing to be able to chill and have drinks with friends before you lose your mind, money or self respect in crazy ass Vegas.
44	4	1	0	1	First night ever in Vegas and didn't know where to go, so I went to this place with a friend. Just wanted drinks and to my surprise, they had hookahs too! It was super hard to track down the guy running the hookahs (even though the lounge wasn't that big), and service was horrible. Because it took the guy 30+ mins to get back to us, we sat on these speakers and got our hookah for free. Perhaps it was the "free" part that made the experience all that sweeter (and worth an extra star).
44	3	0	0	1	A nice little lounge with no cover, located right next to the Blue Man Theatre at the Venetian. ...  ... Definitely a very chill and laid back place that plays good music and serves $10 drinks. ...  ... Come here to relax before a big night out, or after gettin hyphy hyphy somewhere else.
44	4	0	4	3	I am upgrading V Bar to four stars after my visit on Saturday evening with my sister. This lounge was better than I remembered. After dinner at Lavo and some gambling at the Palazzo, we walked over to V Bar for some drinks. It was a little after 9 pm when we arrived and walked right in and settled down at the bar. Service was quick and really friendly for the couple of hours we were there, and our five drinks cost me $51 after tip (3 cocktails and 2 beers). This is a great lounge for couples and groups since there is plenty of seating at the bar and at their U-shaped tables. The music mix was great and not loud enough where you had to yell to be heard. ...  ... I don't remember V Bar having hookah last time I was there a few years ago, but they have it now and have quite a list of flavors. My sister is a not a smoker so no hookah for me this trip, but I will definitely keep it in mind for my next trip out to Vegas.
44	5	0	0	1	Always a good time. Table and bar service better than most bars/lounges/night clubs in Vegas.
44	5	0	2	1	Best bar in the Venetian! I am in Vegas for a conference. After realizing the line at Lavo would take at least an hour (per the bouncer) despite the fact that our group had rented out the space, I checked Yelp and found the VIP managers (Jorge) personal number. After a few extremely helpful texts assuring us no cover, a bunch of us headed over there, tweeting that we were going and for the rest of our group to follow. Michelle at the door was really nice and let us right in. All toll about 50 of us ended up there and had a great night! The drinks are extremely reasonable for this casino ($8 for a rum and coke, $8 for wine, etc) and there is hookah for a respectable $25. The DJ was great and had us all dancing. I was blown away by how much the staff went out of their way for our group and truly saved our night!
44	3	0	0	0	Stopped off in V Bar Saturday after dinner for a quick drink with friends. Had a Stella and chilled by the bar. It was pretty quiet when we were there, which is never a problem for me - I'd actually prefer it that way. The spot is great - the music was good - however, all I kept thinking while in there was "Vegas chicks have gone down..." Yuck! If you are looking for hot girls or guys - this is NOT the bar for you. I was not, but you know me - I can't help how observant I am to these things. Anyways, V Bar served their purpose for us - a few drinks and we were on our way. I did notice they had hookah! I guess that's a nice touch, considering the staff and crowed aren't anything nice to look at.
44	4	0	0	0	This is a great small lounge area... it's reasonably quiet inside so you can still maintain a conversation.  The music is also consistently good too which is a nice plus.  Drinks were strong which was good... a bit pricey, but worth it.  There is no cover charge which is great as well.  Overall, one of my favorite hang-out places in Vegas!
44	5	0	0	0	I love this bar. I go every time I'm in Vegas. The drinks are excellent, the service wonderful and the vibe is great - but relaxed enough that we can stop in wearing somewhat casual clothes and be treated like old friends. Recommend it!!  We sat at the Bar.
44	3	0	0	0	Nice ambience, and not too crowded with the usual douchy type clientele I was expecting. It was chill and the DJ was spinning some pretty hip tunes. ...  ... We got a sitting area all the way in the back to hit the hookah and have some drinks with our group of ladies. ...  ... We didn't order that many drinks or have bottle service, so we were forgotten about pretty quickly. ...  ... The drinks were good, midori sours were yummy and the mango flavored tobacco in the hookah was really nice...however we could've used one more hose on it so we wouldn't  have to keep passing it back and forth so much. ...  ... All in all, nice experience and no drunken drama from anyone there!
44	5	0	0	0	I loved this bar. The night I went there was a cover charge for guys only of $10. The dress code for guys is as simple as a polo. We got a hookah that was $25, which I think is cheap for Vegas. I drank champagne at $9 a glass. I liked that it wasn't too crowded and didn't have a huge line to get in.The place is small but there is a small area for dancing. Overall its a nice small lounge that I definitely recommend!
44	4	0	0	0	Good place.... we had fun there it was not packed which for our kind of night was not bad....... will be back there again....
44	3	0	0	0	Wanted to go here for a chill night to start our Vegas trip, but it was a little TOOOOO chill.   I think I came in wanting something more upbeat and more opportunities to people watch, but this wasn't the place to go.   ...  ... However, there are some pros: ... 1) no cover ... 2) great service ... 3) spacious ... 4) opportunities to dance if you don't care that other people are watching you. ...  ... Cons: ... 1) not too crowded ... 2) drinks were kind of weak ... 3) older crowd ...  ... Go here to grab a couple of drinks before clubbing, but not to hang out all night.
44	3	0	0	0	Small venue well located. The bartenders are good and quick. I was happy that I didn't pay for my drinks or my admission. Overall the space is small, but it will do in a pinch. I can't say how it is on normal nights due to the fact that it was rented out.
44	4	1	1	1	giving this place 4 stars for what it is, a cool "overflow/end up/locals" lounge and bar, or aka DIVE w/bells and whistles ...  ... I usually drop by here whenever i'm in town just because and everytime it's goodtimes, what I mean by overflow/end up, well for whatever reason if you couldn't get into the bigger mainstream clubs like TAO upstairs you might overflow/end up here, this is also a cool place to start the night off ...  ... cover is usually free but I also been hit up for $10 bucks before, so I guess it depends on who's running the front ...  ... the place is "L" shaped with VIP sections lined all along the sides, the bar itself is huge and accomodates a large area for its size, staff works the bar with experience, don't think I spent more than 10 minutes ordering given the amount of ppl, big plus, drinks average around $8 for my usual vodka pineapples ...  ... music played top 40, hip hop, light on the old skool, and electronic ...  ... its not a dance club and real estate can be an issue if its packed, regardless it hits 4 major points, free or cheap cover (in/outs ok), good bar, good music, mixed crowd
44	4	1	2	2	Friends visiting in town other week. We were looking bar/restaurant we could watch NBA finals have some drinks and talk stories. We walked around the Palazzo and Venetian. We decided too check this place out none of us been. It way too early for the place too be packed but actually worked out perfect for us. We pretty much for most part had whole section too ourselves front and center too one of the widescreen above. The service was great hostess very friendly asked about if they were showing the game she like go in, server she was great too attentive never had too worry about our drinks running out, and not sure if all the time give us mix of nuts munch on with drinks. Not place normally hang out but always good mix things up in life. Smaller upscale lounge V bar is pretty cool place too hang out.
44	5	0	0	0	Had my 25th birthday party at Vbar and Jorge and his team were phenomenal!  They definitely made my birthday as hassle-free as possible.  All of my guests had a great time and the DJ played really good music.  Bottle prices were better than reasonable, considering Vbar is on the strip and the waitresses' personable service.  Definitely recommend if you and your friends don't want to deal with big crowds and looking for a place on the strip that's chill, but fun.
44	5	0	0	0	This is not a club.  It's a bar, hence the name V Bar. One of my favorite spots in Vegas for bottle service,  with a couple of the most professional and hospitable people in Vegas; Jorge (VIP Host) and Yulianna (Bottle Service ).Their level of service surpasses that of larger venues in town. If you want a mega club with a bunch of youngsters go elsewhere,  want an intimate spot for the grown and sexy come to V Bar.Singles, couples, or groups can have a great time here, drinking,  dancing,  mingling. Saturday nights the DJ spins hip hop. I am never disappointed with this spot.
44	4	0	0	0	Went to  V-bar before our dinner at Delmonico at about 6:00 on a Friday night.  The place was nearly empty but that was fine by me as it was nice and relaxing before dinner.  We were there for HH which did not include cocktails, only wine and well drinks. ...  ... Hubby got a Jack and Ginger Ale hoping that JD would count as well liquor (it didn't).  I got a $14 Orange Creamsickle martini which was one of the best cocktails I've ever had in my life.  I'll go back there on our next trip just to have another one.  Defintely a place to check out if you're in the area.
44	3	0	0	0	Short Review: ... I've been to V Bar about twice and both times it was to support my home girl who was go go dancing there.  It's pretty small for a lounge but an okay spot for just grabbing a quick drink in the Venetian.  Oh, I remember seeing and meeting Quest Crew here because they got a table...that was a pretty cool night.
44	2	0	1	0	$30 hookah, meh service...and it was completely dead when we went. The saving grace? Really great cocktails. Bottoms up!
44	3	0	0	1	Been here twice now so I think its safe to give a review. Each time I go, its more of a low-key scene and that's what I like. Good DJs and decent priced drinks. ...  ... I like that we can get tables without having to pay for bottle service. The hookah service is decently priced, however, I'm not too confident in their hookah staff's knowledge. The hookahs are always harsh and it seemed like we were smoking more ash than anything. I ordered a mint mixed with fruit flavor and barely tasted anything but a hint of something that tasted like a watered down fruit roll-up. ...  ... They could use some improvement on the quality of hookah they're serving. It's not hard, just takes some research. Perhaps some better coals to have smoother smoke as well. It could just be me, because I almost wanted to go in the back and set up the hookah just as I do at home, but I expected a little more quality at $30 bucks a bowl. Rhumbar at the Mirage does a pretty decent job. ...  ... Drinks were decently priced and the service was good. Everyone was friendly. The music the last time I went was on point also. It's good place to party with your friends without the crazyness of an XS or Tao venue.
44	3	0	0	0	I'm lost for words with this place... we were asked by the doormen to come in..... and when we did, it was like completely dead.  We had to leave because it was so, um....boring?!  not sure if it was the music or drinks, but the owners need to do something fast or else this place may go out of business.
44	5	0	0	0	Went back to VBar this weekend. Had a great time as usual. The service was top notch. Me and the boys don't really go out unless we're getting a table somewhere and Jorge always makes sure we get taken care of. What's nice about this place is even if bottle service isn't your thing, it's still spacious enough to have a good time. The DJ spins hip hop on Saturdays and unlike most DJ booths these days you can actually put in a request; and he'll play it. The crowd ebbs and flows so even if you show up and it's slow all I can say is don't leave because the party always appears just when you think it might not. I've gone out to all the biggest venues in Vegas for the last decade, but now I'm over the super club and much prefer the upscale bar/ultra lounge scene. Right now VBar is my stop at least once every trip.
44	4	1	4	3	After partying hard the night before; this is a great place to hang out and mingle with friends. There are a ton of VIP tables but every time I've come here, I've never seen this place more then a third full. Mixed drinks are about $10-12, Beers around $6-7.  ...  ... Music can get a little loud, but I think that's the only downside. Waitresses are very pretty and super nice. They added on hookah which was $30 for one bowl or $65 for unlimited bowls, which is a great deal if you plan on being there all night. There's a cigar shop a few stores down from V Bar that you can also smoke inside.  ...  ... Just a really chill place to hang out. I'm surprised this place  is rarely busy, but I don't mind it!
44	4	0	0	0	Staff hella cool! Drinks good! Setting nice! Worthy of a check out!
44	3	0	0	0	If you are looking for a chill place in the casino, this would be it.   ...  ... I think of it more of a hookah lounge/bar.  They try to sell you VIP tables, the few times I have been here, coming from a Las Vegas local, you won't need it.  Its not that busy of a bar so getting your drinks is quick.  I think of this place more of a prefunk for the club, or an after party lounge.   ...  ... Usually the music is video mash ups so when it not too busy to people watch, you can video watch, haha.
44	4	12	17	13	V Bar may be my second favorite bar in all of Vegas! ...  ... Located on the casino floor of the beautiful Venetian Hotel, V Bar is a decent sized place that offers happy hour deals from 5-8pm, 7 days a week.  ... The inside of V Bar is dimly lit, with a large L shaped bar, quite a few booths, soft benches and a dance floor. After 9pm V Bar becomes a nightclub that features a DJ, hookah and more. Once V Bar becomes a club you'll have to pay a cover charge before entering. Since I'm not much of a clubber we left before 9pm.   ...  ... My party of six showed up to V Bar at 5:30pm to partake in their HH deals.  ...  ... Their HH features half off beers, well cocktails and a small percentage off of their specialty cocktails.  ...  ... The reason I had such a great time at V Bar was that even though we showed up during their happy hour, and even though it was a Saturday evening during Spring break weekend, the place was a ghost town. We drank at V Bar for almost two hours and we pretty much had the place to ourselves. It was awesome.  ...  ... I had quite a few drinks in the almost two hours I was at V Bar. My favorite drink of the evening was their Creamy Coconut Mojito. It was strong but still smooth and sweet. I also really enjoyed their Key Lime Pie Martini, Blueberry Stoli Press and some crazy shots our adorable server brought us. ...  ... Since it was HH the prices were great. The service here was also amazing. Our server was super cute and very friendly. She really helped make our experience at V Bar an enjoyable one.    ...  ... I'll definitely be returning to V Bar the next time I'm in LV. It's a great place to start your evening before a crazy night on the strip
44	5	0	1	1	I love V bar! It's really cool and modern looking, and just one of those small spots in Vegas you stop by, drink and just chill for a little while.  ...  ... If I pass by this place, I would probably go again! The bartenders were also very fast which is a huge plus. I think they also had hookah.
44	4	0	3	1	This place is so cool. After Tao was a huge disappointment to us, we searched for something else. My group and I really wanted to do some hookah, but couldn't really find anything. We finally came across VBar. The place is small, but still really cool. They do bottle service, sitting at the bar or they have 3 tables in the back to smoke at. If you get there early enough you can get a table. The price wasn't to bad, I believe it was $30 for the Hookah.  ...  ... The atmosphere is great. They have a DJ and there's room to dance around if you want to. It does get pretty busy later on. The drinks are really good there too. I had a pineapple vodka, often there is just way to much vodka and it makes the drink horrible, but this had the perfect mix. The bartenders are friendly too.  ...  ... If you looking for a good time and are having a hard time deciding whether or not to go to a club. This is a great starting or ending point. I can't wait to come back here next time we are in Vegas.
44	4	0	0	0	The boy with the amazing smile dancing was one of my favorites! He was awesome! Our waitress was nice and the live DJ was a good touch. Us girls had good cocktails and the boys enjoyed some hookah. Good place to relax.
44	1	0	0	0	Our group of about 20 was asked to leave. We were celebrating our friends weekend wedding and stopped by to have fun and buy some tequila bottles. Unfortunately, the way the bar "management" approached our group was not very friendly and someone in our group felt insulted, someone felt provoked...yada yada, we got kicked out. Had a blast at Cleopatra's Barge at Caesar's instead, THE END.
44	4	1	1	1	V Bar was cool! My friends and I found it wandering around the Venetian/Palazzo. We had wanted to take a break from the hard-core Vegas clubs and decided to just bar/lounge hop around our hotel.  ...  ... Has a good ratio of sitting to standing, comfy little booths and tables. I was a bit confused on if people actually ever dance or just kind of sit and bop around haha. They were playing good music and there was a decent amount of open space but no one was really making any moves to dance. It's a pretty small venue but I think it serves its purpose of just being a fun place to drink and hang out pretty well.  ...  ... We didn't get anything to drink, just kind of hung out and talked for like 15 minutes.  ...  ... As we were leaving to check out the Act Nightclub and wander around, one of the bouncers/promoters promised us a bottle of champagne if we came back at like 11:30. We didn't make it back so I'll never know if we actually would've gotten it, but it was a pretty awesome offer nonetheless.
44	4	0	0	0	V Bar was our second stop as part of the Las Vegas Club Crawl. You'll find it in the Venetian and I can say that I love it. I do - it's got everything that I like in a bar/lounge..... Dim lights (sucker for 'em!), bar that overlooks comfy couches and tables that make up the seating area, a good ratio of seating to standing area, music that stills allows you to have a conversation w/ your mates or your date without ripping  apart your vocal cords and a smart/chic dress code.  ...  ... V Bar actually reminds me The Brunswick Social in Brisbane but with dimmer lights and minus the food!  ...  ... I think they've got happy hour from 5 PM to 8 PM, which is pretty cool. I like it, I like it a lot!
44	5	0	0	0	Vbar was an amazing find for us, we love to smoke hookah everyday and found the spot on yelp. as we wandered the strip we made our way to the Vbar and boy were we glad, hookah, STRONG dranks, good music with DJ & a hot host at the front door PAUL (great eye candy for a girls trip #HOTTERthenPherrell lol) we enjoyed the place so much, our second day we went to XS and didn't like it so we headed back to VBAR and chilled the rest of the night.  ...  ... Went in jeans and a tank friday night and straight dolled up saturday night. both were acceptable. located on the casino floor of the Venetian. Small intimate area with some dancing & booths for smoking and chillin with friends/making new friends.
44	5	0	3	1	On Sunday nights, as I've learned, many of the exclusive clubs in Vegas are closed. This led to a lot of wandering around, and girls with sore heels. Luckily, just as we were about to give up, we passed in front of this inconspicuous entrance with a giant V. We were sure the cover was going to be pricy. However, when we asked at the front desk, they asked whether we wanted bottle service ($200...reasonable) vs. just going to the bar.  ...  ... We started at the bar, but the cocktail waitress gave us a big table despite us not getting a bottle! Service was A++. The drink menu had delightful mojitos, orange cream martinis, among other items.  ...  ... Probably one of the BEST drinks I've ever had was their Key Lime Pie Martini. I had two in a row, which I almost never do with food or drinks. The pie crust was sprinkled around the rim of the cup. If you crave a drink without having to suffer through the taste of hard liquor, the drinks at this place are for you! ...  ... The decor is spacious and trendy. The couch seating is modern and comfortable. The music is fantastic and danceable, but not so loud as to overwhelm conversation. Within 20 minutes, everyone was up and dancing, with people breaking on the floor, having a good time. Actually, everyone mingled and we were all dancing with each other until the club closed. ...  ... Great find!! May be different during the week, but on the Sunday night we went, it was exactly what we needed. Amazing drinks, good dancing, and social vibe.
44	1	0	0	0	This place sucks. They say they're open til 4am but it's not actually correct. They close at 1am, stop serving alcohol and hookah and service is sucks. So do not come here either for hookah or drinks. Oh, and they won't tell you that they close at 1am either even when you enter at 12:30am. Doesn't even deserve 1 star. Absolute bs
44	2	0	0	0	Very loud hookah bar more than a lounge. You can't really carry on a conversation because the music is very loud. Service is terrible, the drink server was hard to get a hold of cause she walks away as soon as she sets your drink down and the music is so loud she can't hear if you're trying to call her back. Hookah service was really bad, had to ask 3 times for a hookah and once we finally got one, the server never came back to adjust the coals.
44	5	0	0	0	Bartender Stephanie was amazing! She made a round of wonderful Manhattans, then a spicy red pepper, gin, ginger cocktail that was great. She's new and knows her mixology.
44	4	0	0	0	Been here a few times, and every time I loved the experience. I'm a fan of good cocktails and of course good service. With VBAR that was all provided. The service was great, the bartenders were awesome, the cocktail waitresses were sweet and the drinks were AMAZING. I'm not from Vegas, but every time we come here, the same waitress would recognize me and my friend. It was nice having someone there with a welcome back greeting and a big smile. Definitely a spot i'll be going back to in June.
44	1	1	3	0	Terrible service and bait and switch happy hour!  You could not pay me to go back, very rude staff and manger!
44	3	0	0	0	On the way back to our suite to play some bachelorette party games, we were stopped by a host (a promoter?) who offered us a free bottle of champagne and table service. We didn't want to be rude, so... ...  ... The service was great and the hostesses were very attentive to the guests. It was a little bit quiet when we first arrived at about 10:30pm but it quickly got busy. The crowd was a bit on the older side than most other bars/clubs I've been to on the Strip. We didn't stay for very long as it got really crowded really quickly. ...  ... A nice bonus: There is hookah available.
45	2	0	1	0	My husband decided to surprise me with flowers the day before Valentine's Day, so he stopped at McDonald on the way home from the office.  The flower arrangement itself was beautiful, however within two days the flowers started to die.  We contacted the shop and they told us we would need to bring the flowers back in order to replace them (there was no guarantee that they would be replaced) ...  ... In the past we have ordered flowers from Cactus Flowers, a similar situation came about and without any questions asked Cactus Flowers delivered a new arrangement.  We will not be shopping at McDonald again, instead Cactus has our business for life.
45	1	0	1	0	I unfortunately had the same experience as the other reviewer, I bought flowers for my wife and they died within a day or two.  Scary how similar my experience with the staff was.  They were rather rude regarding their poor flower selection and life of their flowers.  I definitely will not do business with them again.  Thomas H and Aurora E posted on the same day right after the "owners" response using very similar language and typing skills; i.e. using caps for a number of words and the poor grammar is the same.  That is a little suspect but I know it happens on yelp.  It's rather sad this company has to stoop to such low levels.  You would think they would just apologize and want to offer good customer service instead of quoting policy over and over.  In the "owners" 357 word response, not a single "sorry" or "we will do better" or "we will make it right" comment.  Nothing but a long winded explanation about what their policy is and why they are like Macy's (ironic that Macy's actually has amazing customer service and would probably be upset knowing this flower shop is comparing their lack of customer service to Macy's).  I think that is very telling about the owner's and staff at this shop. ...  ... I love supporting local business, but not ones that act like you should be thankful for doing business with them, it should be the other way around.
45	5	1	4	3	When I wanted to send an arrangement to a friend at Barrow Neurological Institute, I opted to choose a local florist rather than FTD, and I am so glad I did.  The owner was so incredibly helpful that I will never use another florist.  Let me explain. ...  ... I called the hospital to get my friend's room number.  I asked the representative if my friend could have flowers in her room, to which he replied, "Yes".  At that point I called McDonald and placed the order.  The florist called me later that day saying that the hospital refused delivery since my friend was in ICU, but they would keep checking back, as if she was moved to a recovery room, they could make the delivery. ...  ... They were unable to make the delivery for a week and a half, but the florist kept me up to date every few days.  When my friend was released, the florist called me saying they would re-make the arrangement, since it had to sit for so long.  I asked if they would delivery to my friend's east valley residence, and they did for a very reasonable fee. ...  ... I love these guys.
45	2	0	0	0	Wasn't particularly thrilled with my experience here. Went yesterday, in a rush to pick up a small bear as a gift for a friend's young daughter who was down the road at the Phoenix Children's Hospital. I expected it to be a little busy. It wasn't particularly busy, maybe about ten people all up. Fortunately, I found what I wanted quickly. First problem, there were apparently two "locations" in the store for checkouts, and one of them was very cramped up against the merchandise (enough for no more than two people to stand one behind the other). Not particularly good feng shui. I went to the other, which only had a couple of people in line. A lady looked at me curiously from behind the counter (I hadn't even reached the front, the person in front of me was still being served by someone else) and then took my stuffed bear. She looked at the tag, futzed around for about ten seconds, then leaned back and handed it to me and said "I'm just going to give this back to you..." Then she walked to the far rear area behind the counter and proceeded to ignore me. Talked to someone. Got a sheaf of papers. Walked around. Put down papers. Talked to someone else. I stood there, still in line, and watched her walk around. Then when she asked someone else in the store area if they needed help I realised that she had dropped me. I stopped her and asked her if there was anything that she needed from me and she just told me to wait in line and someone else would attend to me. Fair enough. Then another person leaned out and took my bear (again, bear in mind that I was still "waiting" for the others in front to be done) and laid it on the counter "ready" to be checked out. I waited. Then one person consulted with the other, both with relatively confused looks. I had no idea what was going on. It seemed like none of them had ever worked there before! One person actually offered to take off the tag (with price along with other instructions) then talked to the other to ask if they needed the tag. Turns out that their credit card system was down - figures - and I was asked to sign a printout despite choosing to pay as debit. They then advised me to check and call if there were any problems, which I took to mean that I could be doublecharged or something. Finally, at least twenty-five minutes later I was out of there. I haven't seen that much confusion since bingo night in the stroke ward. Won't be back.
45	1	0	0	0	My husband wanted to surprise me with flowers while I am home on maternity leave, he gave instruction not to ring the door bell, just in case our baby was sleeping..The man who delivered the flowers actually scared the h*ll out of me! I was nursing my baby, therefore could not come to the door and he stood there ringing and knocking on the door for 10 minutes while my dogs were going crazy. I was actually terrified to answer..I had to stop my baby from eating to see who this psycho was...when I finally figured it out after calling my husband ... ..the guy was getting in his car.. as I was opening the door HE had the nerve to roll his eyes and act in annoyance! maybe this company needs to figure out a more beneficial delivery strategy or don't hire psychotic drivers. ..Although HE was "successful" in making his delivery..I will never recommend this company to delivery. .stick to in store pick up...nice flowers and a fussy baby..thanks a lot
45	5	0	0	0	I am surprised at the reviews for this place. I thought it was a lovely family owned and operated business with quick and courteous customer service.  They got together a great bouquet I personally selected.  The store is wonderful to look around and we had a great time picking out something for a birthday.  I thought they were wonderful.  Enjoyed my time here.
45	5	0	0	0	I needed a plan to bring my wife's spirits up. Hmmm I thought maybe flowers?? But it had to be fast so I called the florist and asked them if they could help me? They not only provided fast service. They actually got delivered to her early. Yay!! And the flowers were perfect and super fresh. This is my first time using this florist and I could not be happier. I am  relatively new to Phoenix and I have found the perfect florist for all occasions. ... Thank you for helping me make my wife happy camper!!!
46	4	4	5	4	I generally seem to think of all these -berto's type fast food places to be all the same.  ...  ... But Amando's is soooo good. I've been a hardcore Filiberto's girl since the womb I'm sure, but the lack of one in my 'hood has forced me to start going elsewhere for my breakfast burrito needs.  ...  ... Amando's more than fills the void. I crave their bean & cheese burrito on a nightly basis, I swear--and no extra charge for cheese! (I hate when -bertos does that! oh and no fee for debit card either!) They have great salsa and I think that is what sets their food apart from the others. The salsa verde is awesome, but packs a punch so watch out. ...  ... Other than the slightly awkward location (getting around the light rail and turning out of the lot is kind of annoying) Amando's is cheap, easy, and convenient. If you are in this area and have a craving, don't be afraid to give them a try! They have combos and daily specials with free drinks in a lot of them, and most importantly, 24-hour yummy, greasy Mexican food. Mmmm.
46	4	0	0	0	Sad.. they've started charging a fee for using your debit card, but that hasn't really stopped me from going- now I just take cash!
46	4	0	1	1	This is an above average neighborhood Mexican restaurant in a neighborhood that needs more spicy dives. I love studying at cafes on nearby Central Ave, and this is delightfully on the way.
46	1	0	0	0	When it's 11:30 pm and me so hungry... I need a burrito call. ...  ... Amando's Bros. sounded like it might satisfy my hungriness but this late night burrito call left me with regret. ...  ... The carne asada burrito was COLD. I had both hands wrapped on a cold burrito. It was such a turn off. I also had the carne asada fries that were equally disappointing. It was covered in cheese and the fries tasted like it was fried in lukewarm oil. It was not crispy or crunchy, just stale and old tasting.  ...  ... The next time I am feeling an itch for a burrito late at night... I will have to pass on Amando's Bros. La comida es no bueno.
46	4	0	0	0	UNDER-RATED!!!!! Look, I worked at an award winning mexican restaurant in san diego for 5 years. I am a picky, picky person when it comes to mexican food. Actually, let me tell you that this is my first ever yelp review because I just feel like it needs to happen. That said, the fact that this place is sitting around with 3 stars is quite sad to me. Just appreciate this place for what it is, a hole-in-the-wall taco joint. Yeah, this is no 5 star place people, big surprise. But I'm telling you, they use pretty good product, and it starts with the tortillas. Tortillas are more important that we realize, and this place has great ones. Any good hole-in-the-wall mexican place has a salsa bar and...SURPRISE! they have one here! The meat is not grizzly and thats seemingly a tough enough feat for some of the Mexi food joints in town. Phoenix, if you continue to prefer Filibertos (really? come on people), then I will continue to prefer my short lines at the far superior Amando Bros!!!
46	4	0	0	0	Sorry guys, this place closed :(
46	4	0	0	0	I hope writing a review after just one visit is not proven to be premature. But with that said I was very surprised how good the Carne Asada Burrito I received at Amando's was. The first thing that struck me was how hot and fresh the tortilla was. You can tell they make them fresh as they still have a hint of rough flour on the exterior. The place looks like a low budget fast food joint but on this initial visit I was quite pleased. I will stop there today for lunch and take a friend so look out for the follow-up!
47	5	4	4	5	Don't Forrrrgggeeettt aaabbbooouuuttt it! ...   ... Pros:  ... Close to work ... Great customer service ... Plenty to choose from ... Good fresh food ...  ... Con ... Medium well or well done only ... The burger, fry and drink were over $10.00 ...  ... I had the Char-Broiled 1/2 pound Black Angus burger with American cheese, mayo, lettuce, sliced tomato, pickles, and mustard served on our freshly toasted bun. ...  ... It was just like a burger from the grill in the back yard. It was fresh, meaty and seasoned perfectly. Nice 1/4 inch plus thick patty. The only thing that would be better would be a little pink in the middle still.   ...  ... The frys were thin but not too thin. They had a good flavor to them too.  ...  ... I will be back but might get the burger with kids frys and a drink, that will shave about 2 bucks off the bill.
47	4	1	3	2	So, after a disappointing trip to the Bista deli, which was sadly closed, we ended up at Joey's. ...  ... And it was awesome. Chicago styled food, included Italian beef and dogs, sadly, no deep dish, and no gyros. ...  ... This is a place where you make your order and pick it up, so those expecting waiter service, not here.  ...  ... Their menu is varied, but as I said earlier, I would have loved to have some other Chicago favorites.  ...  ... I had the Italian beef, which can come in several ways, "Wet", "Dry", and "Dipped", all of which correspond to Au Jus application, I'm not going to describe them, its self explanatory. However, if you want to go for the "I'm not going to eat anything else the rest of the day and part of tomorrow" I recommend getting it "Joey's" style, where in a Philly twist, they pour on the molten Cheeze Whiz and Peppers. ...  ... The meat was well seasoned, and the jus made it good and messy. The cheese was probably horrible for my body, but delicious. ...  ... No liquor license yet, but that doesn't bother me so much, but I just know that once they get beer there, I'll be eating lunch there A LOT. ...  ... Fresh fries and the sandwich made for a hearty meal. Come hungry, because for the cost, about 8-10 a person, you get a ton of food. ...  ... The only reason this place doesn't get a 5 is because I've had the same things elsewhere, and they don't have gyros or deep dish. ...  ... But don't let that discourage you, definitely try this place out!
47	4	2	3	2	I tried the hotdog with chili, fry and a sprite. ...  ... It was all good, a little light on the chili but it tasted good.
47	1	0	1	0	I have been eating Chicago Style Food for 25 years and this is not even close to authentic. I visited both of their stores, the new one just opening by my home, and I thought maybe with a second store they got something right. WRONG. The dog was over cooked, the beef was tasteless at best. With the strong Chicago presence in the Valley, I would think this place could find someone who knows how to make a Dog.
47	4	0	1	0	Met friends for lunch.  I'm from the Chicago area and they are fans of Chicago style hot dogs, so it was the ideal setting for us.  Now I've been rather hungry from a good wet Italian Beef and I wasn't disappointed at all.  Both of my friends also enjoyed it with one willing to drive the distance to return again.  One friend had the Italian Beef like me and the other had the Chicago style Polish Sausage.  We're good hardy eaters and we left satisfied with the portions. ...  ... The staff was fun to work with, even the cook coming up to the counter to talk to us before preparing our food.  The environment was Chicago themed, reminding me of the high-lights of home. ...  ... Will I return, sure will, especially when a craving for good wet Italian Beef returns, I will have to try something else on the menu sometime, but the IB is what they are famous for and I can see why.
47	4	2	2	2	lil update.... ...  ... The burgers are fresh, handmade, grilled burgers. Hard to find that these days. YUMMY YUMMY YUMMY
47	4	1	2	2	I get a chili cheese dog from here on occasion - the price is right, and the food is decent enough.  I'll try some of the other fare from here in the future.
47	2	0	0	0	Being a fan of Chicago style food I had to go to Joeys when it opened. I usually go to Lukes which is in Scottsdale and figured this had to be the same. Boy was I wrong.  ...  ... The hot dogs were very small and the chilli dog had cheese that was ice cold and not even melted on it. The hamburger and fries that my family ordered weren't anything to scream about either.  ...  ... I will continue going to Lukes and not Joeys.
47	3	0	0	0	We went here on a recent Friday night.  Originally, we saw this place when we went to Sticklers and put it on the list.  Well, we couldn't decide where we wanted to go and this popped into our head, so away we went.  Walked in and was impressed, this place was very nice looking on the inside, very clean and some nice Chicago memorabilia giving me some good memories of my time there.    ...  ... Ordering - You walk up to the counter and order and then your number is called and you pick it up, so that's easy enough.  The wife and I each got the italian beef sandwich, 'wet' with cheese.  She went w/ mozzarella, while I went with the 'liquid cheddar'.  I got a combo and we shared the fries.   ...  ... A big plus about this place was the drink fountain, they had cherry coke, which is the way to my heart.  Unfortunately, the mix seemed a bit off, though it was still good.  The food came out quickly enough.   My first thought was that I was impressed with the amount of fries you got.  There was definitely more than enough for both my wife and myself.  The sandwiches...well, they were ok.  My main complaint is that the meat seemed especially salty.  The cheese was good and the bread was good too.   ...  ... Overall I give Joey's three stars.  I think we'll be back and I might try a burger or a meatball sandwich.
47	4	3	5	3	Burger update:  ...  ... Still a fresh hunk of beef flame grilled to perfection (almost) with a freshly cup open bun and good crisp toppings. Hit the spot!  ...  ... The lunch buddy had a Italian Beef with "liquid cheese" peppers and au jus on the side. I dunked the fries into the au jus and it was killer. I will have to try the IB next time.
47	4	1	1	1	Cat's out the bag but I'm knocked up. Like some pregnant women, I've become 100% more delightful to be around, especially when I want certain foods. Don't believe me? Come to my house at 11 pm and hear me whine about needing fruit. Anyways, my newest craving is for Chicago-style hot dogs.  ...  ... To be honest, I can't say I've eaten a lot of these style of hot dogs, in fact pre-pregnancy I can't even remember the last time I ate a hot dog. But they are good. They load them up with all the toppings: relish, onions, tomato, mustard, celery salt, and a pickle all on a poppyseed roll. My only complaint is that if you eat in, they wrap it up in foil and it gets a little soggy. The fries and onion rings are awesome, particularly the onion rings. They were crispy, not overly battered, and the perfect size. All I've had here are hot dogs, but my husband has eaten here quite a bit and says the Italian beef sandwiches are good and huge. ...  ... I love these suckers so much that my husband, who is seriously a saint, will buy like 5 at a time and a mess of onion rings to have in the fridge at home. It's disgusting how much I love Joey's. The best part is that for the month of October they are running a special: $0.99 for a Chicago style hot dog. It's like they knew I'd be knocked up and craving these things.
47	4	0	0	0	Today for lunch my buddy asked if I wanted to go to Joey's and I actually thought an Italian Beef sounded good so I went along to try this place out.  After having real Italian Beef from Portillo's in Chicago and their location in California I was hoping for something close.  They were the closest I've had here in Arizona.  You can order it dunked (self explanitory) wet (a ladle full of juice poured over it, or dry (no juice).  I got sweet and hot peppers on mine and got it wet.  Great lunch was a bit pricey though so that's why I don't give them a full 5 stars.  $10 for a sandwich and drink was a bit much IMO.  If you go only get the Italian Beef as the rest of the stuff didn't seem too appealing.
47	4	0	0	0	Standard Vienna Beef Chicago dogs, and Italian beef. The dogs are now price-reduced to $1.99 permanently rather than the price on the menu, according to the sign in the window.  ...  ... Dogs are good, place is nice & clean. Staff is friendly and knowledgeable. ...  ... Onion rings and cheese fries are excellent. Vienna beef dogs. They also have FIRE DOGS, but you wouldn't know it from the menu. I didn't find out until after I ordered. Oh well, definitely next time. ...  ... You can also buy an assortment of Vienna beef condiments, that are almost impossible to find except online (the neon relish, sport peppers, etc.) ...  ... They have a Chicago classic rock radio station (97.1) playing on the audio system, and a nice, well-adjusted Samsung HDTV flat screen (probably 50") in case there is a game on.
47	3	0	0	0	Husband and I tried Joey's on a Friday evening. We both had the Italian Beef, wet, with mozzarella cheese, mine with sweet peppers. It was good...decent...nothing spectacular. The beef was seasoned well and very tender. We ordered them 'wet' because that's what the sign said they recommend, but personally, I am a fan of au jus, so I should have had it dipped. The fries were thin and crispy. Yum. We will be back, but it probably won't become one of our go-to places.
47	4	1	2	1	Whoah. The most authentic Chicago dog in Phoenix. Other places (Luke's, Chicago Hamburger, Al's), can learn a thing or two. First off, the place is spotless. It's nice to eat at a place where the restaurateur understands that keeping his place clean is an important aspect of the customer experience. Nice not to have dusty nasty t-shirts hanging from the walls. The fries here are also better comparable to other valley Chi-dog eateries. They perfectly match. This will now be a required stop along the way for any trip to/from northern AZ. ...  ... The only thing keeping me from giving 5 stars was the beef sandwich. Sorry guys, but my gold standard for thin sliced Italian beef is Portillos (Joey's beef was almost twice as thick, the bread didn't have that toasted flaky feel, and the gravy just didn't do it for me).
47	5	0	2	2	I must be back in Chicago on Clark and lake enjoying a delicious Chicago dog.  Music from 97.1fm in the background adds the finishing touch.  If you lived, visited, want to visit Chicago this is a must
47	2	1	2	1	Went here on Wednesday for lunch. Was excited to try it due to favorable Yelp reviews and I love "Chicago Hotdogs." Sorry to say, I was disappointed. We arrived about 1:00 pm. There was a long line to order that moved very slow. We placed our order of 1 Chicago dog combo, 1 jumbo dog, 1 dipped beef with sweet peppers. We were given number 73. The other members of our party had number 72. We waited patiently while other numbers were called. When they got to number 72 we expected to be next. Not so. Number 75, 76, etc.... were called but not ours. Finally had to go to the counter and ask where our order was. It ended up they lost the order!! They did make our order immediately. The food was average at best. The beef was nothing special very average. My hot dog was cold. There is no way they could have had that hot dog in the water for more than 30 seconds. Fries had no flavor. I would not return to Joey's and I do believe in giving most restaurants at least three tries in all fairness. Things like losing our order sometimes do happen so I will cut them some slack with that but the food just wasn't that good.
47	2	0	0	0	Wow I can't believe how many people think this place is awesome!  I love Vienna hot dogs but that is the only reason this place gets 2 stars is cause they use Vienna beef. The hot dog is never really hot, it seems like it's always sitting in warm water waiting to be ordered. The fries aren't fresh so that gives them no points. They use the crinkle fries. I haven't had anything else there so I can only give you my opinion on the hot dogs. The only thing this has over Luke's is that it's cheaper.
47	3	2	3	2	I've been to Joey's of Chicago a few times over the past year and have finally settled on a 3 star rating. Joey's reminds me of the Movie with Clint Eastwood titled "The Good, The Bad and The Ugly. ...  ... The Good is the $1.99 Hot Dogs, the Chicago Music Station (FM 97.1), the clean restaurant and the open and spacious booths and tables. ...  ... The Bad is how slow the line is when ordering your food. Also, how the cashier doesn't know the specials like when I ordered a double Italian Sausage, which consists of one bun with two italian sausages; instead she charged me for two Italian Sausage Sandwiches instead of one Italian Sausage Sandwich with a $1.99 charge for extra meat (I didn't have breakfast that day). Another time I ordered a to go order  Italian Sausage sandwich with onions, mustard and relish, instead they put on green pepper, mustard and relish. I could go on but I think you get the point. ...   ... The Ugly is when the Laker/Celtic playoff game was on the TV instead of showing the Cubs/WhiteSox game when both teams had no hitters into the 7th inning. I might understand this if Phoenix was in the finals, but this is supposed to be a Chicago place. ...  ... The food is hit or miss, except the Hot Dogs are always good, and contrary to what another Yelper mentioned, the Hot Dogs are fresh.
47	4	2	3	2	Forgive me Yelpers for I have sinned... ...  ... It has been almost a year since my last Joeys update.  ...  ... Today I had the burger...big surprise right. I just cant help the fact that they make em right. Flamed grilled, real meat, fresh produce, and the bun was really good today. I had nothing but the 1/2lb burger and feel satisfied. ...  ... Staff was nice as usual actually a little nicer then usual... ... Place was clean as usual. ... Prices were decent as usual.
47	2	1	6	1	Joeys Joeys Joeys....  ...  ... I brought the fam here to enjoy a nice burger and well I was disappointed.  ...  ... My 2/3lb burger was not the fat thick burger as I once had. It is now 2x 1/3rd patties. Not even close. NO flavor at all.   ... (As an owner pointed out They have always used 2x 1/3rd patties... maybe I was looking for the 1/2lb?) Either way it was a hand parttied and one thick patty not thin ones.  ...  ... The onion rings were boring, the frys were boring, the chicken nuggets were boring, the fish was good and tarter sauce was great.  ...  ... Too much boring and too much money. I think Joeys out grew themselves.
47	3	2	6	2	Joey's had a neat atmosphere, and okay food. ...  ... The ordering process seemed needlessly long considering the few people there, i would hate to see how backed up the line gets when it's super busy. ...  ... The italian beef sandwich is basically a french dip -- don't let any overly gung ho chicagoan try to tell you otherwise.  They recommend 'dipped' where they put the whole sandwhich in the sauce, and it's likely because the bread they use is pretty dry.  I ordered my sauce on the side for dipping, and the bread was falling apart a little bit as i tried to maneuver it into the cup of tasty but watery sauce.   ...  ... Whatever I had as a side was totally unmemorable, and the amount of time I waited for them to slap precooked meat on a presliced roll was not appropriate, considering the customer load at the time. ...  ... 2.75 generously rounded up.

I like to sit where I can look at the west wall which is a huge wallpaper picture of downtown Chi-town. Anyway, these are the kind of dogs that you cock your head to the side when you take a bite and all of the poppy seeds fall off on to the foil...then you dip the dog and bun into the poppy littered foil and take another bite. You know what I am talking about and don't even act like you don't!
47	4	0	0	0	Italian beef is great.  be warned if you get it wet with cheese it's messy!
47	3	0	1	0	It's good, but not great.  The Italian beef is tasty, but hardly unique or memorable.  I actually like the sausage better.  Aside from that, it's just another Phoenix place that thinks putting Chicago/New York/etc. in the name and on the walls makes the food interesting.
47	1	0	2	0	Went with a group from work.  Ordered the special - beef and sausage and soda.  For $10.03 that is all I got, sliced beef, sausage bun and soda.  Apparently you have ask for anything else like peppers or onions.  Sure with the food server would have mentioned it.  Food was hot, but gosh it was plain.
47	4	0	1	1	The specialty at this place is a Italian Beef.  I must say, it was not bad, but I have really had better.   ...  ... What really helped give the extra star are the french frys.  Perfect!  Really, perfect!  Great flavor, crispy but not crunchy, and not greasy.   ...  ... The Chicago dogs also help.  I think they are only like $2 each, and pretty damn good.   ...  ... Definitely worth stoping in if you find yourself in the area.  Just not worth extended travel.
47	3	0	1	0	Over all I liked it.  For a family it is a decent place to go to get a quick meal.  All of us ended up getting hot dogs.  They were decent, but not great.  My kids each had fries which were o.k.  The wife and I split the onion rings.  I've had better.  We got out of there for less than a $20 bill.  I would go back, but it certainly isn't on the top 20.  it is a nice alternative though to other fast food establishments.  Service was quick and friendly.  Summary-decent but plain food with good service.  I would suggest to the young man cleaning tables to pull your pants up.  Really didn't need to know you had blue plaid boxers on-that were more then 1/2 exposed.
47	4	0	1	0	I have never been to chi town and have no idea what a authentic Chicago dog taste like, but if they taste anything like joeys, I'm sold on the city having good Eat. I've had the Chicago style dogs on 9 out of my 10 visits just to get my dawg fix. I tried the 1/3 burger once and enjoyed it, but not enough for me to ever over look the hot dogs. the fries are Yummy. Service can be hit or miss, but I believe it may be from a high turnover in staff. always different face there to greet me. The drink size offered with the combos are a bit small. Kind of annoying to get up for 3 diet refills on a visit.
47	4	1	2	0	So I guess after the baby is born, you'd expect the craving to go away. It hasn't. And now my 1 year old (lord help me I have a freaking 1 year old) loves hot dogs. I know, I know I'm sort of bad mother for letting him eat mystery meat. But it's a Vienna Beef dog and you know what, IT'S DAMN TASTY. I'll be honest, since I've written the original review I've never had anything other than a hot dog. I consider ordering other things but I can't bring myself to do it. Always a Chicago style hot dog (hold the sport peppers) and a side of onion rings. I've had nibbles of my husband's orders (fish, sausage with peppers) but I keep coming back to the hot dogs.  ...  ... I've never experienced any of the other issues people mention and the fact they mention them gives me a sad. I always think the onion rings are crispy and fresh, and ordering is never slow. I've always found them to be incredibly generous with toppings and they are willing to give sides of things freely.  ...  ... This place is honestly one of my favorite guilty pleasures. I've been known to call my husband an a**hole for eating there without me.

47	3	0	1	0	Being from Chicago, I want to love this place.  But it was just okay.... ...  ... I just had a hot dog, which was decent. ...  ... I ordered a bottle of water, got rang up and paid, and then was told that they were out of water bottles.  What?  Who runs out of bottles of water?  Drive down to Wal-mart and buy a few cases!  So instead they offered me a gigantic cup for pop.  Yuck.  I didn't want soda, I wanted water. ...  ... I'm not sure if I'll be rushing back here any time soon.
47	2	0	0	0	Very overpriced, beef is too well done, and you have to pay extra for any toppings you want. They are trying with the liquid cheese and the dipped sandwiches but they just fall way short, waaaaay short.
47	5	1	1	1	firstly, I am not a hot dog eater. I do NOT like hot dogs and I do not eat them often if I do not have to.  ...  ... I went to Chicago in 2010 for the first time, tried a Chicago dog at a well known place and was not exactly "sold" on them.  ...  ... Im driving home a few nights ago, saw this place and thought, I should go try another hot dog (chicago style) and Im craving those "sport" peppers.  ...  ... My husband and I met there and we walked in and it smelled so good in there. We walk up to the counter and I see they have the REAL Vienna Beef Chicago Dogs with Sport peppers and GREEN Relish. Okay, I will take two, just because.  ...  ... We ordered to go and I also bought a jar of the Vienna Beef Sport Peppers to take home.  ...  ... We get home, open the dogs, and I take my first bite! WOWSA!!! AWESOME AWESOME!!! I ate the first one and half of the other, as Igot too full to finish and all I can say is we have been back twice since. I am now a hot dog eater.... Only from Joeys though!  ...  ... Staff is friendly, atmosphere is clean, and prices are reasonable, if not a little to the high side depending on what you order.  ...  ... Warning: Their "Bag of Fries" will serve three people! Its huge!
47	4	0	0	0	Ordered an Italian beef. Supposedly the special at joeys. Much to my dismay they ran out of Italian beef. Judging by the amount of people (no one in the entire restaurant) the lack of beef was due to poor planning. Ordered the grilled chicken but at this point I was already disappointed. The sandwich was fare, nothing special in any way. Bland is the best description. ...  ...  ...  ... 2-4 stars ... Update- I am increasing the rating because of the owner involvement.  I have not revisited this location, but the effort to right a customer complaint is highly regarded in my book,
47	5	0	1	0	This location is just as great as the one on Bell road.  You can find my review here: ...  ... http://www.yelp.com/biz/joeys-of-chicago-glendale#hrid:jg7qlJsy9Nda0P_HQbcByw
47	3	1	2	2	It was an OK hot dog.  This was the first time I had had a Chicago style dog and I wasn't impressed.  My current work schedule will bring me near here at lunch for a while and I may stop by and get a hot dog loaded my way (mustard, onions, dill relish on a regular bun) to see if my impression changes.
47	3	0	1	0	Joey's consistently delivers a pleasant dining experience.  ...  ... The Maxwell Street style Polish Sausage and the Italian Beef  are very good, especially if you add the gardiniera.  The Chicago style hot dogs are truly that.
47	3	0	1	0	Returned to Joey's and tried the Italian Sub. ...  ... It was by far the best Italian sub sandwich I have had in Arizona.  It was reminiscent of Italian sub sandwiches I had while in the Philadelphia area. ...  ... The Maxwell Street polish was also good.  The fries were hot and crisp. ...  ... If you are in the area it would be a pleasant stop for lunch.
47	3	1	2	1	$12.25 + tax for a single 8" sausage?!?!?!?! ... Not again. ... Mural was cool, but with all the sur-charges for everything, I was sure they were going to charge for air if I stayed any longer.
47	3	0	0	0	Pretty good food and prices here. Sometimes wait is a bit longer than expected. Good for a lunch spot.
47	3	0	0	0	Friendly service. ...  ... Ribs were taken from refrigerator and put on grill to reheat. I would have preferred them to be fresher from a BBQ restaurant.  They tasted okay though.  The sauce was spicy as the default sauce, so be prepared for that. I was not, but they were still edible at the spice level. ...  ... The fries were not that great.  Soggy and wilted. ...  ... Prices are pretty high here. I only go when there is one of those Deal Site deals so I can afford it.  I would expect a wider range of pricing, especially for lunch time.
47	2	0	2	0	Service was poor and so was the food.  Hot dogs are pretty simple - it's just animal byproduct in a tube shape.  Yet these people over charge and under deliver.  It is a family run business and it seems as if they are cutting every corner to make ends meet.  In the end they are being penny wise and pound foolish. ...  ... Oh!  And when we voiced our unhappiness to the owner she informed us that she has never heard a bad thing about her restaurant and it must just be us.  Really?  Does she not look at Yelp?  I've seen more than one poor comment on here.
47	4	0	1	0	When I am home sick for Chicago food this is my go-to! The Hot dogs and Beef are the best I have found in the valley. I would have given them 5 stars but they seem to have training issues.
47	3	11	14	13	Joey's is a fun place to stop and grab a Chicago Red Hot, and the prices are really sweet! ...  ... Like most Chicago places here in the Valley, Joey's has quite a bit of visual stuff going on when you enter the store.  Pictures of the Chicago River, etc.  The fake ivy and brick wall (photo) near where you order is a nice nod towards the Cubies.  If you are from the Southside though, you might not like it as much.  Oh, well! ...  ... I also really like the texts (so signup!) offering discounts during football season when the Bears win a game.  Nice!  The only drawback is the location off I-17 and Happy Valley.  It can be a little bit of a schlep from the east valley.  But, the food is good and well worth the trip in our opinion!  So, if you are up at the outlets in Anthem, this might be a stop on the way back.  Hint, hint! ...  ... Enjoy!

47	4	1	2	2	Why have I not stopped here sooner?  This place was great, I ordered the Italian beef per all the great tips on Yelp and that seems what they are famous for.  It lived up to the hype, this location is a good size and very casual with TV inside.  You order like Chipotle and the lunch specials were not to bad (about $10).  I ordered my sandwich with dip on the side with spicey peppers.  Also got the coleslaw to go with it and ate the whole thing.
47	5	1	0	1	Great hot dogs, fries and hot beef sandwiches!  Staff is friendly and eager to please...
47	4	0	2	1	Beef sandwich - Yes!! We loved the fries and rings too! ...  ... Is it pricey? Yes, it is....but, it's a very good sandwich! ...  ... We don't go that often, however I have never had a problem - food is always hot & delicious.
47	3	7	8	7	I really enjoy Joey's selection of the Chicago radio station, The Drive 97.1 FM; they feature classic rock. ...  ... On to the food. The Polish Sausage comes standard with yellow mustard, two sport peppers and grilled onions on a sesame bun. In Chicago we just say "I want a Polish". IMHO, this is the best item on the menu.  ...  ... The Italian Beef can be garnished with roasted green peppers and melted cheese but their version of roasted green peppers falls way short of expectation. They just thinly slice some green bell peppers and steam them. Plus they use way too much oregano and/or salt & pepper in the au jus. If I could fix one thing about Joey's it would be the Italian Beef. ...  ... Their Chicago style hot dogs are decent and worth ordering. I used to not like their Italian sausages because they used to overcook them. But they do a good job with them now. Although they seem to be on the spicy side but definitely worth ordering. Their meatball sandwich is good sans the oregano. They really love their oregano at Joey's. The fries are okay but they do tend to put a lot of salt on them, so say  "easy on the salt Joey!"
47	4	0	2	0	Great place, I've had the hot dogs and the polish sausage, they're both pretty good, but my fave is the polish sausage. ... The food is always hot and fresh, the staff is friendly and the place is always clean. ... Yes, this is on our regular rotation for lunch. Love the music as well!
47	5	0	6	3	Ha!  Joey's of Chicago is a total 5 star place to grab a fantastic Italian beef sandwich!  Despite what you may read in a few of the other reviews this place is a reliable 4 to 5 star experience.   You can count on it!  What the heck! who goes to a Chicago  style restaurant that is known for the hotdogs and Italian beef and orders a hamburger??  (Although I heard their hamburgers are burger-licious too)! ...  ... This place is locally owned by some very nice folks transplanted from the burbs of Chicago.  At least I know one of them is from Schaumburg, grew up there, at least that's what I heard while eavesdropping :-)  Seriously these folks are from Chicago and they know how to cook some great Chicago style hot dogs and some DELISH hot Italian beef!   It good enough to make to folks at Portillo's proud to have some respectable competition!    ...  ... Oh but this not Portillo's, for their Italian beef is a little different but in a good way!  I had their Italian roast beef sandwich with hot peppers covered with melted provolone cheese dry with a side of dip. (Don't call it ausue... Haha, that's what the peeps from Arizona called it.  In Chicago it's simply called dipping sauce :-)  Anyways, my sandwich was DELISH! The folks with me also had the same thing but they had the sandwich dipped and the other got their's wet.  I don't care for soggy bread but they seemed to like it all the same.   ...  ... Hungry for a fantastic italian beef sandwich or a super chicago style hotdog Joey's is a great place! It's almost guaranteed you'll meet some other folks from the Chicago area dinning here.  I'm not from Chicago but I travel there all the time and I know you'll have a 4 to 5 star experience.  I hope to see you there!
47	5	0	2	2	Found this place on Yelp during a business training here in northern phoenix. It was either here or the burger place around the corner. I'm glad I  Picked here. I was greeted upon walking in the door, I got the Chicago dog combo with mozzarella sticks. Whole thing was 6$ great deal for what I got. I love me a good Chicago dog, and this was by far the best I have ever had. Flavorful frank, great fresh bun and fresh veggies with just the right amount of mustard on it. Oh and the mozzarella sticks, exploded with cheese and were incredibly fresh. I am by far satisfied and will be leaving with a smile on my face. You should really check this place out.
47	4	0	0	0	I Really Like this Place. Their Hot Dogs are always good. One of my favorites here is the cheeseburger. It has a very good taste to it. Also Their fries are coded, whick gives them a good flavor.
47	5	0	0	0	Been coming here since they first opened. The best burgers around. Great service. Always a great experience every time I come here.
47	3	0	1	1	Not much of a hot dog person, but this place gots me singing Hey Joey!  Joey's of Chicago has a couple of locations, but I always attend the North Phoenix one for lunch.  The place is decked out on Chicago sports memorbilia.  I love Michael Jordan!  I admire the man and what little boy during the 80's and 90's didn't want to be like Mike? ...  ... I always order the Chicago-Style Hot Dogs here.  When I first ordered it I was a tab bit surprised.  It came with of the fixins' but on top was a pickle!  Needless to say this hot dog was very different, but very good!  Also, topped with peppers, onions, and radishes, this hot dog is well packed and well --- very good ya know!  Served with a side of fries Joey's is a perfect stop for a lunch.  Hot dogs for dinner?  Not in my repertoire!   ...  ... Joey's claim to be authentic Chicago style hot dogs.  I've been to Chicago once in my life but never had a hot dog there.  However, I guess I'll have to take their words for it since I'm such a west coast boy.  Overall, experience at this place is never a lost.  It is what it is and Hey Joey is all fine with me! - Enjoy!
47	3	0	0	0	Felt like I was inconviencing the cashier with my order. She seemed to have an attitude. They are not cheap so I had an isse with that.  the Italian beef was suppose to be wet and it was dry and looked better than it tasted. The hotdog was ehh but the polish sausage was good. Willing to try it again maybe was an off day. Customer service bothered me
47	5	0	1	0	Started a new job in the area - was looking for something good, but not fast food. This place is awesome!!! ...  ... I ordered the Crispy Chicken Salad. It is huge and it was prepped right where I could see. ...  ... The best part of Joeys, to me, today at least, is that they brew China Mist Passion Fruit Iced Tea!!!!!! This makes me disgustingly happy! I wish their drink prices were a bit cheaper. I can go to AJ's and get the same tea but a 24oz for $1.51. At Joey's I paid 1.75 for a 16oz. If it were not for the price of the drink, I would go daily!

47	5	0	0	0	Never had a bad meal..usually get the Italian beef or Chicago red hots...Polish dogs with onions delish....if you catch it on the righr day they have the $1.99 red hot deal. ..today we try their $4.99 cheeseburger. ..very yummy!!
47	3	0	1	1	Took Jr. here the other day for lunch (summer vacation "dad, I'm bored").  This was my first trip to Joey's.   ...  ... I had a 6" Italian beef sandwich; "wet", with Provolone cheese and hot peppers.   I'm not from Chicago; been there a few times, but I am so NOT an expert on Italian Beef sandwich.   I can only say that I liked Joey's version.  My sandwich was hot and very tasty.  The only complaint about it, was that the hot peppers almost overpowered the beef.  I'm thinking next time I'll get the peppers on the side and add them myself.   The sandwich was packed full of moist beef with a good flavor, and was covered w/ a nice big slice of melted provolone. ...  ... My son had a 1/3 pound cheeseburger.  I had to take a "small" bite, since I was going to do a Yelp review ;).  The cheeseburger was fresh off the barbecue grill and had good flavor.  Only complaint (from me) was that it was too well done for my liking. ...  ... We split a side of fries.  They were fresh out of the fryer, and we liked them. ...  ... I wish Yelp would let us give a 1/2 star.  Joey's rated a solid 3 1/2 stars from me.  The staff was friendly and patient while we ordered (you know, the "first timers" thing).  The food took a few minutes, but was fresh and hot when it came.  Another big thing (for me) was that the iced tea was fresh.  There are so many restaurants and convenience stores that offer iced tea, but they don't know how to clean their containers out.  Not so w/ Joey's, tea was fresh and very good (China Mist). ...  ... We left Joey's full and happy.  We will be back again.
48	1	2	4	0	I recently came here for a thermal wrap that I purchased from living social. It was unprofessional from the get-go. When I called  to make an appointment she kept me on the phone for ten minutes explaining how frustrated she was with living social and that the wrap won't do anything-- I needed to purchase a package for 8 sessions to see results. It just got worse when I got there. I arrived a few minutes early to my appointment and was unsure where to check in so I peaked my head into her suite where the appointment was and said, "hello?". She didn't even say 'hi' she just said, "Oh don't come in yet, I'm not ready" and hurriedly shut the door. ...  ... When I was ready to come in she made me undress in front of her stating, "It's ok I've seen lots of bodies, it's like I don't even see them anymore. I've even had whole families in here naked for spray tanning before. It's pretty cool." (What??) I was not properly draped and felt uncomfortable.  ...  ... The wrap consisted of being lightly swiped over with exfoliating gloves, then rubbed (barely touched) with the lotion. She then put a fleece blanket, heated blankets, and some thermal blanket that looked like a space blanket and let me 'bake' and put on Christmas music. ...  ... After about 20 minutes she came back in and took off the blankets and put a cold pack on me to 'cool me off' (I was already freezing from the blankets coming off and this made me feel nauseous) She lifted up the little fleece blanket (the only thing covering me) and fanned me with it, making me feel exposed once again. The only good thing was the five minute massage she gave me at the end. ...  ... Durring all of this  let her cell phone ring not once, not twice, but 5 separate times on loud and answering it as she walked out of the room (apparently she hasn't figured out how to put it on silent?)  ...  ... I purchased one as a gift for a friend as well and was refunded my money because I didn't want to subject anyone I know to that.  She claimed to be an expert at spray tanning, though. Maybe she should just stick to that.
48	1	4	8	3	Worst.  Massage.  Ever. ...  ... I guess I should clarify that a little.  "Worst massage experience ever" is a little more appropriate.  I came to this establishment because I bought a Groupon for a 60-minute massage and optional spray tan.  I was a first time client, which is what these marketing promotions are supposed to attract, right?  Well, rest assured I will never step foot on the premises again.  If you don't want to read the whole review, the take-away keywords are: unprofessional, trashy and appalling.   ...  ... This miserable tale begins with me arriving a few minutes early to the strip mall where this place is located.  The office area appears to have a number of people operating various businesses out of one space with one common waiting room.  Fifteen minutes after the massage was supposed to start, Jan Thompson (owner) came out, apologized for running late and said she would be ready in a moment.   ...  ... After a few minutes, I entered the massage room that doubles as a spray tan application area.  The room was rather trashy, with products and random things shoved in corners and around the perimeter of the room.  The room was right next to the front door so it wasn't very quiet.  Also, the front of the room consisted of store front windows that were somewhat poorly covered both in style and effect.  The room did nothing to lend itself to a relaxing environment.  Had I been paying full price for this massage I would have probably just turned around then but since it was only $39 I figured I'd just go with it.  "How bad could it be?" I foolishly asked myself.  Jan introduced herself, told me that she would be using hot stones during the massage if that was okay and then asked if I had any requests.  I said that I had been to the chiropractor the day before and would like her focus on my lower back and leg muscles.   She said she would be happy to do that and said she would be checking in with me throughout the massage to make sure the pressure was okay.  I said that would be great because I tend to prefer more of a deep tissue massage to which she responded "I have strong hands so I'll make sure to check to make sure it's not too much."  ...  ... The massage began with Jan attempting to strike up some conversation.  Personally, I don't care to talk during a massage with someone I'm not familiar with but, whatever.  She asked which chiropractor I was seeing.  A seemingly innocuous question, right?  I told her my chiropractor's name to which she responded, "Oh, I don't like her.  She soaked my mom dry.  She had her on all this stuff, some sort of powder, and none of it helped her..."  Now, I'm all for sharing personal experiences and reviews (obviously) but I didn't care to hear Jan trash talk my chiropractor and personal friend DURING MY MASSAGE.  I find it incredibly unprofessional for someone to make such comments to a total stranger, especially in this setting.  I responded with a vague, placating comment and tried to just shrug it off in hopes of salvaging this massage.  Unfortunately, there was no salvaging to be had. ...  ... The massage continued adequately with the use of hot stones and some stretching.  Suddenly, I hear some beeps behind me and a whirring sound.  Jan said she was warming up a neck pillow for me to help relax my muscles.  I think this was the first time I've experienced a microwave being used during a massage-but this massage was pretty atypical from the start so I just rolled with it.  And then I began to hear a vibrating noise.  At first I thought I accidentally turned my phone on vibrate instead of silent until I realized it was coming from a table closer to my head.  It was Jan's phone, and it kept vibrating.  There were probably five phone calls worth before she stopped the massage, told me she had a flat tire and needed to check her messages to make sure the towing company wasn't outside.  In shock, I said "okay".  She proceeded to listen to all of her messages, apologized and then continued the massage.  After several minutes, the vibrating began again and after a few more calls she again stopped the massage.  She again apologized and said the towing company was outside and she needed to step away for a few minutes.  I just laid there, in awe of how ridiculous this experience had been so far, and just said "okay". ...  ... After about five minutes Jan came back, apologized again and said that I could come back sometime and she would give me a free 30 minute massage to make up for the interruptions.  The massage had lasted 45 minutes at this point and I was still lying on my back.  My one request was to have my lower back and leg muscles focused on and we hadn't even gotten to that yet.  The remainder of the massage consisted mostly of the use of hot stones and her elbow.  The "strong hands" that Jan mentioned during the opening act of this farce didn't make much of an appearance at all. ...  ... I could go on with some of the other comedic details but I ran out of space.  Keep your free 30 minutes, I won't be back.
48	2	0	1	0	I just had a spray tan yesterday and as usual I have great results! Jan makes you feel extremely comfortable and relaxed during the session!  I love that after 3 hours you can shower, and your tan will continue to darken! ...  ... However, as far as service goes, it is very poor.  Jan is unprofessional with her many phone calls during sessions, as well as comes off "scatter-brained".
48	1	0	2	0	My son purchased a gift certificate for a massage for me back in October. Before Christmas I called her and played phone tag for quite a while. I have never called her and gotten anything except for her voice mail. Finally we scheduled an appointment in mid to late January. On the day of the appointment, she calls and tells me she is cancelling because it is cold outside. We reschedule for early February. I show up for the massage but she never shows. I call her and guess what? Right, no answer. I leave a message. She calls me the next day and tells me I got the appointment wrong, that it was a Tuesday instead of a Wednesday. This is impossible, since I have a meeting every Tuesday evening and wouldn't make another appointment then. I am smelling her pants on fire over the phone. She then tells me to get a refund for the certificate. Luckily my son didn't purchase the certificate directly from her, so I have requested my refund and hope to get it soon. Do I need to say I will never deal with her again? I didn't think so.
49	5	1	1	1	This is a great casual location to enjoy pizza, calzones, pasta, and sandwiches. The walls are full of NYC memorabilia like pictures of Broadway shows and signs from the subway.  ...  ... Service is friendly and attentive. Our waitress kept gladly bringing paper plates for the four year old to draw on and brought out the kid's spaghetti with the meatballs and the sauce on the side per our request.  ...  ... The food is great and the prices are just right. Their claim to fame is that they make their pizza dough with filtered water imported from NYC.
49	3	1	2	2	Great food! The service...well. I called in a to go order and was told it would be 30 min. So I showed up about 25 min later. The pizza was not ready and they told me it would be another 15 min. I don't mind but it would have been nice to know so I would have come later. So I decided to have a beer at the bar. The server was so busy gossiping about a coworkers hair that she stood there with my drink for about 5 min, until I said something. The staff was just more concerned with themselves then any of the customers. Once I finally got the pizza it was awesome like always. Great food but the staff could use a brush up on etiquette.

49	4	0	0	0	Great pizza. The dough they use is excellent. Apparently they alter/filter the water they use to make the dough to resemble that of New York city tap water. The result is great!! Ingredients are fresh, sauce is tasty. Overall, NYPD ranks a top 5 pizza place in the valley in my book. The service for the most part is great. On busy nights, it can be a tad on the slow side, but that goes for any restaurant. I've been to both the Chandler & Scottsdale Rd locations, and love them both. The Scottsdale location I like slightly more, just due to the 2nd story seating. Fun place and great eats.

Other times the three of us go on Wednesday nights as a family (Kids Eat Free Wednesday nights).   ...  ... I can't say anything bad about this restaurant....it is close, cozy, comfortable, and has good food.   It is by far my favorite place to get pizza!  We went last Wednesday night and tried an all meat pizza with pepperoni, sausage, and meatballs...Delish!   I ate the 5 left over pieces for breakfast the next morning - so much for Weight Watchers two days in a row!  The servers are also very friendly and helpful for kids.   In fact, the decoration is kid friendly - the New York & Statue of LIberty Decor have caused my son and I to do internet research and buy books for educational purposes!  Fun stuff!
49	2	0	1	0	We used to order from NYPD quite often, but this place has gone straight downhill in the last few years. ...  ... We called for pick-up tonight and were put on hold. No problem, it's dinnertime and they're busy. Someone comes on the line and asks if we're ordering pickup or delivery. We tell them... and get put on hold again. Okay. ...  ... The guy taking our order seemed totally clueless - probably another new high schooler they hired. He required long pauses between each item of our huge order of 3 dishes and 2 sides. Not terribly difficult, we thought. ...  ... When we arrived, they tried to tell us that the olive oil that goes on their pasta is plain. Um, seriously? I'm paying for plain olive oil on my plain pasta? I can do that myself! I know for a fact they usually season their olive oil, as do ALL decent Italian restaurants. The fact that I had to argue with them about it was ridiculous. We had to ASK for some garlic and seasoning to be mixed in for us. Thanks. ...  ... Next, we specifically ordered garlic CHEESE knots - confirmed two times over the phone - only to arrive home and discover we had plain garlic knots. If we'd known, we would've saved the money and just had the ones that came with the entrees. Most upsetting was the fact that we were, indeed, charged for the CHEESE knots, not the plain ones. How complex IS this? ...  ... Finally, we had to actually request a side of sauce for our cheesecake, when this was never explained over the phone. Funny, since the website menu specifically states the dessert comes with raspberry topping. If there were options, maybe we should have been informed when ordering. If we hadn't caught the mistake, we would've left with... a slice of plain cheesecake. Fantastic. For nearly 5 bucks? I can get two slices for half that at Walmart, strawberry swirl included. ...  ... All this for overpriced, bland food, an enormous wait time, an incompetent staff, and one huge headache. The pizza is good, sure, but the hassle is NOT worth it anymore. If this is how they run the show now, then I'll take my business somewhere tastier and cheaper.
49	5	0	1	0	heaven!!!!  they have gluten free pizza and it is SOOOOOO GOOOOOOOOOOOD.  once they got there delish pizza i have been there 3 time in 2 weeks.  i am in love.  they also hav ethe best ranch in the world!
49	4	0	0	0	Wow this place happens to be one of mine and my husband's favorite places to go eat pizza. The place is always clean and well kept. The service we get is awesome and the food is always fresh when we get it and oh so delicious. If the price was a little lower I would come to this place almost everyday. Would definitely recommend it for families to come and even romantic for a date.
49	4	1	2	1	I have eaten there twice and ordered out a few times. ... When you order out they tell you it will be 30 minutes. Realistically its 40-45. They have always been nice and gave be a free fountain drink while I wait but now I just come a little later. ...  ... The pizza is great, I love it. I always order the Brooklyn and I love the fresh basil on it. ...  ... When I have eaten there I had mixed experiences, the first time was great, the second time the server spent more time complaining about her fellow employees than serving us.  ...  ...  ... I will eat here again and if your in the area I suggest you try it out.
49	4	0	1	0	Wow and wow again. ...  ... Doesn't look like much from the outside, but I wanted to try a different pizza joint today. The place is very clean and has some modern New York decor up, very spacious. I like how they let you order by slice, and add a side salad for a little bit more.  ...  ... 'The Works' pizza slice was amazing. Fresh herbs, pepperoni, large slices of tomato and bell pepper really caught my tastebuds. Dough was crispy and crunchy on the outside, really NY style. Nice portioned side garden salad by the way, I'm surprised I finally got a salad that's not purely composed of ice berg lettuce. The bill was $5.71+Tip. Finally, a good deal around here. The waiter was good too, kudos to him for constantly referring to me as "Honey". ...  ... I'm surprised to say that this is the first pizza place I've ever been to where I don't have to try to 'catch' the soggy pizza slice with my mouth, with pieces of toppings falling everywhere. I actually left NOT feeling greasy and bloated. Based on their pizza alone, I'd like to come back and try their pastas, the Clam Linguine dish sounds delish. ...  ... Everything was good. Thank you NYPD, for not cheaping out on me!

49	4	0	0	0	I've eaten here a few times and love the Pizza. It's tough to find any pizza around here other than the standard chains. If you're sick of Dominos and want something that reminds you of a big city pizza, give NYPD a try.  ...  ...  If you order online, it says an automatic 1 hour wait. Go early, it's only around 30 and your pizza will be old and cold. I've read 45 - 60 minutes in the reviews but I've never waited longer than 30 minutes, ever.  ...  ... Try anything on the Menu. It's all good.
49	5	0	0	0	Went the other night because Oreganos had a wait. Glad we did. ...  ... Jeffery was serving us, and he did an excellent job. We ordered the Upstate Hot Wings and a 14" Brooklyn Family. The wings came 'sloppy' (bathing in hot sauce) which is always a plus for me. I hate wings that come out like they were basted with a brush with hot sauce.  ...  ... The pizza was delicious. I love the fact that the sausage is sliced and looks like pepperoni. And whatever cheese they use, MUAH! Delicious! ...  ... Jeffery probably had 6 tables at once, and he was always attentive. Ran everything perfectly!

50	3	0	0	0	I took some non asian friends to the fast food counter and they were impressed by the selection.  They were also impressed by the live seafood area in the supermarket.  They are not used to seeing everything alive like that.   ... For 2 mains and a rice/chowmein, was around $6 each, for 7 of us, came out to around $42, pretty inexpensive after spending a weekend at the Marriot Camelback Inn. ... Japanese and chinese restaurants in the same shopping center. ... Place was clean and not smelly for an asian grocery store.
50	5	0	0	1	Support the Asian Invasion and shop at this place.  Mad mad props to a great Asian market in an area like this.   ...  ... My family and I always lived in areas where there weren't many Asians around when I was growing up.  We could never find what we needed for our dishes.  Now I live in SF home of all Asian goodness.  This place gives me hope that should I move away from SF that I will be able to find places where little Chinese girls like me can fill my food cravings for dried baby clams, fish balls, sashimi etc. ...  ... This place is also way cleaner than most markets I've seen.  With very reasonable prices.  Great selection of everything you need from produce, meats, dried, and frozen products.  Also has a deli that I swear could be in the heart of Chinatown.   ...  ... Love love and love.  I heart asian supermarkets.
50	5	1	2	2	While visiting the Phoenix area, we checked out their 'Chinatown'. Small as it is, I was surprise to find a 99 Ranch Mkt. Coming from the Bay Area I wasn't at awe with the store; its typical like all other 99 Ranch I've shopped at. ...  ... It received a 5 star because of its location in the Chinese Cultural Center plaza which is cool to explore.
50	4	0	2	2	Vegetarian nirvana. After moving to AZ from the SF Bay area, I was so excited to finally find a Ranch99 market. There, I discovered vegan 'frozen shrimp' (made of some sort of root), mushroom 'meat' and other tasty bits. The shitake mushrooms cost less here than anywhere else in AZ from what I can find.  ...  ... Of course there are rice crackers, fun veggies, and lots and lots of tea.  ...  ... Be aware - huge tanks of live animals,there for the chopping. Its a bit disturbing to the non-meat eaters. Avoid the back wall of the store.
50	5	4	3	4	This delightfully charming grocery is proof that Phoenix is more diverse than it appears at the surface.  99 Ranch Market has inspired me to get off my butt and try something new and daring in the kitchen.  Anyone up to try some of Stevey's experimental egg rolls or sushi? ...  ... It's not for the faint of heart.  So if seeing chopped-up giant catfish heads and eyeballs or hundreds of huge fish swimming in a tank makes you queasy, 99 Ranch Market may not be for you.   ...  ... But if you don't mind feeling like the only non-Asian within 300 yards in hopes of scoring some ingredients (meats, breads, pastries, green tea ice cream, veggies, fresh seafood, rice and noodles) to whip up an incredible feast, by all means run (don't walk) to 99 Ranch Market.
50	3	2	3	3	It was on a whim that we cruised into Ranch 99 Market. After eating at Matt's Big Breakfast, we were on the 153 going home and decided to take a detour after I admitted that I had never been there. ...  ... My boyfriend was born in Taiwan and spent part of his youth in Thailand, so he was eager to introduce me to some of his favorite childhood treats. Plus we both agreed that it would be fun trying to guess what exactly is in a "Bird's Nest Drink," (it's ginseng and gingko enhanced bird spit, apparently) and other poorly translated or exotic offerings. Plus there was the promise of gigantic tanks of live fish and shellfish, including some of the largest clams I have ever seen (seriously, they had necks the size of toddler's arms). ...  ... I didn't have the intention of doing anything other than browsing, but after a while I had to grab a hand basket because the opportunity for trying something new was too much of a temptation for me to deny. With my guide in tow, I scored all sorts of snack foods, including jackfruit, roasted watermelon seeds (they're just like sunflower seeds, and I'm told that monkeys love them), fresh lychee, curious sounding drinks (chrysanthemum, aloe vera pulp, and grass jelly. couldn't find any birds nest), a variety of soups and marinades.  ...  ... Two full bags of food for 12 dollars. Super sweet. ...  ... I think my favorite part of the entire trip was peeking in other people's carts, seeing ingredients I've never used before and wondering just what meals would soon be created from them.
50	4	0	2	1	Very nice to see a Ranch 99 in Phoenix.  The assorted variety of Asian goods is pretty much like every other Ranch 99's I've been to in CA; a little bit smaller than I noticed though (but that's no matter).   ...  ... This place even has an awesome Taiwanese restaurant!  Comparable to the night market stands in Taiwan!  ...  ... Wonderful wonderful.
50	4	1	3	3	I'm so glad that there is at least one Asian grocery store in the valley. Unfortunately they seem to have a hard time keeping some of my favorite items in stock, I wonder if this is a result of some of the import restrictions/delays that have been a result of the recent quality issues with food and toys imported from China. ...  ... I'm half Chinese and spent much of my youth being dragged around Chinatown near L.A. by my grandmother and 6 or 7 aunts. So the 99 Ranch Market brings back memories...some fond...some not quite so. But, at any rate, the prices are great and the selection is good and authentic (when it's in stock). The cashiers could use a little dosing from the friendly fairy, however. Then again, I don't remember many friendly cashiers or clerks at any of the stores I frequented as a kid...so I guess it just makes the experience all the more genuine for me. ...  ... I would recommend going on a weekday, or, if you must go on the weekend, just avoid going around lunchtime. There's a dim sum restaurant in the same shopping center and the parking lot gets pretty jam packed with cars and pedestrians.
50	4	3	3	4	I don't belong here, that's a given. Immediately when I walk in, I feel like there's a bright, shinning light over my head, as if I'm on stage and it's otherwise pitch black. Translation: I don't belong here.  ...  ... I walk the aisles, admire the plethora of things I've never been seen or heard of. I look at the frozen fish and wonder how in the world to prepare such things. I look at the sake aisle and wish I knew which to pick, which one wouldn't soil my taste buds. Sometimes I'm tempted to pick up their fresh slices of sashimi, but I usually pass. I just can't talk myself into it.  ...  ... I walk by the fresh fish, past the butchers and men with their imploring eyes. I feel uncomfortable under their gaze. I can only imagine what they're thinking. That's when I pretend even harder - pretend that I know what I'm doing, instead of wandering the aisles looking at anything from poxy stix to soy sauce.  ...  ... Then I end up in the meat section, dumbstruck. Gizzards. Tongue. Heart. It's like a lab here, animals dissected to entertain my morbid fascination. I tend to get repulsed when I get to the chicken feet.  ...  ... So, I pass through the produce aisle and stutter near the bakery. Here is where I once picked up the most delicious bread I've ever had. It certainly wasn't healthy, but I don't care. I've since gone back looking for another loaf, but have yet to find it fresh on display. I keep hoping, though, that someday we will be re-united -- myself and that delectable bread - otherwise known as "crack in a bag."   ...  ... So, if I'm so uncomfortable, why do I even bother? Because I like trying new things, from teas to bread to meat. I just can't seem to pick up the latter, for fear of self-poisoning. Plus, nothing beats cheap bags of edamame here. Other stores want nearly $4 for a bag. Screw that.  ...  ... I've also tried their milk pearl tea here. It's not bad. It's not something I'd get very often, for I can find better concoctions elsewhere. But, for what it's worth, it's not a bad choice if you're in need of quenching your thirst while you peruse the many aisles of Asian wonderments.
50	3	0	1	2	I'm used to Ranch 99 back in Northern California, and this supermarket wasn't anything spectacular. This is a good place if you want seafood! All of the traffic was around that area. The food from the take-out section didn't look too good. ...  ... The market also has the bakery, peking duck, the flattened 1/2 duck, and roasted chicken.  ...  ... There is also Hong Kong Express to-go food where you can order noodles, dim sum, congee, boba drinks, rice dishes, etc. It's right next to the take-out food.  ...  ... The most interesting part of the supermarket was the selling of Chinese pancakes in front of the store. You can order mini pancakes with either a red bean, coconut, or custard filling. Each pancake is made to order and is $.50 each. I tried both the custard and red bean pancakes and it was pretty good! Cash only payment for the pancakes. You also have to wait awhile for the pancakes since there is a long line.
50	4	0	1	1	This place is wonderful and at a great location, the Chinese cultural center. They have great Asian products, great selection and great prices. ... The products and packaging are beautiful, for the most part. ... It is the best place to go for fresh seafood (a lot of it is still alive!), the prices are very reasonable. If you are looking for that exact something like frogs legs, rattlesnake, sea cucumber, squid flavored chips or kidney flavored tofu, this is the place to go. ... The produce selection is great and very inexpensive. ... The bakery counter has great pastries and other items. ... It is a great place to just experience.
50	4	0	3	3	Fan-freakin'-tastic! ...  ... I have been here many times and it never lets me down.  This place is fantastic for finding ingredients (regular or hard to find) for homemade Asian food.  The prices are much lower than your local supermarket and the selection is out of control.  I went to pick up some sesame oil and some other random items today and I wondered how I would manage to select one out of the 30 or so different brands and varieties they have.  Luckily, I had a friend with me and we managed to logically deduct ourselves into a selection.   ...  ... The bakery is amazing and everything I've had from there is delicious.  The produce section is vast as is just about every section in the store.  I appreciate that they even have English aisle readings on one side for those of us that can't read characters (Chinese, I think).  Today, the smell was pretty stale-fish-like, but I usually don't find it to be like that.  I have also seen (but not tried) their sushi-grade prepackaged fish cuts.  If I were brave enough to try and make my own sushi (which I am definitely not - let's leave that one to the pros...) I would try it. ...  ... This place is crazy busy pretty much all of the time and the parking lot is 100 times worse.  Make use of the secret underground parking garage with a 3 hour limit.  It's always empty so wither people don't know about it (until I let the cat out of the bag just now) or they are gluttons for the punishment that is the craziness of the parking lot. ...  ... It's a great place and even if you don't have anything in particular you need, browse around and take a chance on something with no English on it.  Study the pictures (they are often very helpful) and who knows, you might just find something you love.

52	5	0	0	0	This was a perfect setting for Las Vegas.  The food was wonderful and the service was impecable.  Drinks arrived early as did the appetizers.  The main course needs a side dish, which you will pay extra for.   ...  ... The wine cellar is amazing.  Make sure you stop by and watch the little people crawl up and down the ladder to get your wines. ...  ... The best part...Ask for outdoor seating.  They have a balcony which overlooks Caesar's Palace with outdoor heaters to keep you warm.
52	4	0	0	0	The steak here is good, but not the best in Vegas. No complaints on the drinks and appetizers. You cannot really mess up oysters on half shell or fried calamari. They have a very extensive wine list and a knowledgeable sommelier. Only complaint I have with Boa is their wait staff. They have no idea on what goes where and who ordered what. Very uncoordinated and slow in delivering the entrees. Steak was cold, but still tasty. Don't get their Kobe Steaks. It's not worth it and it's nothing special. It taste like a more buttery rib eye steak. Ruth Chris's is still the best steakhouse in my opinion.
52	4	0	0	0	Background: Hey, I lived in the Iowa for a year and a half with an expense account. I know good beef. The best corn-fed beef on the planet.  ...  ... So where the heck does BOA get it's meat? They had better keep it secret because it's more than good. It's just about the best cut of meat I've ever had. Oh, and defintely some of the most expensive. ...  ... Vegas makes me think "all show, no go." I've had numerous meals here which make me think, "...ok, the food sucked, but the people are so pretty and well-dressed." BOA is definitely an exception. ...  ... Tender. Flavorful. Without fail. Eyebrows will raise. Conversations cease. ...  ... You choose a cut, a rub and a sauce. I had the Kobe flat iron steak with foie gras butter. I also had some of my friend's bone-in ribeye (peppercorn rub) and some bone-in filet (peppercorn rub). ...  ... Sauces? I noticed that most of the table didn't really have much of their sauce. Everyone was just enjoying the meat too much. ...  ... In most cases, all of the guests at my 12 person table declared the meat to be the best steak they could remember. Most of these folks had been to Trotter's and Luger's at least once. ...  ... The sides and salads are definitely good, but who cares. MEAT. ...  ... Ambience - very swanky LA feel. Dark. Pretty people. Oppressively attractive hostess. Even if you hate that stuff, eat here anyway. ...  ... SF Alternatives: the bone-in ribeye at Bob's Steak and Chop House (Omni Hotel).
52	2	0	3	2	Went here on my sister's recommendation, as she adores the Santa Monica Location.  However, even she agreed that this particular place was not up to par. ...  ... In any case, the highlight of the evening was the steak itself.  Cooked as requested, my dry aged NY strip was tasty.  Also, the service was appropriately attentive and friendly.  Outside of that though...little was going right that evening. ...  ... The first issue came up when I scanned the menu.  Cool, you get to choose from a variety of steaks, from traditional corn-fed to "organic" to , uh oh, Kobe.  Intrigued by the organic offering, I kindly ask our waiter if he could tell me about where they get their organic meat, and if he could tell me if it's partially or completely grass fed.  After hemming and hawing for a bit, he says, 'actually, I don't know...let me go check.'  After a couple of minutes, he comes back and tells me that he's unable to find further information about the organic beef, and how it's raised. ...  ... Red flag on the play, 10 yard penalty, still first down.  Sounds like there's more marketing on the menu than actual care put into the beef.  Suddenly, the Kobe and Organic offerings don't appeal to me anymore. If they don't care enough to know the origins of their specialty meats, how can I possibly expect them to cook them properly?   To give them the benefit of the doubt, I went with a traditional corn-fed steak-- A good move, as I mentioned earlier. ...  ... It comes with a selection of sauces, and I decided to go with Bernaise...as it's always a favorite accompaniment of mine.  To start with I ordered up the Steak Tartare prepared tableside...I was in a beefy mood, what can I say? ...  ... The tartare came, and it wasn't anything special.  They included a quail egg, which is no big foul, but I've always preferred a good amount of yolk to accompany my chopped beef.  Also, it was doused with olive oil and set on top of bitter greens, and served with toasted baguette.  In the end, the preparation masked the pure beefyness that is the only reason for ordering tartare in the first place.  I still long to find the yummy baseballs of fillet and yolk that I'd get in most any Parisian Bistro. ...  ... On to the NY Strip.  Got it with a side of asparagus....limp and stringy, someone forgot to peel the bottoms.  Got to the Bernaise...but it was just way too buttery and missing the balance of a good Bernaise.  I guess they really must be afraid of egg yolk in this joint.  As a backup I tried their J-1 sauce...hmm, it's just like A-1 except not a sweet.  Okay, never mind then, I'll just skip the sauce and go for the meat. ...  ... In the end, the faux Laguiole steak knife on the table pretty much summed things up.  Most everything looks pretty and sounds good...but there just isn't enough substance and care put into the food or the cooking for me to really enjoy it.
52	4	0	0	0	From tasting my friend's steak...it was very good...flavorful and juicy... a bit more expensive than expected, but it's Vegas, and it's Caesars' Palace.  Beware of the price for the special kobe beef steaks...when we went, it was $16/ounce...minimum of 8 ounces.  My friends ordered a 12 ounce steak, thinking it was $6/ounce instead of $16...  but the wait staff was very good and polite about changing the order as soon as we realized.  I thought the service was excellent...they were attentive and not snooty at all.   ...  ... I ordered fish that night...because I was full from eating at the Bellagio buffet just hours earlier.  I think I ordered the special of the evening which was some halibut-like fish...it was not very memorable, though.  I also ordered a caesars salad.  The waitress made it in front of us and it was huge...tasted pretty good, as well...but how can you really go wrong. ...  ... If you go for a birthday, they have a cool candle/sparkler thing they bring out.  Also, they had a really good lychee drink for girls who like sweet coctails.
52	1	0	0	0	Dollar for dollar, one of the worst meals I have had: ... -Way too many tables for a place that charges as mush as they do ... -I was bumped more times thatn I could count by the wait staff ... -Way too loud ... -I hardly ate a bite, and the staff did not much care ...  ... The best part of the meal was the sparkle fountain that the waiter lit with a propane lighter fit for a giant with a crack problem.
52	5	0	0	0	Went here for my birthday last year.  I know there is a location closer to my place, but I still wanted to try their location in LV anyway.  We got seated promptly near the patio.  It was February and it was too cold to eat in the patio even if it had a better view of the strip and the Bellagio fountains.  Their service was very good.  We ordered steaks, salmon on planks and for me the spoiled bday girl that I was got the large lobster.  Our server even took my lobster out of the shell for me and was constantly ensuring that everything was okay at our table.  My cousin's bf was trippin everytime his napkin was getting folded whenever he got up to check out the views or go to the restroom.  I even recall one of their employees rushing to get to the door to open the restroom door for me.  Wow.  Awesome customer service aside from the good food.
52	4	0	0	0	All the way on the third floor of the new Ceasers Palace, is BOA steakhouse. This is yet another steakhouse transplanted from a tiny original version situated on Sunset Blvd at the Grafton Hotel. This restaurant in LA is such a hot spot, well it used to be anyway.  ... The decor of the LA store is super fab, intimate, and dark. BOA in Las Vegas attempts to capture the LA store but it is far larger and more open. I do like the food here though. Steaks come out hot in skillets almost and they can be carved for you table side. Sides are inventive, as many new steakhouses are now days. I will say, the view here is cool, and they have a fun patio that looks out to the strip.  ... The place is really far out of the way, I would recommend valet parking at the forum shops from the strip entrance and going up the elevator, but the walk out to the casino is for real fifteen minutes, don't wear your jimmy choo's.
52	4	0	0	2	We had a great meal here, from the starters to the steaks to the fabulous wine. I had a special starter, a lobster gnocchi that was wonderful, and then moved on to the blue cheese crusted bone-in ribeye, which had a lot of flavor. I also got to try a couple of other starters - the escargot was wonderful and I liked the fried calamari and artichoke. We got a ton of sides - the mushrooms and fries were good but the creamed spinach was delicious. The waiter was super helpful picking out our wine and we really really loved the one we got. Nice view of the Bellagio fountains during dinner!
52	4	0	0	1	Good steaks, nice location at the Ceasar's Forum.  Can be pricy.
52	5	0	0	0	Quite possibly the best steakhouse in Las Vegas, maybe one of the best in the country! ... If I was on Death Row, and granted one final meal, this would be my choice.  (Although there's no way taxpayers would pick up a bill of this size.) ... I think that their Ceasar salad is the best I've had in my entire life.  They make it right next to your table, which is fun to watch. ... The steaks are grilled to perfection.  Go for the Kansas City bone-in Filet Mignon, cooked Rare.  Maybe try the herb butter rub.  It is phenomenal! ... You gotta just splurge sometimes, not worry about prices, and go for the best food you will ever have.
52	5	0	0	0	Introduction: ...  ... Took my parents here for dinner one night during our stay for their 30th wedding anniversary, we had a party of 4.  I put my better half in charge of finding a good steak place and she came to settle on BOA based on other reviews, etc.  We had dinner on a Wednesday night and the place was fairly empty.  The service from the hostess was prompt and they allowed us to basically pick where we wanted to sit.  The decor is nice and the place has a generally good vibe.  Not a typical "mens club" steakhouse feel but a very upbeat which one would argue is typical of Las Vegas. ...  ... Appetizers: ...  ... 1 Bottle of Pinot Noir - I do not recall exactly which bottle but it was very nice and reasonably priced. ...  ... Chilled Jumbo Prawns - Large, fresh and excellent.  They couldnt have been done any better. ...  ... Calamari - Again, fresh and done just right.  Not the rubbery mess that you can sometimes get but very well done fresh calamari. ...  ... Jumbo Lump Crab Cake - Spot on, lots of crab and very tasty. ...  ... Organic Baby Greens - Fresh greens and the balsamic dressing was done right. ...  ... Dinner: ...  ... Jumbo Prawns - A little hesitant to order these after already having shrimp for an appetizer but she wasnt disappointed.  Good flavor, grilled perfectly, not dried out which can typically happen at lesser restaurants. ...  ... 40 Day Dry Aged NY Strip - Wow.  Stop the bus.  Hold the presses.  Being from Kansas and a total meat lover I have eaten countless steaks at some of the best steakhouses in the country, not to mention farm fresh steak from locally grown cattle in Kansas.  The steak here was done to perfection!  This is easily in the top 5 steaks of all time.  If you come for nothing else than a steak, just do it! ...  ... Sides: ...  ... For sides we did family style with mashed potatoes, baked potato and two orders of sauteed mushrooms.  All of these where done correctly.  I really enjoyed the sauteed mushrooms ...  ... Dessert: ...  ... For desert we had a selection of sorbet, cake (I forget exactly which), coffee and tea.  Again the expectations were totally met and everything was delicious. ...  ... Summary: ...  ... The service, the food and the ambiance was done to perfection.  I would go back there in a heartbeat and recommend this restaurant highly to anyone go to Las Vegas that enjoys an excellent steak.
52	4	0	2	1	This place is definitely sexy.  ...  ... The steak tartare is a definite must try and is a prepared tableside with a quail egg. My girlfriend and cousin were a little apprehensive about eating raw meat but then I told them that I use to eat raw ground beef when I was 10 and I'm still alive so it raw meat can't be that bad.  ...  ... if you like martini's their "rain water" drink is a must try.  ...  ... The bone in ribeye definitely melted but it lacked that meaty robust flavor I was looking for. I would suggest going for the kobe flat iron instead.
52	4	0	0	0	I've been to BOA twice during my trips to Vegas for birthdays and was not disappointed when I went. The service is great and the staff is very friendly. Quick refills on water when you have a near empty glass, which is always good in my book. On both trips I have sat outside to look at the view of Vegas and let me say, it is a great view. You might feel the weather though as I was sweating during the summer and near freezing in October. ...  ... Now on to the important part, the food. ... I have tasted most of the appetizers and my favorites seem to be the crab cakes and fried calamari. I enjoyed my lobster bisque and tuna carpaccio.  ...  ... My first time eating there, I order the surf and turf special. The dish was good, but my beef did feel a little more tougher then I thought it would be. It did however, pack a lot of flavor.  ...  ... The second time around was the porterhouse. Let me tell you, this thing is huge. It comes with roasted garlic to spread on the beef and is just so tender and juicy. I would recommend this dish to anybody who is going to try this place out. ...  ... If it is anybodies birthday, they bring out a creme brulee with a small fireworks display. It's really neat. ...  ... If you are looking for a good steak in Vegas, BOA would be a good choice.
52	3	1	0	0	This place really deserves two stars...but the service, atmosphere, and most importantly the view got it an extra one.  Plus Nicholas Cage was there so it gave us somebody to make fun of the whole night ...  ... Started with the Steak Tartare just because my buddies and I had never tried it before and eating raw meat and egg seemed a little adventurous.  It turned out to be the best part of our meal.  Give it a try, you will thank me later ...  ... 3 of the 4 of us were rather disappointed in our steaks.  In a town like Vegas where good steaks are a dime a dozen, these ones really weren't that great for $40+ pieces of meat.  I am pretty bad at bbq'ing steaks and I have done better than the one I got here.  If you want a great steak in Vegas, this doesn't seem like the spot ...  ... The waiter also said the sides were served family style--Apparently that meant there is enough for one person in a tiny bowl that they set in the middle of the table.  Weak!  Desert was good, but its still sad that all four of us said the highlight of our meal was an appetizer we split four ways. ...  ... I will likely give it another chance someday, but not anytime soon.  If you do go there, make sure and reserve a table by the window or outside.  Amazing view of the strip and can watch the Bellagio fountain show.
52	3	0	0	0	BOA is good, but definitely not great. A definite must-try are the nachos. Get ready to shell out some major cash and be a little disappointed. Service is impeccable, however.
52	5	0	0	0	I loved this place.  We were in town for a few days and decided to go to a nice dinner before we went to see a show.  BOA was fantastic.   ...  ... The decor was beautiful and the staff was outstanding.  Our waiters helper dude recommended the best drinks to start with.  I got the BOA 405, it's delicious.  My boyfriend got the gold something.  It was very good, but very strong.  To start we got the Caesar salad. They prepare it table-side.  It was good, not the best ever, but very good.  For dinner I got the petite filet.  I get filet at every steak house I go to and this one was outstanding.  Cooked to perfection and just delicious.  Bob got porterhouse and he loved it.  We split a side dish, we got the smoked cheddar and bacon mashed potatoes.  Oh those were just the most tasty thing.  I was full but I didn't want the waiter to take the plate away because it was so good.  We had no room for dessert.  I wish we would have because I'm sure it would have been great.   ...  ... I know there are lots of great places in Vegas, but when we come back I would not be surprised if we came back here again.
52	4	0	0	0	Ok...this place is killer. One would think because its in a "mall" that it cant be good.  The mall its in is the Forum Shops at Ceasars so its no ordinary mall. ...  ... Anyway, i have eaten here about 5 times in the last year (2007).  Most meals have been with clients and groups from 3-12.  Evey time we have eaten here, we find the decor, atmosphere, menu, food, and service excellent until sometime around desert.  At that point, i dont know if they have a policy to start blowing you off, or if they really are trying to make it all euro and give you your time.  All i know is that it pisses me, and some of my more impatient friends off and it has happened consistently all 5 times we have gone. ...  ... Is that disappearing act enough to keep me from coming back?  obviously not.  The place just needs to get some of their service issues worked out and it will be a perfect 10. ...  ... WBV
52	3	0	0	0	Well I came to yelp for help before booking my Christmas dinner this year in Vegas.  Maybe it was because it was Christmas but I was severely underwhelmed by this place.  The decor is very nice, very trendy chic but personally I prefer my steakhouses a bit more cozy.  There are some booths in the middle of the restaurant but the tables around the edges of the rooms aren't big enough for the plates. ... We had: ...  ... Caesar salad: Made table side with the dressing made from scratch.  it was ok and a portion big enough for 2 as an appetizer - very garlicky though ... Fois gras something something: meh... served with caramelized apples.  the presentation was pretty but the taste was so so and definitely didn't justify the price tag.   ...  ... Petit filet: good but not that hot when it arrived ... Rib eye: decidedly average, a bit sinewy ... Mashed potatoes: these were good  ... Charred broccoli: good flavor but a bit chewy ... Flan: this was disappointing, it was really dense not light like I was expecting. ...  ... But the bread served before the appetizers was great! hahaha... ...  ... The service was just ok too, the wine waiter didn't seem to be able to recommend anything for my pallet and the best of the bunch was the guy that filled up our water glasses!   ...  ... Generally, this place seemed just a tad too happy with itself.  But I guess that's an easy trap to fall into in Vegas.  Next time I'll go back to Hugo's Cellar, it's worth the trip downtown.
52	4	0	0	0	4 1/2 stars. Why not 5? Because thats how I roll.  ...  ... Ok, so I've eaten at just about every single steak house in NYC and the "best" of each major city in the country. ...  ... Boa is hands down in my top 3 of all time.  ...  ... NY Strip in foie gras butter with pepercorn rub??? Tell me you are lying. I practically ate the marrow off of the bone. Delicious ...  ... Mac n truffled cheese? WHAT? Jesus give me more ...  ... Was it cheap? Hell no, but it was so damn good and the service was impeccable. I'd do it all over again ...  ... Dinner for 3 summary: ... Goat Cheese baklava - if you love filo and love goat cheese, this thing rocks ... Prawn cocktail - the standard pre-steak gorging staple ... A big, bold wonderful napa cab ... 2 NY strips and a petit filet ... sides of creamed spinach, mac n cheese, mashed potatoes, mushrooms ... tea, 1 scotch, 1 whiskey ... total: $330ish with tip ...  ... Angioplasty coming soon
52	4	1	4	1	I would give BOA a 3.75 star rating. ...  ... We waited 30-40 minutes for a table even with reservations.  The hostesses didn't seem to be very apologetic when we asked what was taking so long.  We just waited at the bar and ordered some drinks.  The special drinks there are just ok and overpriced.   ...  ... Once we sat down, everything went smoothly.  We ordered a couple bottles of wine and the following: ...  ... Chilled Jumbo Prawns- good (it's pretty hard to mess this up) ... Goat Cheese Baklava- amazing and unique ... Calamari & Artichoke- very tasty ...  ... Petite Filet Mignon and Lobster Tail- this was a HUGE dinner.  The filet was cooked perfectly and I ordered bernaise on the side.   The lobster tail was enormous (check out the pictures) ... Garlic Mashed Potatoes- YUM ... Sauteed Spinach- perfectly seasoned and cooked ...  ... A great place to go if you have a large group.
52	4	0	0	1	Upon arriving ON TIME for the reservation made two weeks prior, we were told that the only table available was in front and outside of the restaurant, facing stores on the top floor of the mall.  Which I found simply degrading.  I didn't make reservation here so I could be eating with the view of mall shoppers.  We told the hostess we'd wait at the bar for the next table available in the main dining room, to which she begrudgingly replied that the wait could be up to an hour.  The wait was less than 5 minutes.  We were led to our table before even being able to order drinks. ...  ... The experience seemed to have kicked off with a very unappetizing attitude.  Thank goodness, it was saved by 1. Absolutely delicious cocktails; 2. A delightful and gracious waiter who comped us a bottle of red, because "you're here to have fun!"; and 3. Steak, mouth watering, juicy, medium rare petit fillet (for me) rubbed in herbed butter with a side of roasted garlic.   ...  ... We're a group of (on average) 5'5", 120lbs female carnivores.  And we all had the Joey Tribbiani determination to finish every bite in our black cocktail dresses.  So we did, in addition to some tuna tartare, smoked salmon, a side of broccoli, a side of mushrooms, and finally creme brulee to finish off. ...  ... I wish the bitchy hostess was not there so I could give this place 5 stars.  As I thought about telling her off on my way out--- I signed my much-better-than-expected check and decided to let it go.  After all I AM a lady.
52	5	1	5	4	Unbelievable. Even for a vegetarian. Had truffle nachos, horseradish au gratin potatoes. My friend had some kind of steak and loved it. No wait, great service. Unique special cocktails. Free valet parking right out front. Shop high-end stores on your way out (unless you're already broke from the meal). The absolute best!!!
52	4	0	0	0	Ok, TRUFFLE NACHOS. ...  ... I, being a truffle fan, was in overload at the abundance of truffle based items. But...TRUFFLE NACHOS!!!  I have no idea how I have made it this far in life without them.
52	5	1	1	2	I've been here a few times w/ my family..the first time was during NYE and another time was to celebrate my sister's birthday..each time I left feeling extremely satisfied! Even though it is pricey..I think it's safe to say that sometimes it's worth it..because there's no sense in spending at a fancy restaurant when the food is dissapointing!!!  ...  ... From what I remember the last time I came here I ordered the "BLT" salad that has some nice applewood smoked bacon, iceberg lettuce, tomatoes, avocado and a nice creamy bacon dressing..but it's not overbearingly heavy considering it has avocado and bacon..they put just the right amount. ...  ... I also like the surf and turf options...For the surf..lobster and prawns...and for the Turf..kobe beef...or filet mignon...the meat is so nice and so tender...and you have a nice selection of "rubs & crusts" as well as "sauces" to get paired w/ them..I highly reccomend the "bearnaise" sauce..it's soo tasty! Also the selection of sides are really yummy too...the hand-cut crispy fries are ridiculously good and so are the garlic mashed potatoes. ...  ... I also like the location..it's in the new wing of the Forum Shops at Caesar's Palace and has a great view overlooking the Strip..if you make reservations ahead of time you can try and get a nice spot over by the window. I like the chic "modern Japanese style" of the restaurant. It's really cute and inviting..a perfect place to celebrate a special occasion..or if you win some big money in Vegas.
52	4	0	0	0	Hello truffle nachos! I've been looking forward to this appetizer ever since making a reservation at Boa and it didn't disappoint! The "nachos" are actually fried potato chips with melted Gruyere cheese and truffles on top, but it was excellent. Who would've thought that I'd also be raving about their dinner rolls! They are served hot and are light and fluffy...almost like a biscuit. Oh man was it good. The star of the show was their special for the night: filet mignon with a pile of crab and lobster meat on top with a barnaise sauce. The beef and crab/lobster combo was excellent, although the seafood was a little on the rich side. The sides that were ordered (cheddar and bacon mashed potatoes and grilled broccoli) were good, but it didn't blow me away. I couldn't even taste the cheese in the mashed potatoes.  ...  ... The service was in a class by itself. On the way to getting seated, I was practically greeted five times by the restaurant staff. Our server was attentive and knowledgeable about the dishes, even giving me pointers on what not to order with my steak. The water glass was always full and plates were taken away in a timely manner. ...  ... It really should get 4.5 stars. There's just something that didn't put this experience over the top but it was a great experience anyway. I wouldn't mind coming back here if someone else paid. :-)
52	5	0	0	0	I have been to some great steakhouses and this is one of them. The service is terrific. I have never been greated and asked how I was doing more than I was during dinner that night. Our waiter was very knowledgeable, helpful,  and polite. They treated us like kings! I had the powerful but delicious cheese truffle chips...wow. If your a cheese aficionado you have to try those! I also got the 40 day aged NY steak blackened with peppercorn sauce. Fantastic. I like my steak spicy and that it was! The sides were cheese mashed potatoes and blackend broccoli with a hint of lemon juice. Everything was wonderful. Our evening was wonderful and it all started at Boa!
52	4	0	0	0	I love meat, seafood and wine.  This place had them all.  The service was the best I've ever had.  They gave great recommendations considering how wonderful the menu was.  Before I could even ask it, they were doing it.  Their Kobe Rib Eye was not only cooked to perfection, but it melted in my mouth.  I dont care how pricy this place was, every minute was worth it.  I'll definitely be back.
52	5	0	0	0	Exceptional service!  Not to mention the wonderful cocktails and impeccable steak!  The execution of the steak was flawless! Get the donuts.... I'm aware it's not a bakery but the donuts are marvelous!
52	5	0	1	0	This is a shout out to you Grant Kwan. Exceptional service! ...  ... I felt like the most important person in the restaurant. The entire staff makes you feel like a VIP.  ...  ... Started with the Goat Cheese Baklava. Simple, yet rich and flavorful. The table side Caesar was perfectly conjured up by the salad man. The bone-in rib eye can be served with a slew of toppings or sauces. I opted for the herbed butter. It ranks in the top 5 steaks I've ever had. ...  ... The lobster mashed potatoes were forgettable. And not worth the $22 price tag. Stick to the standard selection and you'll be better off. ...  ... Stellar wine list, most bottles costing around 100. So expect to shell out a wad of cash for dinner.
52	5	0	1	0	Awesome, Awesome, Awesome.  Went here for a friends birthday and the service, food and atmosphere was just awesome.  ...  ... We had a party of 20 and they did their best to make sure that we had a great time.  I had some steak and some fish, but that was not the best thing I had.  I ordered the Cesar salad on the recommendation of the food server and it was amazing. They make it fresh there from a recipe that is known to be the original recipe.  I actually was with the manager as he made it for me and I assisted with some of the ingredients.   ...  ... I have to be honest, this was the best salad that I have ever had.  I mean EVER.  The best part was the fact that he actually gave me the recipe as well!  Boooo Yaaaa!
52	5	1	1	1	This five star rating comes from my husband, who won't open a Yelp account. I don't feel qualified to rate this steakhouse because as a vegetarian who only ordered the Chop Chop Salad ($13) sans the salami, it seems illegal to comment on the quality of the food!  ...  ... We had reservations for 8:30 and were sent to the bar for about 30 minutes. I really didn't mind because it stretched out the evening. Plus, I've come to concluded that this is how things work in Vegas. Make a reservation, come on time, and hang at the bar so the restaurant can make more money. That's fine, it's Vegas! Hubby ordered Chamay Ales and it came in a custom Chamay glass, very cool. I got my standard dirty martini. It was good, but the two I had a Tao were better, although smaller. BOA pours some solid drinks. You get your money's worth.  ...  ... We were finally sat at a booth table in the dark, classy dining room.  They immediately brought out rosemary rolls that tasty like little croissants, yum! For appetizers we got the truffle nachos ($13) which were pretty good. I wouldn't get them again, tho. I think my husband would. For dinner he got the 40-day aged strip steak ($42) cooked medium rare with no sauces or rubs - he likes his steaks pure. He said it was amazing, cooked perfectly, generous cut of meat with hardly any fat. He said based on the steak alone this place gets a 5 star. We ordered the truffle macaroni and cheese as a side. De-freakin-licious. ($12). ...  ... Also, the servers were amazing. The hostesses were so nice and chatty. The bartenders are fun to talk to and our waiter was funny. This place knows how to hire them!
52	3	0	1	0	Went there for a bachelor party this past weekend, and I must say, more bad than good.. this may have just been my experience, but I think it's worth getting documented: ...  ... * The service was a mix of ok and bad.  the main waiter was friendly, but too chatty, pushed stuff on us we didn't have any interest in, and tended to talk in too much schtick, not that genuine ... * the drinks waiter was just bad - a few folks had to go through multiple iterations to get it right ... * we sat "downstairs" and out on the terrace.  great views and a really nice night, except that the kitchen and bathrooms are upstairs - meaning to go to the bathroom, you need to take an elevator!  if they mess up your drink, they need to walk up 2 flights of stairs to get it fixed ... * prices were ok, but hey, you're in vegas, if you're looking at the prices, go home :-) ... * the side dishes were quite ordinary, a few folks thought they were worse than that. ... * the bachelor of all people had to send his steak back, it was raw... ouch! ...  ... what was good: ... * the salad was delicious, great and fresh ... * the wine list was impressive and lots of magnums for large parties ... * great location, right in the middle of the strip, inside the Caesar's forum shops ... * the tuna was good, others like the steaks (i didnt get one) ...  ... too many other good places in vegas to eat for to ever return.
52	5	0	0	0	Love this place. Great service, great food, great atmosphere.  Of course, it helps when your friends know the GM and chefs.  Foie gras, truffle nachos and porterhouse stand out most.
52	3	0	0	0	I liked Boa, the atmosphere is nice and the food is solid but I'm not sure I'd race back here again.  No particular reason why... other than it was good but didn't blow me away.    ...  ... Standouts were the seafood, particularly the prawn cocktail appetizer... fat fresh giant prawns... only three of them but boy they were delicious.  It's hard to find really top notch prawns that aren't mushy or weird tasting so that impressed me.   The lobster was similarly good, as were the king crab legs, if a little salty.    My filet was well prepared, too...   but I can get good steak at home so... (shrug)... ...  ... Mashed potatoes were bland... don't bother unless you add extra goodies to them...   but the asparagus was well prepared and I'd be interested to try the goat cheese baklava next time.  Perhaps as a lunchtime treat along with the prawns.   ...  ... My go to cocktail here is definately the strawberry martini with balsamic and cracked pepper.   REALLY nice when strawberries are in season.  Try it.
52	2	0	0	0	dont come here if you want decent steak.  come here if you want snobby steak.  which means small overrated portions of food.  the filet mignon was ok, but what i paid for it, NO WAY.  service was really great though, and the food arrived quickly.  crab cakes were the highlight of the meal.
52	2	0	0	0	Shawn Marion was here dining with his family.  He was cool, gave my buddy a pound and graciously took a pic with him since it was his bachelor party (yes we were one of those groups).   ...  ... Let me just say for the prices, I was expected a LOT more.  Aside from the wagyu beef (more on this later), everything else was typical steakhouse.  But for the price, I expected top tier steakhouse ala Ruth's Chris.  I would say it's a step and a half below RC and better than Outback but not two times better as indicated by the prices.  I got the blackened ribeye which was cooked well but the rub on it tasted like one of those grocery store dry rubs.  Mashed potatoes were bland and boring, asparagus was grilled but unseasoned, mushrooms were ok.   ...  ... The wagyu beef however was awesome.  In this case you get what you pay for (aka $16/oz min order of 6 oz).  But the meat was perfectly cooked and literally melted in your mouth.  My buddy let me have a bite and I love him for it.   ...  ... Our waiter was good enough but the service wasn't spectacular or anything.  The food was rushed out and placed in front of you as if you were at Friday's, i.e. placed hastily on your table without any pride.   ...  ... Dessert was also pedestrian.  Probably won't be coming back.
52	2	0	4	1	We went there this past Saturday night 08/16/2008. We were walking around Caeser's looking for a good steak spot and this just happened to be something we noticed. We were seated pretty quickly by the hostess as there was no one really there at around 8:00 pm. Most people showed up around 9:00 pm or so, I guess in Sin City people just eat later. Well the first knock was the fact that it took them about 5-10 minutes just to have a waiter come by and give us menus. They did give us the wine menu when we first sat down, so i guess if you are a big wine drinker then thats good I guess. ...  ... The server was a middle aged man, handed us the menus and took our drink orders. A little bit later, a younger gentleman stopped by and told us about the specials of the day and so forth. Nothing really impressive, just some expensive Kobe beef they were selling by the ounce.  ...  ... My second knock on this place is that they take forever to refill your drinks, i actually had to remind the waiter that my drink needed to be refilled even though he stopped by our table to see how we were doing.  ...  ... So we ordered the calamari and artichoke appetizer, the porterhouse for me and the kansas city bone in fliet mignon for my GF. The appetizers came out pretty quickly, but why would you name the appetizer calamari and artichoke when there is obviously only one peice of artichoke in the dish? It was nothing sepctacular. i have had better calamari at Sam Woo.  ...  ... So we are enjoying ourselves and waiting for our food, there was a couple who sat down about 15-20 minutes after us and they received their main course. I looked over and thought it was kind of peculiar that even though we had appetizers that they would receive the main course before us. But i let it go, thinking that maybe because of what we ordered it would take a tad bit longer. ...  ... Funny thing is, that about 10 minutes later I see the same young waiter we had come by with an order slip and look at the table next to us, checking the order slip and what was in front of the other table, once that happened I knew they had given our order to the wrong table. I also could guess when i saw that the woman at the other table had a porterhouse in front of her, not saying she cant eat it, just saying that she probably wouldnt order the biggest steak on the menu. ...  ... So we wait and wait and wait. The older waiter comes by and tells us our food is on the way, we say okay thank you. Once again even though he stopped by our table he didnt notice our drinks needed to be refilled.  ...  ... The younger waiter than proceeds to come out with what looked like chips topped with some white cream sauce and says that its on the house. I tell him that i would rather not and proceed to ask him why it is taking so gosh darn long for our food. He says that they messed up the order, i then ask him if the table next to us received our order, he tells me honestly, yes they did. ...  ... Two things that pissed me off, first off, you could have come to me right away and explained the situation instead of making me wait 20-30 minutes before finally letting me know. Second thing, dont give me chips and some stupid sauce and think that i can be bamboozled by this gesture. Ridiculous.  ...  ... So by the time the food comes out, its been about 30-45 minutes since we finished out appetizers. The steaks we had were okay, nothing to write home about. I will say that my porterhouse wasnt the best cut and apparently they have a different interpreation of what medium rare is.  ...  ... A manager came by later and gave us his fake apologies and told us he would take care of it for us. He took off my steak, which i really didnt care about. You would think that if i had decided to come to somewhat of a pricey place that i wouldnt mind paying for what i ate, so for them to take off one steak for us did me nothing. ...  ... All in all, a really bad choice on my part for picking this place. Might have well choose the place downstairs, Joe's or something. Would I recommend this place to someone? No, i wouldnt, steak is average at best, service is laughable.
52	5	0	0	0	I was shocked by the bad reviews. According to my own experience, it's one of the best meals I've ever had.  ...  ... The Cocktail: ... Boa 408: with strawberry puree, balsamic vinegar, and crushed black pepper. I only ordered because it's award winning cocktail, and it sounds interesting. And it turned out to be the BEST COCKTAIL I've ever had. I was expecting something heavier, but it's incredibly light and refreshing. Not too sweet, almost can't taste the alcohol, or the pepper. It's just a perfect balance. ...  ... The appetizer: ... Goat cheese Baklava: this is amazing. I love baklava, and this savory version of it is so simple, packed with flavor, surprisingly interesting texture, and just amazing. It's basically the same texture as the sweet baklava, except that the nut filling is replaced by goat (chevre i think) cheese, with pistachio, crushed black truffle sprinkles, and drizzled with honey. Flaky, creamy/cheesy, crunchy, and sweet....I'm going to try to make it at home. It's divine. ...  ... Curried crab timbale with avocado, cantalupe, and lotus chips. I loved the combination very much, especially the big chunks of crab meat on top. This is probably the least favored dish in the meal only because everything else is so amazing, but it's pretty damned good. ...  ... Entree: ... The seafood special f the night: fish fillet (i forgot the name of the fish) wrap, with prawns and asparagus. This is truly amazing dish, perfectly executed, and harmoniously flavored. The fish itself is seared perfectly so the outside is slightly browned, but the inside just melts in your mouth. The whole combination is just perfect.  ...  ... Dessert: ... Flourless Chocolate Cake with homemade Vanilla Bean Icecream. The cake is luke warm and melt in your mouth, but I thought the vanilla bean icecream is stellar.  ...  ... The service: ... Our waiter is so friendly and personable. Great suggestions, great memorization, and so chill. ... The atmosphere is like a lounge bar, very chic, contemporary, but serves excellent food and drinks.  ...  ... I will totally come back and try the steak next time I visit vegas.
52	4	0	0	0	We hit a steakhouse on every trip, so we have been to a ton. Boa is in the Caesar's Forum shops, so it was really convenient since we were seeing a show at Caesar's. I was nervous about the mixed reviews, but we had a fantastic experience. The decor is very modern, but comfortable. The host staff was very friendly and accommodating when we wanted to have a drink in the bar first. Bar staff was great and the Martini's were perfect. Our waiter was really great and we had excellent service throughout. I was really impressed. The food was outstanding. Goat Cheese Baklava was heaven and the Wedge was one of the best I have ever tasted. Great fresh Blue Cheese hunks. We tried the 40 day aged NY and the Bone in Rib Eye. All cooked perfectly and served hot. The sides were served family style and were very good. Wine service was also very good, and I am picky. Excellent list, but a bit pricey (From 2-3X retail) They did bring good stemware and changed glasses between wines. All in all a really good night. I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars because it was pricey, even by Vegas standards.
52	3	0	0	0	It was very trendy...nice environment!  We ate here when it first opened and I just remembered the environment not really the food-it was forgettable!
52	4	0	0	0	Really loved my tuna tartar, and the organic green salad. Between the two appetizers and an iced tea, that made the PERFECT lunch.
52	4	0	0	0	This place seems very classy, trendy. The menu had a handful of good selections. We had the Table Side Classic Caeser, which the dressing itself and salad were made right at your table. We had the Rib-eye with herbed butter and filet mignon with creamy horseradish. Both came out cooked the way we wanted, perfectly. The dish also came with half a bulb of garlic that has been roasted in the oven so it was super soft and very yummy with the steak and mash potatoes! We also had the mashed sour cream and chives.  ... We also had a drink, I believe it was called BOA 504, it had fresh strawberries, vodka , balsamic vinegar and black pepper! Worth trying!
52	5	0	1	2	Okay, so, my ex and I only picked from a limited menu that day (we were there to support Three Square and the Las Vegas Restaurant Week). . .it also happened to be the day before our 1 year anniversary, so we thought, why not make it our anniversary dinner? ...  ... And so that we did.  We had reservations at 6:30 PM but our breakfast of left over galbi, bulgogi and other Park's Korean BBQ delights couldn't hold us over 'til then, so we made our way over around 6.  I was worried that they couldn't seat us because we were there before our reservation time. . .and the worst part about arriving early to a restaurant while you're ravenous is watching everyone else around you eat.   ...  ... There was nobody there.  By this point I was nervous.  I've had bad experiences with Los Angeles's Restaurant Week, and I was preparing myself for a repeat of disaster.  However, the food was superb. ...  ... Free bread (yay!):  Buttery biscuity bread.  Mmn mmn. . .so flaky, warm and golden brown like a biscuit on the outside and yet it was pillowy-soft on the inside like freshly baked bread.  The added hint of rosemary was divine. ...  ... Calamari appetizer:  Crunchy golden brown rods with creamy buttermilk ranch type dipping sauce and a tart marinara sauce on the side.  This was good but not spectacular a la Scott's Seafood calamari provenciale. ...  ... Truffle Chips: OoooOOooOOOOooOOOOooOOOOooOOOoooooooo (this could go on for a while).  Home made, flash fried, thinly sliced, oval shaped chips with a creamy white cheese sauce and truffle oil.  So simple and yet so utterly wonderful!!  This was my favorite appetizer, and comes second to Scott's calamari. ...  ... Kobe Flank Steak: Tender, juicy, perfectly medium rare and they have this tangy steak sauce that they give you on the side that tastes like A1 but even better. I got the charbroiled broccoli and the creamed spinach as sides, and my bf got the mushrooms and the garlic whipped potatoes.  The sides were good, not great, but at least they weren't salty and inedible like the sides from Alexander's Steakhouse in Cupertino. ...  ... Creme brulee: Instead of custard-like in the middle, it had the texture very similar to flan.  Interesting, my bf liked it. . .though I think I prefer my creme brulees creamy! ...  ... Good thing there are two BOA steakhouses in LA. . .I have to visit it again sometime =)
52	5	3	4	4	If you ARE in Vegas and you do NOT have the prime steak sandwich here for lunch you are cheating yourself of a real experience. Yes, really.  ...  ... I was in Vegas for a bachelor party and I arrived earlier than everyone so I just went to BOA by myself for lunch on Friday. Donald, the bartender, couldn't have been more helpful with the menu or drink suggestions and recommended the steak sandwich which was so good that 4 of us came back for it on Saturday. I never had dinner here but everything my group tried was incredible and next time I come to Vegas I am 100% having dinner at BOA one night.
52	4	0	0	0	My new wife an I decided to go to a "good" steak house on our honey moon before taking in a show. While sarching the Internet I found BOA, the ambiance was just what I was looking for. Loungy yet upscale. I was some what aprehensibe as it was a new restaurant but I figured what the hey we will try it. We arrived about 20min early and were still seated +1, we accidently asked the buss boy for our drinks (LOL) but when our waiter came to our table about twoimuyes later he confirmed our drink order. Every question asked was answered thuroughly and without hesitation.  I ordered the American Kobe, my wife ordered the filet mignon and shrimp, when it came to the sides we hesitated a little and our waiter informed us that each side was more than enough for two and we could share( when you spend $50 on a steak that shouldn't matter but to me that was amazing) our sides were the garlic mashed potatoes and the bamboo steammed veggies. If I was to complain about anything at this restaurant it would be the over cooked veggies but then again almost all restuarants over cook their veggies. All in all if you don't mind spending the money our dinner was about $225 with tip then by all means put BOA steak house at the top of you list. This is comming from a man with two chefs one being his wife and the other being his brother. The Kobe was amazing!!!! The service was stellar and the drinks wow we only needed the one Sri k if we wanted to walk out of their on our own two feet. Lmao "good eats" people.
52	5	0	1	0	OMG the oysters were so so so so so good~! I loved the layout and the decor of BOA~! Ive been to the Santa Monica location and the Vegas location did not disappoint me at all~!
52	3	0	1	1	First thing I noticed was that this place wasn't that big...the setting was kind of intimate, dark, and candlelit.  I noticed that they had an outdoor terrace for dining although the night we went...it was slightly pouring outside.  The menu was typical steakhouse choices: porterhouse ribeye, filet, kobe, sirloin, ny, and a few others.  They had the side dishes like truffle mac&cheese, creamed spinach, mashed spuds, sauteed mushrooms, and so on.  They had an interesting prix-fixe menu wherer they gave you a salad, kobe flat iron steak or ahi tuna, and a vanilla creme brulee.  Since I wanted the ribeye, I passed on that but that seemed to be a nice deal. ...  ... The steaks were decent sized...the meat was soft and fresh.  I asked my steak to be blackened and served with their version of A1 dressing.  It was juicy and delicious and cooked well.  The sides were about average....the truffle mac and cheese had a ton of truffle oil in there...I think it was overkill.   ...  ... The restaurant was nice enough to give us a comp'd dessert to celebrate my friend's promotion at work.  They brought out their donut holes dessert and gave him a liquor filled candle which they torched in front of him and caused all the nearby tables to crane their heads to watch.  Plenty entertaining to say the least... ...  ... The service here was more or less good, the food didn't stand out as much as I thought it should had and it did take about 45 minutes for our food to arrive after ordering.  Would I come back here?  Probably not unless it's a dinner for two romantic date thing.  Total damage: $45 ribeye, $15 glass of wine, $8 side, about $90 total after tax and tip.
52	4	0	0	0	Warning....  vegetarian at at steakhouse!  I don't mind going to a good quality steakhouse because generally they have excellent sides.  And this place proves that point! ...  ... Salads are good, great dressings.  All vegetable side dishes were excellent but the highlight for me was truffle mac n cheese...  yum! ...  ... The other girls loved their steaks.  Also, the desserts are phenomonal.  My favorite, creme brulee! ...  ... Drinks were very good, but I was disappointed a few of the coctails they ran out of so I had to switch mid-meal. ...  ... My only complaint was our waiter.  He had no personality and no sense of humor and was actually annoyed by our questions.  We had a big group of 8 ladies and we saw another big group next to us having fun w/there waiter and wished he would come to our table.
52	5	2	2	2	I loved BOA.  ...  ... I had no idea what I was walking into the night it was too late to dine at Joe's Stone Crab...   ...  ... It was late on a Saturday night in Vegas.  We were hungry and spent way too much time in the car to get to Caesar's from Orleans.  To our pleasant surprise BOA was still serving. ...  ... We were seated promptly and were delighted to put in our food order.  I had the rib eye - medium rare.  Cooked to perfection!   ...  ... (This piece of meat was the beginning of a great things to come me.  To search for the next best steak.)   ...  ... The rib eye was buttery and melted in my mouth.  Since there were about 7 of us, I got to sample many of the sides.  We had the asparagus, sauteed mushrooms, creamed spinach, garlic mashed potatoes and the gratin.  All very good. ...  ... I took my time eating my steak...it was that good!  The topper was the perfectly roasted garlic bulb that accompanied my steak.  SHEER AWESOMENESS! ...  ... The decor was dark, modern and very comfortable and the service was impeccable. What more could you ask for?  ...  ... The BEST of the best by far!
52	3	1	0	0	the decor of this place is by far it's best quality. very nice layout, and with a great view down the strip. if the weather is right, then try to get a patio seat.  ... i wish i could say the food lived up to the ambiance. but it didn't. although the steak tartare was delicious. the steaks that were eaten by myself and friends were disappointing.  ... one more side note about his place is that Nick Cage (his hot wife, and his ridiculous hair plugs ) was seated about 20 yards from us. but he too was probably disappointed by the food, just like were disappointed by ghost rider, and that bangkok dangerous
52	4	0	0	0	After a long day of gambling, drinking, and losing all my money. My friends and I decided we needed to treat ourselves to a nice meal. We only ended going to BOA because it was on their close circuit TV. See people, subliminal messages works.  ... I was pretty intoxicated when I got there so everything on the menu sounded great. I ordered the $45 Porterhouse. I've lost so much at this point, $45 sounded like a good deal. The steak was nicely cooked but once again, it didn't really wow me. What did make me say "wow" was their 2 signature drinks. I do not recall what they were called but one was made with fresh strawberries, vodka (I believe), balsamic vinegar (  ... yes! vinegar!), and crushed peppers to top it off. To my amazement, it tasted like candy. The other drink was a rum based drink with pineapple and some other ingredients i cannot recall. Just ask about the 2 signature drinks and they'll tell you. I'll definitely go back for the drinks. As for the steak, I think I'll pass on a $45 Porterhouse next time. BTW, you can order sushi from Sushi Roku next deal if you wanted.
52	4	0	0	0	Boa...  ...      What can I say? I was in Vegas for New Year's and on NYE (New Year's Eve) a friend called around and got our party a table there. Boa originally set a 6 course prix-fixe dinner for $150+ per person (I can't remember exactly but it was somewhere around there), but luckily he convince them to let our party dine there. The only requirement was that each member of our party had to spend at least $50, which was not difficult at a place like Boa.  ...      To make things a little easier on our waiter our party of 12 people asked for 3 separate checks. My boyfriend and I ended up ordering a Porterhouse steak $45 and Lobster (MP - Market Price=$99) and a side order of asparagus $9 because all entrees are a la carte. When the host first seated our party, the waiter brought a round of complimentary shots for everyone. It was a shot of their famous drink "405" and a raspberry one which was less memorable.  ...      I can't remember what time we had arrived at the restaurant, but our food arrived shortly before the big countdown to the New Year. The steak and lobster looked deceptively delicious on a porcelain plate, but I asked the waiter to keep the food warm while we went to the 2nd floor balcony for the countdown. It was a chilly evening in Vegas with a huge crowd on the streets. Boa supplied the guest with a champagne toast at 12. As everyone kissed and cheered in the cold, the fireworks were going off in the background at Rio and all I can think of is the food. After all that we went back inside to our hot food waiting for us to devour it. The Porterhouse steak was cooked to perfection (Medium) and the portion was big. The lobster was delicious as well, I didn't expect it to be as big as it was. My boyfriend and I are pretty big eaters and once we finished our food we were full, but of course I still wanted to indulge in their dessert. The only dessert available that evening was the Opera cake $16 on their prix-fixe menu. I must say it was definitely not worth the $16. The presentation was breathtaking, but once I cut into the cake and had a bite- I was not impressed. I would not order the Opera cake again.  ...  ... The food was great! The ambiance is really romantic and intimate with the dim lighting and lounge type dinning area where we sat.
52	4	0	2	1	When we used to live in Vegas this was our go to spot when we wanted a steak - the best times were going late at night after the rush and sitting out on the patio with a view of the strip.   ...  ... The food was always what I expected with great and friendly service.
52	3	0	0	0	Dinner was delicious chop chop salad, medium-rare filet mignon (cooked perfectly), medium porterhouse steak (very slightly overcooked), heavenly truffled mac n cheese, creamed spinach (needed salt), and fries (wasnt so special to me).  I'm not sure about their fish and poultry entrees but steak entrees only come with the meat and your choice of rub and/or sauce.  Sides are ordered separately.  The restaurant is dim and very romantic yet good for groups as well.  Service was very good and attentive.  A must try is the BOA 405 cocktail (strawberry cocktail with some type of crushed pepper...forgot what it was but it was awesome)!  Dessert was creme brulee...disappointing as it didnt come out warm but cold.  I think all creme brulee served at restaurants, especially higher end ones should only be served warm.  Overall I enjoyed my meal but with so many other restaurants in Vegas I'll most likely not come back for dinner, but definitely coming back for the 405 cocktail!  3.5 stars.
52	3	5	5	4	I mean, it's in a mall.  How much can you expect, really? ...  ... The drinks are great.  Food 'aint.
52	2	0	0	0	I think it is unfair for me to review a steakhouse - being a vegetarian and all that. I was returning a favor to my colleagues who bravely showed up in Gaylords India (read my other review) - the day before and to accommadate their palate. I found the Goat Cheese Baklava pretty interesting and tasty. A few martinis helped and I ordered a non-menu Pasta with veggies that tasted pretty reasonably ok. Overall, not a bad experience.
52	5	0	1	0	My friends and I planned a trip to vegas during spring break '08 and decided to do dinner and a show. We had several other steakhouse options, but finally made the decision to give BOA a try since none of us had ever been there. The entire staff was very nice and were around to tend to our every need whether we needed more bread or more water. We were served potato chip nachos topped with truffle and melted cheddar while we waited for our food. All of the steaks come with your choice of a rub or a sauce so I had the bone-in ribeye with the herbed butter rub with a side of BOA's signature sauce for an additional $1. My steak was cooked medium and was juicy and tender. A whole roasted garlic is also served with your steak, but it is truly an acquired taste. The mushiness and slightly bitter taste of the roasted garlic may not tickle everyone's pallete, but once you can appreciate the taste it can really compliment your steak. The sides were also delicious. We had the lobster mashed potatoes, sauteed mushrooms, and the truffle mac-n-cheese. We all ordered a different meat from the menu such as the bone-in kansas city filet mignon, petite filet, and the american kobe flat iron and there were no complaints. We were all very impressed with the food and the service. They even gave us a sparkling birthday treat of little donut holes with a side of raspberry sauce for dipping, but...we weren't celebrating anyone's birthday!?  ...  ... My friends and I had a very memorable dining experience at the BOA in Las Vegas thanks to the great food along with the A+ service. I was so impressed that I just had to bring my boyfriend the next time I went back to vegas, which was during Labor Day '08. This time around I started with the smooth and creamy lobster bisque. We both ordered the bone-in ribeye because ribeye is our favorite cut. We also ordered two sides to share. He was very pleased with everything just as I thought he would be. We topped off our dinner with a delightful order of creme brulee garnished with a little candied basket filled with fresh fruits and berries.  ...  ... BOA Steakhouse truly is fine dining at its best. They are hands-down on the top of my list for best steak and service all around.
52	5	0	0	0	BOA was everything an expensive, classy steakhouse on the strip should be.  I dined there over two years ago, so I'm not sure if anything has changed.  They have a great view of the strip and giant, comfortable booths.  The drinks were made perfectly and the service was excellent. ...  ... The steak, of course, is the main attraction, and BOA did not dissapoint.  I had the New York Strip with a peppercorn dry rub cooked medium rare.  It had to be one of the best steaks I have ever had.  My girlfriend had a Filet Mignon that was also delicious and cooked perfectly.  Our sides, wasabi mashed potatoes and an order of mushrooms, were also excellent.  It's an expensive meal, but it's worth it if you're a steak lover.
52	4	0	0	0	Best burger I've ever had! ...  ... I came here for lunch on my last trip to Las Vegas with my friends. I had done some research before I got there and was looking for a nice and reasonable place to have lunch (gotta budget yourself in Vegas!). I saw on their menu that they had a Kobe beef burger and prime beef sandwich. I had to go try it out. ...  ... The Kobe beef burger was melt in your mouth good. And for only $12??? Incredible.  ...  ... The prime beef sandwich was a great preview of what their steaks for dinner could be. Came with a salad with this super tasty dressing. I don't remember what it was but I've never had a dressing like that anywhere else before.  ...  ... Next time I come to Vegas I'm going to save up some money so I can check out their dinner entrees. I'm always down for a good steak. =)  ...  ... But if you're on a budget, this place is great for a nice lunch without emptying your wallet.
52	4	0	1	0	Wow! This was impressive. Absolutely loved the decor, although I think we went there too early. Around 7pm and the place was barely getting going, then again, it is Vegas. We would have gone later but had a show to catch. The food however was fantastic. We had kobe flat iron steaks. They melt in your mouth. Also, the truffle oil macaroni and cheese was to die for. The tableside  ceasar was spicy! Not sure why, but it was still cool to have someone come to your table and make everything by scratch in front of you. Definitely recommend the goat cheese and truffle oil bak lava. Very rich experience.
52	5	1	1	1	Kobe beef rib eye = to die for
52	4	0	0	0	Yummy! Boa was listed as one of the top restaurants on opentable.com and it also earned us 1,000 points for booking so it was the choice restaurant for my birthday dinner. Our reservations were on Saturday at 7pm but we had landed in Vegas that same day and got stuck standing in line buying show tickets. We had to call twice to let the hostess know we were gonna be late. We finally arrived 30 minutes late but they were nice and seated us immediately.  ... The bf ordered the bone-in ribeye medium rare, $45 with their peppercorn sauce on the side.  ... I surfed and turfed it, ordering their petite filet mignon medium plus, $39 with their signature J-1 sauce on the side and alaskan king crab legs, mkt price. The sides we ordered was their sauteed seasonal mushrooms, $9 and smoked cheddar bacon mashed potatoes $8.  ... The food was quite awesome. The bf said his ribeye was very good, but not comparable to Pappa's Bros.  ... My petite filet mignon was juicy, tender and cooked just perfectly. I usually don't like sauce with my steak but their signature J-1 was very yummy and complimented the steak's flavor perfectly.  ... The sides were also very good. The cheddar bacon mashed potatoes were recommended by our server, and a very good choice. Bacon is my fave and this had chunks of it. The sauteed mushrooms were good but nothing special about them.  ... We had decided to skip on dessert because we had a show to catch at 9:30pm but our server was so sweet she brought out their vanilla creme brulee and lit a sparkler for my b-day!! It was awesome. I had always wanted a sparkler for my birthday but never knew where to find them so it was extra special to me. The creme brulee was okay but we've had better. (I love Pappa's Bros. and Grand Lux) All in all, dinner was great. The servers were very attentive, asking us if we had any questions about the menu and making suggestions. Our plates were cleared quickly and drinks refilled promptly. To top it off it was nice they made note that the reservation was for a birthday and treated us to the complimentary dessert. Boa would be a place I would return to next time I'm in Vegas.
52	1	0	1	1	It's shameful when a steakhouse can't make a good burger.  ...  ... Had a kobe burger here on the recommendation of another yelper, Daisy T. What a mistake! ...  ... It's clear that Daisy hasn't had a lot of kobe burgers before, because Boa's burger is as bland and forgettable as it gets. Clearly they use purchased patties...they're too perfectly-shaped to be house-ground. Even the condiments and the bun (usually the most forgotten part of the burger experience) were kind of mediocre.  ...  ... For a great burger, Kobe or otherwise, you're better off at Burger Bar, LBS, In & Out, Fatburger...or if you want one of the best burgers in town, Bradley Ogden.
52	5	2	1	2	AS-GOOD-AS-IT-GETS ...  ... Don't know how anyone can come here and not get a STEAK.. it is a "Steakhouse".... burgers? Bah! If you come here don't waste time with the other details, you go to a steakhouse you get a steak, mine was the 40 day aged New York Strip, $44 (not bad) and it was perfectly cooked, I asked "rare with no sauce or rubs" - perfect. With the cream of asparagus soup with lobster for starters and a side of Truffle Mac and Cheese made this the perfect meal for the night. Also, if there's room, ask to be seated on the patio which overlooks the strip ;) ...  ... The service was very good, though between getting our drinks and ordering he did dissappear for a while, but after that he was all over our table like white on rice.   ...  ... They also have a very extensive wine list from all regions and a decent selection of hard liquors, but it's vegas where doesn't? ...  ... After this I went to Casa Fuente for a cigar with some buddies. Anymore manly than that? A steak and a cigar. ...  ... So take it from me, if you're going to Vegas, you're going to spend money on food, don't go low and get a burger, order a steak and a red wine, if you want a burger go to "The Plaza Diner" and order the Big Daddy Barrick Burger ( 9.5 lbs. of burger ).... http://eatfeats.com/calendar/LasVegas.html ... ...  ... So stop by the Caesar's Palace, go up the circular escalator to the top floor and go to Boa's and enjoy a Porterhouse for me!
52	4	0	1	1	I was able to give this place a try,   I regret, I wasn't able to try an actual steak, not because I didn't want one.. but the server never asked if I wanted an entree!? I thought that was very odd..  He must have been rushed or something? By the time I was done with both appetizers.. I was nearly full..so I decided to let it go..  I'm rating this place 4 stars because the steaks looked good, they even had a foie gras butter rub for the steaks that looked yummy.. I will return to try it sometime. ...  ... The bread rolls was pretty mediocre, and tasted a bit aged.. but the butter was extremely soft and creamy.  ...  ... I ordered 2 appetizers..  Foie Gras ($20), and  the japanese wagyu ($32). ...  ... The wagyu was excellent! It was only 2ozs, but after having a 6oz cut at Stripsteak earlier.. This didn't taste much worse, and and I thought it was a decent deal.  It tasted excellent, and came served as 3 sausage shaped pieces. ...  ... The foie gras wasn't bad, but I've had MUCH better before.  If I had to choose, I would settle for the Wagyu next time. ...  ... For dessert, I ordered the creme brulee ($10), which wasn't on the menu. ... I was very good..a solid 4 out of 5. ...  ... There was a nice view right down the strip facing MGM, Paris, Planet Hollywood.  It's on the 3rd floor at the Caesars forum shops.  A nice walk from the free parking garage.  Overall.. a much better option than a vegas buffet IMO.
52	5	0	0	0	We went to BOA during our honeymoon. We started out the evening by talking to one of the chef's of the evening who made some excellent recommendations. Followed by a visit from Sherman who recommended some things from Sushi Roku's menu since we told our waiter we were big sushi fans. Sherman was extremely helpful and personable, as was everyone we dealt with. Next Brian, the manager of the evening, came over to recommend a Scotch for my husband and let him try a couple to help him make a decision. The food was beyond our expectations on all fronts from the sushi starters to the delightful dessert. We had the Cesaer salad, John Dory, the bone-in filet, chipotle dusted corn, lobster mashed potatoes, and banana cake for dessert.
52	5	0	0	0	Wow the fillet Mignon was delicious!!!  It had to be my top 3 steaks house I've ever been to. It had like this mild spicy sauce to it that gave it an amazing taste.  Good stuff and definitely worth the $$$$$$$
52	4	0	0	0	What can I say? I went here because I wanted fantastic food and great atmosphere and my fellow Yelpers said this would give me both.  But they failed to tell me the service would be great as well!  Plus I made the reservation on Open Table noting that I'd like the balcony seating (per a Yelper) and I received it even though we extended our reservation twice!  Plus they do bday surprises.  LOVE IT.  Everything we ordered was fantastico - - from steaks, crab legs (YUMMY), Oysters to signature strawberry drinks.  But please pass on the three chocholate moose dessert - - get the donuts :) Please go and enjoy yourself!
52	5	0	0	0	This place was great.  I cannot say enough about the great food and service [Thanks Kelly!].  We went while in Vegas on the 4th of July weekend for a friend's birthday and they really made it special...we had a table by the windows that showed the whole strip [we wanted outside, but it was like 95 degrees at 8pm], our server went so far as to go to their sister restaurant [Sushi Roku] because someone in our party wanted sushi instead of steak, and they came out with a blow torch and a roman candle and really made a scene with dessert to celebrate the birthday [ps - get the doughnut balls for dessert!].  It was expensive, however, well worth it for special occasions.  We will DEFINITELY be back whenever we are in town!
52	5	0	0	0	i loved loved loved loved this place!! ...  ... we went to vegas for an anniversary weekend, and i didnt know that my bf made reservations here. usualyl when i go to vegas, i like to hit the buffets and eat till my belly protrudes like a balloon. however, this time i was not feeling so great, maybe from the heat, exhaustion, who knows. but when we went to the buffets, i could barely finish a plate of food.  ... on our second night, my bf took me here for diinner.  ... i started off with a cocktail. i dont rememebr the name, but it had lychee and blueberyr in it..it was YUMM. ... as usual, i ordered my filet, he had the porterhouse. i didnt want to order my own steak because i thought i wouldnt be able to finish it since i wasnt feelign very good, and didnt have much of an appetite. boy was i glad i orderd my own steak.  ...  ... when the steaks came, i noticed a roasted garlic bulb on my plate. i lOVE garlic, so i got excited and started eating my steak with the garlic and straight horseradish. next thing you know, im done. it was soo delicious! ... our server was very kind and offered us all of these different steak sauces from peppercorn sauce to wine reduction, and a bunch more. we tried them all and they were all very good.  ... we had potato gratin and wild mushrooms as our sides. the mushrooms were delicious, but the potatoes were eh~. ... we had creme brulee for dessert and it was really god as well! ...  ... i really recommend this place! it was worth every penny! now i want to try the one in santa monica.
52	4	0	0	0	I went here for my birthday with my friends. it was a big group of people. Place was packed.  ...  ... My gf and I was there along with one other friend before my other friends showed up. We set around the bar/lounge are and my gf had a coke. They said the coke was on the house. =) haha although it was a small thing but it made us felt welcome.  ... After all my friends got there we had a large meal with couple bottle of wine. They gave us dissert on the house for my birthday. Food was good, although they put little too much peppercorn on my peppercorn steak.  ...  ... Service was great even though their waiter must have been busy with all the tables filled up. Waiter also had a sense of humor which made our dining experience even better.  ...  ... I will be back next time I visit Vegas again. I would recommend this place to everyone.
52	3	2	6	4	I have been to the BOA Steakhouse in Santa Monica before.  I gave BOA in Santa Monica 3 stars too because they couldn't cook the meat right, their Wagyu steak was too dry and their sides were too salty but their ambiance is great. (http://www.yelp.com/user_details_review_search?userid=EpAkqFJLjztmlAscrTfh_Q&q=BOA)  ...  ... BOA Steakhouse in Caesar's palace was a complete opposite.  The ambiance was horrible, seating was uncomfortable and the lighting was too strong it nearly blinded us.  Service was pretty laid back for a steakhouse... which I don't mind... but a little more attention wouldn't hurt.... ...  ... But the steaks were cooked PERFECTLY.  It was tasty and juicy... mMmMmMmmm... I ordered a medium rare and the steak was perfectly medium rare from the tip to the middle to the end.  Polish up the interior and with better service, this restaurant could potentially be 5 stars. ...  ... Starter Prawns: It was pretty good: http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/-zDImDk6zHLMdUKAoOb20A/l ...  ... Steakes: YUMMAY!: http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/4UoysCayBg9C8Ld9ppwySA/l

I've never tried escargo before so we added that for our appetizer. For the first course, we had the ceasar salad, asparagas soup and tuna tartar. Out of all these, the best was the Ceasar Salad. It was made fresh by our table side. For the second course my boyfriend had the filet mignon medallions and I had the Salmon. Both of these were cooked to perfection. The steak tasted so good I thought I was in heaven. The cocktails were also very good (if you like girly strong drinks). We did not get to eat the donut holes everyone has been raving about because my bf and his friend didn't feel well (too much partying!) We ended up leaving and the waitress felt so bad we couldn't stay for dessert. She took my cocktail drink off my bill and told us we could come back for it later that night. SERVICE was a 10 as she catered to our needs the whole night. When I didn't eat my soup, she offered to get me a salad or something else...........now this is fine dining. I felt like a Queen. I sure will come back there AND willing to pay full price for it. Well worth the $$$$, every bit of it.
52	5	0	0	0	Went to Boa at the Forum Shops for my boyfriend's birthday dinner during Labor Day Weekend.  ...  ... Being at Caesar's Palace and a steakhouse, I knew it was gonna cost my a pretty penny. DUH!  ...  ... It was lovely (and thank God it wasnt too crowded) and romantic. The waiter (damn forgot his name) was awesome, polite and attentive. My boyfriend ordered the Porterhouse steak with mashed potatoes, which he loved... and I wasnt in the mood for beef so I ordered the Ahi Tuna, which was perfect because Boa owns Sushi Roku or vice versa... The ahi tuna was pretty delicious and scrumptous with a side a mashed potatoes with a touch of wasabi flavoring (?).   ...  ... All in all, great romantic spot with good food, great service and YUMMY Boa 405 cocktail, its a must try!
52	5	0	1	1	I came here for a birthday dinner tonight and this is probably a restaurant I would not have chosen on my own if it was not for the large party birthday dinner. It is in the middle of Ceaser's forum shops, and the decor is very modern and trendy inside. It is not a large restaurant but it is also right next door to Sushi Roku.  ...  ... They start you off with yummmmmy bread, it had rosemary in it, came out fresh and hot and tasted like a lighter focaccia bread. i think I had like 2 and a half rolls because it was so delicious. I then had the Boa Chop Chop salad which I thought was really great. It had chickpeas, cheese, ham, salami, pepporcinis and was very good. Some other people in our party had the ceaser salad and they prepare it tableside which is kind of cool.  ...  ... For entrees my bf and I shared the filet and spaghetti with kobe meatballs. The fillet was not bad but I have had better steak elsewhere, we had a side of Bearnaise sauce, and my favorite part was the roasted garlic half  that came on the side. Some of the sides we had were the truffle mac and cheese (a favorite of the group), potato au gratin were good too.  ...  ... For dessert, the tiramisu was delicious, and I tried the banana bread with toffee sauce. Yumm. I've really got to say this was a great restaurant, the service was good, and we got a 20% locals discount.
52	3	0	0	0	I've since returned to BOA and this time for lunch.  My 3 stars remains the same for now... but I've been able to try a few more dishes so.. time to update. ...  ... As I said, we returned for lunch so the restaurant was far less full and the menu a bit more limited.  You have a choice of several appetizers, soup of the day, about five salads, a burger, a few sandwiches, and a smaller list of entrees.    ...  ... We sat in the front so that we could people watch, which is always fun... and the staff was great... really down to earth, quick on the draw with the cocktails and very fast to remove the charge for a mistake on the order and comp us a round of drinks.   ...  ... We ordered the beef tartare (we thought we ordered tuna but that was a mistake), goat cheese baklava, prawn cocktail and the BLT salad to share.   The staff was very helpful in deciding how much would be enough for 3 girls to share but not spoil their dinner later.  ...  ... I thought the beef tartare left a lot to be desired.  I am usually a fan of the dish and the presentation was pretty (they cracked the egg and mixed it tableside) but I just didn't care for the texture (the meat was not very finely ground) or the flavor (a bit bland). ...  ... I was a fan of the prawns last time but this time around they seemed a bit dried out.  Might skip that next time. ...  ... The goat cheese baklava is a new favorite.  All three of us thought this was a real standout.   The combination of textures and flavors was wonderful..  from the paper thin phyllo and the creamy, tangy cheese, to the drizzle of honey and sprinkle of pistacios, right down to the bit of frisee salad with candied orange peel.  Would definitely like to have this again... and I ain't sharin'.  ;-) ...  ... The salad was also very good.  I can't say that it's more exciting than anything else I've had but I think it's great light lunch fare to grab a salad and the baklava and call it a day. ...  ... Well.. and of course... the famous 405 cocktail has to be on the agenda too.  Still delicious...
52	5	0	0	0	damn.. good beef!  i haven't been here since January, and I still think about it sometimes!!  If I remember right I had filet mignon and it was delicious!  OOo.. and the restaurant itself.. so chic and sexy!  Drinks are great too!
52	4	0	0	0	An outstanding restaurant.  We arrived a bit early and had drinks in the lounge before dinner.  Once seated at our table, the service was excellent and our dinners (surf & turf aka lobster & steak) were all top shelf.  They have an excellent wine collection and their desserts and quite good as well.
52	4	3	3	2	Thanks to wives that can spend endless hours shopping in the Casar's forum shops, I was able to get the full experience of Boa along with a couple of buddies. We finally decided on this steakhouse after a brief conversation with the very friendly hostess who reassured us that our transient like appearance would not be mocked by any of the staff and we would still be served the same quality pieces of meat as more suitably dressed guests. We had to wait for the females so first stop was the bar.  ... The bartender was quite friendly and knowledgeable about mixed drinks and their wine selection. Despite knowing that Boa is well known for their locally created mixed drinks we opted for a bottle of Malbec from their extensive list. When the femaliens finished their shopping expedition, we were immediately seated in their impressive dining room.  ... We were seated in an impressive booth with a decent view of the strip for half of our group...the rest of the group got to look at us looking at the strip. We each ordered a side and decided to share all of them as they all seemed to sound good. Circling the table was:  ... Garlic mashed taters  ... Balsamic string beans with toasted pine nuts  ... Lyonnaise potatos  ... Macaroni and cheese  ... The sides were quite fantastic, the best of all being the mac and cheese and the mashed potatos. Mac and cheese were made with a shell shaped pasta that was perfectly cooked and very thick and doughy...wonderful.  ...  ... As for the steak, I had a bone-in ribeye ordered medium well. It was cooked perfectly and came with a very good peppercorn sauce. Other items that were ordered at our table were the 40day aged New York and the Boa Burger all of which received rave reviews.  ...  ... Service at Boa was impeccable, our waiter seemed to come by at the perfect time, every time and did not have to be asked for anything really. He just knew what we needed a minute before asking for it. I could not have asked for more.  ...  ... So, after reading this....why only 4 stars?  ...  ... It is a steak house...granted they did have a great steak...but a 5 star steak? It is a rare day that this foodie comes across a 5 star steak.
52	4	1	0	1	beautiful place. :)  ...  ... AND apparent favorite of George Clooney! :)i can tell why he liikes this place. first of all, it looks like $$$! lol. it looks really expensive. but thats what makes it a beautiful place sometimes :) ...  ... SO today was one of dads "get whatever you want, dont worry about the money" type days. and we just so HAPPENED to spot BOA's :) ...  ... We go in. Customer service is great. they lead us into our table and give us menus. my waiter even did my napkin for me! haha. it was dark and i LOVE dark restraurants. it just gives off that feel. that hecka subtle dark moody feel. ...  ... theres a sheet of paper that they call a menu that you order from. one sided. i guess it was because we arrived lunchtimeish. but there was plenty that we wanted to eat. so it was good ...   ... i ordered the bone in filet mignon. my sister got the porterhouse. and my dad got the SHOOT I FORGOT! -_- but it was just OK. my bone in filet mignon however was delicious. a bit salty and a bit burnt lol i had a slight charred taste in my mouth for a while haha. but was delicious. perfect red smack in the middle. beautiful. didnt cut as well as texas roadhouse but goooood. it was a good 12 ounce. if you dont know what a 12 ouncer looks like, imagine your fist rolled up. thats what it looks like haha. ...  ...  My sisters porterhouse was 16 ounces. more bigger than my filet mignon but lacked in that much flavor. personally i liked mine MUCH better then hers but she said she liked hers more than mine ,so (shrug) ...  ... my mom and child sister ordered sandwiches. WHICH WERE DELICIOUS. and affordable.  ...  ... steaks were around 20-34 dollars. sandwiches around 14-20. ...  ... OMOMGOMGOMGOGOMG forgot about the bread! you have to ask for it so that they give it to you. but WOW good. like definetly. good. super hot and warm. deliciousss ...  ... hmm.. i guess a couple drawbacks to this otherwise perfect steakhouse would be the wait. and the cost. i honestly didnt think my money was worth it here and the wait was way too long. my dad ordered coffee after dinner and it took well over 20 minutes. -_-
52	4	2	4	3	Awesome steakhouse! ...  ... We came in on our x'mas dinner celebration, got seated by the window that look out to Paris & the Water show at Belagio. ...  ... The waiter took the time answer our question on the menu & offer the different special they didn't have on the menu. ...  ... Services was very good.  Food was just excellent. Highly recommend!
52	3	0	0	0	Very accommodating place as they found a table for the five of us even on a Friday night even without a reservation.   ...  ... So why the 3 stars?  Personally I thought the steak (NY Strip) was only okay and for a $44 steak I was expecting a little more.  My cousin got the lamb chop which he found to be extremely good (though he thought the Wynn buffet lamb chops were a better value).  The bacon and cheddar mash potato was very, very satisfying.   On the other hand, you can probably skip the fries though as it was meh.
52	5	0	5	3	As a local, it takes a lot to get me to the strip just to eat a meal, even if it is at a steakhouse that's supposedly one of the best in Vegas.  We've got tons of them.  But when I heard that Boa was having their 5 year anniversary and were offering 50% off their entire menu, I had to go try it.  Boy am I glad I did. ...  ... From the moment my girlfriend and I walked in, we were treated to fantastic service.  A manager passed us and greeted us, and even though it was odd that we didn't get menus when we sat down, they arrived shortly. ...  ... We started with the fritto misto, which is a calamari and artichoke dish.  My girlfriend loves artichokes, so she was very disappointed when it arrived and there were only two pieces in all of the calamari.  I asked our waitress Winnie if this was normal, and she said it was.  She explained the dish further to me and told us next time we could request extra artichokes.  Then two minutes later she came back with a bowl of artichokes for us, as she said my girlfriend's face looked like her dog had died when she found out the lack of artichoke was normal.  That was awesome of her. ...  ... For our main course, I took the waitress's recommendation of the rib eye, and my girlfriend had the prawns.  Neither of us were disappointed.  Her prawns were big and had a great flavor to them.  My steak was prepared to perfection... probably the best rib eye I've ever eaten.  I didn't even need the sauce I had ordered. ...  ... We were stuffed when Winne brought the dessert menu, but we looked it over anyways.  Chocolate filled donut holes with two dipping sauces?  How do we say no to that.  Let's just say we were overstuffed when we left. ...  ... Our entire bill pre-discount was $102, so $51.  Oh how I wish it was always $51 for this meal.  Worth it at $102, but probably going to save my pennies and hope they run this promotion at their 6 year anniversal.  Well done, Boa.
52	3	1	1	1	Not very impressed with this spot.  The food was mediocre and of course the prices are high.  Service was mediocre at best...nothing exceptional. ...  ... It was extremely bright inside as well and I wished it was a little darker.  There are better steakhouses out there for the price you pay.  I heard the BoA in LA is a lot better I would avoid this one if I am spending that much money
52	4	0	0	0	There were two very large trade shows in town and it was the week leading up to the Super Bowl so finding a table was going to be tough.  Boa was able to sit us within 30 minutes. ...  ... We spent our 30 minutes in the bar/lounge area.  It is a nice area, and they have a very good wine and liquor selection. ...  ... We were fortunate enough to get a seat by a window.  We were able to catch a glimpse of the strip and saw the fountain show at the Bellagio while we waited for our meal. ...  ... The food is very good.  I orderd the filet mignon medium rare with a blue cheese crust.  It was prepared perfectly and tasted great.  The food is ala carte so we ordered the onion brick and truffle oil fries for the table.  The onion brick was ok.  The fries were great.  I love fries prepared in truffle oil. ...  ... The service we recieved was very good.  The environment is great.  It is worth the money for the occasional special meal.
52	3	0	0	0	The service was excellent and our waiter had a couple good wine recommendations but several people in our group of 8 felt the steaks were overpriced and overcooked. My 40 month aged NY steak was tough on the edges and not very pink inside even though I ordered med-rare. I had to dip the steak in a side of sauce to take away the dryness. I would recommend Ruth Chris over these  steaks and I usually like non chains.
52	4	0	0	0	First I have to say that this place has excellent service.  Waiters were extremely prompt and very polite.  We were initially sitting inside but when we requested to sit on the balcony, they quickly moved our party.  The view from the balcony is amazing the the ambiance is perfect for a romantic dinner or a classy dinner for a bachelors party which is what we had.   ...  ... As for the food, the calamari was awesome and everyone agreed it was one of the best we'd ever had.  They also gave us some complimentary appetizer which had cheese and tomatoes on lays potato chips which were delicious! ...  ... Most of us ended up ordering the 40 day old steak.  I've had much better steak for half the price.  Wasn't impressed at all to be honest.  Overall, I would have given it a 5 star if it wasn't for the steak.  I would definitely go back though!
52	5	0	0	0	Be prepared to spend, but it is well worth it! I came here again after originally going here a couple of years ago. This place is great.  ...  ... I started off in the bar while we waited to be seated. I had the dapper gent, which was delicious. When seated I basically had what I had last time because it was so good. I ordered the New York steak with veggies and fries. It was fantastic! I recommend coming to BOA. I'm sure I will be eating here yet again sometime in the future. Its that good!!
52	3	2	1	2	Located in the huge maze that is Ceaser's palace, is Boa steakhouse. Having arrived to dinner just an hour after landing in sin city, I was pretty famished. I ordered the Ribeye, medium-rare. It came with an interesting flowery-type arrangement of baked garlic cloves (not to be bitten into, trust me). The steak was overall, just okay. For the price, I really wanted to give it two stars because it was fatty, underseasoned, and bland. Because, I was in such a big party, they gave us complimentary donut holes. Again, okay, but not great. Bill was a little much but so are the clubs.
52	4	0	1	0	Very nice place, however it was a little tough to get to solely because of where in the Forum Shops it is located.    If you take cab - it is a long walk from the taxi stand.   If you walk, it is basically right inside from the Strip entrance on 3rd floor.   (I would walk it if you can) ...  ... There were 14 of us in our party, so we were smartly assigned 2 waiters to keep control of things.
52	4	0	0	0	We had lunch here, and was super solid, and prices were fare for a steakhouse, and for the quality of ingredients. The Goat Cheese Baklava Appetizer is out of this world. With shaved truffle and pistachio with drizzles of hot honey. The Quality of the goat cheese can not be understated. Small portion, but extraordinary flavor. The Boa Cobb presentation is very nice, and the Chop Chop salad a solid starter featuring toasted pine nuts, salumi, and chick peas is a winner. And although they no longer had the Steak Sandwich on the menu they used to have, the waiter had the chef make it for me. Very nice. Grilled Beef Tenderloin on French Bread, with oven roasted tomatoes, maytag bleu cheese, and garlic mayo. WOW. so good. Got bowl of fresh fruit with it instead of fries. Fresh.Quality....GReat lunch.  2 salads, 1 Entree size.. Appetizer. Steak Sandwich with Side. 2 sodas, Tax, 20% tip =$75. We enjoyed lunch.
52	5	0	1	1	One of the best steaks I have ever had.  A little spendy but it is worth it.  Sit on the patio on a nice night.  You get a great view of the strip.  Drinks are also really good.  Would definitely go again.
52	4	0	0	1	Compared to the other 'elite' steakhouses in Vegas, BOA is very inexpensive (still expect $40-$50 entrees though) which drew our group of 8 here.  ...  ... That being said, the service was helpful and quick. The food was well prepared and presented, and very tasty. The drink menu was a little on the sugary side, but the bartender clearly was worth his salt as my group ordered a large variety of cocktails. The steak was very good, but not among the best I've ever had. I've had $20 steaks in other places of similar quality.  ...  ... All in all, it was $110 a person which included appetizers, entrees, tip, tax, and drinks. For a special occasion in a place like Vegas, definitely a pretty decent deal.
52	4	0	0	0	There are so many steakhouses in Vegas to choose from, but I've heard good reviews about BOA from numerous websites. I was expecting a better view of the strip, but it still wasn't bad. The filet was good, not great. If you're a fish lover, the sea bass is perfect; it melts in your mouth with every bite.  ...  ... I'd recommend getting the caesar salad as an appetizer-they make the dressing at your table! The mac n cheese is a very good side dish. Going for a birthday sweetens everything because they give you a huge candle that sparkles at your table. I was impressed, but it was a little overpriced. What do you expect for Vegas though.
52	5	0	0	0	best steak and service in Vegas. The filet mignon and bone-in filet were tender and juicy, amazing. Do get the chocolate-filled donuts, not on the menu, for dessert....orgasmic. Great atmosphere and music...highly recommended to anyone who wants an amazing steak at a great place.
52	3	0	0	0	The BOA 405 cocktail is a must and possibly my favorite thing about the dining experience.  My filet was decent but I've had better, the lobster was slightly fishy and the potatoes with cheddar and bacon were runny.  The place was also oddly empty for 8:30 PM on a Thursday.  My advice is to grab a cocktail and sit on the patio over looking the strip.
52	5	0	0	0	Fantastic food and service.  My wife and I both had the filet - each was cooked perfectly to our specifications.  The lobster mashed potatoes were great, and the desserts were wonderful.  Its away from the casino so there was no smoky air.  The staff was extremely attentive.  It was an anniversary dinner and our desserts were accompanied with a firework.  Will be back.  The occasion was perfect.  Thanks BOA!
52	5	1	2	1	I give it 5 stars because I remember the porterhouse I had.  It was one of those steaks that I remember which means its good.  Its not cheap, but the food was awesome so its worth it.  The sides were equally amazing.  We shared a few different choices as a group and all left very happy.
52	3	0	0	0	So I was headed for Casa Fuente, but, with no food in over eight hours, decided to hit BOA before a nice bone.  Upon arriving, ordered a Diet Pepsi (denied...diet coke only) and a chicken sandwich w/fries. ...  ... So the fries were, while a bit greasy, good. The sandwich?  Well, the meat was, while sparse, real.  The "swiss cheese" was...um....interesting.  The bun was HUGE.  Overly so.  REALLY overly so. ...  ... The service was awesome. Sat at the bar, and the bartender was all over making sure I was satisfied.    I ate about half the (sparse) meat, and left the HUGE bun alone, along with the 24 gallons of fries.  He was truly concerned that I wasn't happy with the meal.  Kudos. ...  ... Overall, I was kinda disappointed, given the hype of BOA.  But, it WAS a lunch (and late, at that), so I gave 'em a bit of slack.
52	5	0	0	0	Came with my boyfriend just to have some good steak. Fantastic steak is what we had. My Filet Mignon felt like butter in my mouth. It melted and tasted so good. It seemed kind of salty on the outside, but I guess that meshes with the thickness. I like the sauce it comes with too. Boyfriend had a Bleu-cheese crusted New York, which was good also, but not nearly as melt-in-your-mouth as my Filet. He did enjoy the crust, it had just enough flavor not to overpower the steak. We also had mushrooms and baked potato as sides. The mushrooms were delicious, loved every bite. The baked potato was huge! Probably wasn't needed since we were overly full by the end of our meal. ...  ... I loved the ambiance here, the dark room and fancy decorations. Service was great! Our waiter was very nice.
52	4	0	1	0	Just recently got back from a trip to Vegas, and went to BOA on mostly positive Yelp recommendations. I can definitely say that it was a great experience, but I can't give it five stars. ...  ... The good: ...  ... The soup of the day was a broccoli-crabmeat soup, which tasted more like broccoli cheddar, and was very good. It was a little thin, as it appeared almost to be puree'd (sp?), but tasted great. ...  ... For an entree, I got the filet, and my wife ordered the Kobe flat-iron steak. The one snafu of the night was when they brought a filet for my wife. We informed the waiter of the mix-up, and he was very apologetic and went to correct the mistake. Amazingly enough, within 5 minutes, a the correct entree came out, cooked to perfection.  ...  ... The service was very good, and the food was wonderful. The other thing dragging down the rating would be the dessert: We were so stuffed, but decided to split a dessert - the smores dessert. It was a brownie with some sort of marshmallow topping. Unfortunately, the brownie almost tasted store-bought, and the marshmallow topping was very bland. On top of that, it came out room temperature. All in all, it wasn't a BAD dessert - just disappointing for a place of this caliber.  ...  ... I'd definitely go back to this restaurant, but potentially try different menu items.
52	1	0	0	0	My first rule of dinning is to only eat at places that are busy. I do this because I like to know that other people find it to be good enough to come back but more importantly I know the food is fresh. Put it this way, I've watched too many episodes of Kitchen Nightmares to even chance a restaurant in a great area with no one in it. With that said we didn't get past the bar at BOA. It was 6:45 on a friday night in Las Vegas and we were to only people in the restaurant. On this night we finished our drink and made our way to Joe's just down stairs.
52	1	0	0	0	I would rather throw my money into a fire fit than spend it here. ...  ... They don't know how to cook steaks, the food has no flavor, and their "crab" tasted like it was frozen and in a can.  There was a group of 10 of us and we unanimously agreed this place was one of the worst steakhouses we'd been to.  I've had better steak at Norm's for a fourth of the price.
52	3	0	0	0	My fiance & I decided to take advantage of restaurant week, so we made a reservation at BOA.  This is the sister of Sushi Roku (right next door in the new mall) but different in service and food.  We arrived 10 minutes early for our reservation of 8:45pm and we asked how much longer it would be at 9:00.  The host & hostess said they were setting a table, but at 9:15 we were still sitting in the bar very hungry.  We walked out to the entrance and stood so that we were not being forgotten.  It worked and we were sat a few minutes later.  Our waiter was wonderful and the food was delicious and the Manager came and apologized for the delay directly.  They also comped our two drinks.  It was very busy, so we will give them another chance on a less busy day.  The tuna tar tar, salmon on spinach & donut hole dessert were wonderful & there were a nice variety of people.  Will review again after the 2nd chance in the future.
52	4	0	0	0	It's a good steak place, I'm a steak lover and they have a prix fix menu, which you can save if you want a salad, sides & dessert.  ...  ... For appetizer we got the seared tuna pieces & calamari & this weird sweetish thing. the tuna pieces were good, but they put like flakes of seasalt in it and it tasted weird when you ate it, but the tuna was good. Calamari was good, and the weird sweet pastry like thing, it was okay. more like a dessert than an appetizer/ ...  ... I got the prix fix menu. I thought it was a good deal. I got the kobe flat iron, it was cooked to perfection. I got medium rare and it was medium rare! Love it. I also tried a little piece of my sister's filet and it was nice and tender, melts in your mouth. The sides were okay, fries weren't any specials, and the mushrooms were okay, it woulda been better if they were all portebello mushrooms.  ...  ... Dessert: creme burlee, so disappointed. I love creme burlee, but their creme burlee was not great. It was thick and chunky. I love my creme burlee to be creamy and silky. not a fan of their dessert. ...  ... overall, steaks are great here! they dont come on a hot plate =(
52	3	0	0	0	This place is at the top of the forum shops where they make you go around and around the shops before you can even get in the restaurant. ...  ... My bone-in rib eye was super fatty.  My friend's filet was done too well.  The price is about the same as Joe's downstairs and Joe's actually had never let me down.   ...  ... The ambiance is cool but the place is strangely empty sometimes.  If I had to do it again, I would stick with Craftsteak as the best steak in Vegas.  If you have to stay around Caesars, goto Joe's.
52	3	1	1	0	Although the service was TERRIBLE, the food was so good! ...  ... SERVICE:  ... I hate this place for being so effin snobby and forgetful.  I made a reservation at 8:15pm and was running late because of traffic on the strip, so I called to extend it to 8:30pm to be safe, which Ashley (she was very helpful) was very kind about.  She extended it without a question, and even told me the lines for the valet wasn't long.  We walked in around 8:18pm and still had to wait until 9:00 to be seated because according to the other girl in front, "I called in to extend my reservation and now I will have to wait longer".  So basically even if I had a reservation at 8:30pm it would have not mattered to her.  People that walked in without a reservation got seated before us, and we only had a party of FOUR people.  Anyway... ...  ... FOOD:  ... We ordered the Crab Cake, BOA Burger, Spaghetti with Kobe Meatballs, Kobe Filet Mignon and Truffled Cheese Fries.  I loved everything!  ... The Crab Cake has got to be my favorite out of all the food, because I am not a huge meat fan and would rather eat crustacean.  The crab just melted in my mouth and was so juicy and crispy at the same time.  $20 ... The BOA Burger was 'incredible' at the least.  It was so yummy and juicy.  It came with fries on the side and was of really good quality. $28. ... The Spaghetti with Kobe Meatballs was just okay.  I expected better, because the spaghetti itself tasted really cheaply made and you couldn't really taste the Kobe flavor in the meatballs. $25. ... The Kobe Filet Mignon on the other hand... was melt in your mouth delicious!  We didn't add any rub or sauce with it, because its fine on its own. :) $53 ... The Truffled Cheese Fries were good also, the cheese on it was really yummy and creamy.   $12. ... For dessert, our server brought us chocolate filled donut holes with a sparkler for a birthday we were celebrating.  It was so good, although I'm not a fan of sugar coated anything.  ...  ... Other than the service, I would come here again.
52	4	0	0	1	I walked up at 8pm on a Saturday night and asked for a table for 2.  I was seated right away.  Sherman was the captain for that night.  He was great.  I ordered 2 bone in fillets, mac n cheese, mushrooms, creamed spinach, baked potato, 2 glasses of wine, and panna cotta for dessert.  He told us about the locations in LA because my mom was visiting me from out of town and lived there.  After learning about those locations, he gave us his card and told us who to ask for at the other locations and assured us that we would be taken care of there as well.   ...  ... I admit I should have ordered a bottle, but my mom quits on me after a glass then I'm stuck trying to drink thing and drive home after drinking 3 glasses.  I'm not a very big girl, so that is a lot of alcohol.  Anyway, my glasses came out, they were great.  While the wine list was good, I believe that other restaurants such as Delmonico have better lists.  What was great was Sherman put in for us to have truffle oil nachos to go with the wine.  Great pairing!  The nachos almost stole the show from the steak.  They were great!   ...  ... Next was the bread...  That has to be one of my favorite rolls and butter in a restaurant bar none.  After that was the steaks and sides.  The steaks were great.  Now was it the best bone in fillet I've had? No.  Was it the best steak in LA, such as the staff told me? No.  But was it in the top 5? Yes!  Places that beat it for me by a long shot are Mastro's and Cut.  Don't get me wrong, this is one great cut of meat, but there are better out there.   ...  ... As for the sides, they are alright.  Truffle oil mac n cheese-- It was good.  Will it replace a craving for the mac n cheese at Mastro's? No.  Creamed spinach-- It was okay.  Again, there is better at Delmonico and Morton's and Porterhouse Bistro and STK and The Palms and... honestly, just about every other steakhouse I've been at.  Mushrooms-- There were the standout and gone first at the table.  Baked potato--  I only had a taste, as this is more of a dish my mom loves, but I did like the fact that it came with everything including cheese.  Then again, I love just about anything with cheese and potatoes. ...  ... My dessert was great... I was given 2 spoons with the panna cotta.  It also came with roasted pears, which was tricky with a spoon.  I finally gave up and just had cream.  My espresso was better than what I've had at most restaurants by far.  And they did not bring out sugar with it.  I've always found that to be peculiar when they bring out sugar.  Who puts sugar in their espresso?  That's another rant for another day... as is the snobby valet guy who would not valet my car until I said I was eating at Boa.  Then he opened my door and said, "Welcome to Forum Shops."... Yeah, thanks, jerk. ...  ... All in all, Boa serves great cuts of meat with great service for that style.  Most of the sides leave something to be desired, but I never had to ask for anything twice.  Sherman is a great captain at this restaurant.
52	5	0	0	0	This place was top notch. We asked for a table with a view and were taken out to a beautiful balcony overlooking the strip. Throughout dinner we looked at Paris and the Bellagio watershow. Absolutely stunning. ... Dinner was so great.  Had tuna tartare, Chilean sea bass grilled and petite filet. Pricey but nothing you wouldn't expect from a popular upscale steakhouse. Completely worth it, will definitely be back!!
52	5	0	0	0	The food was great, the service was awesome! Our waiter Charles was the greatest! So helpful and nice! It was our friends birthday and he comp'd us these truffle nachos, soooo goood!; took off the cork-age fee (well we did buy another $300 bottle soo...); and comp'd us the dessert donuts! So awesome!! I had the wagyu, it was delish! Side dishes, we had the loaded mash potatoes (yum), the mac and cheese (double yum!), and the roasted corn (my fav!!) Husband has the bone in ribeye was really good! and added a lobster tail which was Gigantic!! Overall it was the best dining experience i've had in Vegas and it wasn't even in one of those Thomas Keller or Food Network Star owned restaurants! This is a definite must! And if you can you should eat out side on their patio there's a great view of the strip and all the lights!
52	3	0	0	0	BOA Steakhouse in Cesaer's Palace lacks the luster and draw of it's starry Santa Monica counterpart.  It lacks the execution found at StripSteak, CraftSteak, and N9NE.  Think of it as a minor league steakhouse with major league prices. ...  ... I recently dined at BOA with a group of 14 friends.  They were very friendly and accommodating; for a large group on a Friday night, this was a welcome surprise.  While a pleasant staff great, the food was not. ...  ... We explored the whole menu, ordering a variety of steaks, sides, and seafood.  The oysters were very fresh, and served at the right temperature.  The sides were fine, but the real red flag went up when we got our steaks. ...  ... All of our steaks came out desert dry, regardless of how they were cooked.  This was most likely due to not letting the meat rest after it was taken off the grill.  This is a total rookie move, and a mortal sin for any self-respecting chef.   ...  ... BOA is fine if you have a large group and a last minute change of plans, but there are many better options on the strip.
52	5	0	1	0	I had to coordinate a coed Bachelor/Bacheloretter dinner for 26 people and BOA was extrememely accomodating to our large party. It was the only high-end restaurant I called that did not need me to place my arm and leg for a security deposit. They were also the most lenient on changing my reservation. I must have change my reseveration size 5 different times. ...  ... Onto the food now. Since we had such a large party, I had to do a fix menu. There were different tiers and styles to choose from but I ended up choosing the tapas style dinner. This is perfect since there wasn't overly expensive nor too filling. It was enough food to satisfy us but not enough to send us into a food coma before we went out for the night. ...  ... Great atmosphere, great service, and great food.
52	3	0	0	0	So, I was in Vegas on a business trip this past weekend, and for a Saturday night dinner, decided to try BOA Steakhouse located at Cesaer's Palace. Although the drinks were pretty good, but food was ok. I ordered the Bone-in Ribeye, and it was ok. I have had better steak, but I have had worse. However, he Calamari appetizer was very good and the Chilean Sea Bass that my business partner ordered was not too bad. Overall, amongst steakhouses, I would try something else before coming back here.  ...  ... On another note, the ambiance was very nice and the staff was very exceptional.
52	4	0	1	1	Came here to celebrate completing my third half marathon and was not disappointed! The ambiance is open yet dark and rather trendy.  ...  ... I had a $50 gift certificate thanks to a Living Social deal which definitely helped with the bill; but even without I think it would have been worth it. ...  ... Things got off to a good start when a server brought out warm rolls which were crusty on the outside and doughy/flaky on the inside, almost like a croissant. ...  ... For 3, we ordered 2 salads and both were yummy! Fresh and flavorful!  ...  ... For dinner I got the bone in filet mignon, by far my favorite cut of meat and even more so when I can find it with the bone-in. Came out perfectly cooked rare.  ...  ... Side of truffled mac and cheese was DELICIOUS! While it looked a little small, it was so rich the portion was perfect. For other less rich sides, I am not sure if the price is justified for the size. ...  ... Definitely worth a visit.
52	2	0	1	0	I hate to say it, but I'm not a fan of BOA's lunch.  I was so looking forward to a great lunch experience, since it is a very popular restaurant among the stars.  Unfortunately the food was dry, bland, and boring, much like this review.  Will I eat here again?--maybe.  I'll give dinner a try and update this review in about six months.
52	3	0	0	0	We were in the area and looking for a nice place to have lunch. The rating, location, decor and price had my expectations a bit high when I first saw this place, I guess having those expectations was not a good thing.  ...  ... Ordered:  ... Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes  ... Chantrelle Mushroom & Tellagio Cheese Bruschetta  ... Organic Baby Green Salad  ... Classic Prime Tuna Burger  ...  ... The Crab Cakes and Chantrelle Bruschetta were and excellent start off. I was thinking that these flavors were excellent. The salad was also very good. Nice fresh baby greens and cherry tomatoes with that vinaigrette dancing around them made my mouth happy.  ...  ... I wanted something different and light so I went with the Classic Prime Tuna Burger. I was excited to see what measure of creativity went into the making of this burger at an upper scale restaurant such as this. Sad to say the burger was a bit bland. It felt like the symphony was coming to a crescendo but the conductor tripped and fell off the podium. I liked the fries that accompanied the dish. The next time I come here I guess I'll stick to the steaks or just order a bunch of appetizers.
52	4	0	0	1	This place is a tradition by now; friends and I come here at least once a year. We love especially the table side Caesar and the truffled mac & cheese. Recently, I diverted and got the Bleu cheese wedge salad that I found to be very refreshing. I ordered the New York strip medium rare, cooked to perfection, but I couldn't finish it! What a shame, because it was so good. I foolishly ordered a baked potato on the side, which was gigantic but very well prepared. I also ordered the asparugus spears; they were delish and made my pee stink real good. I love BOA!
52	4	0	0	0	Ceasar salad. Normally, I would have passed on the offer but the allure of table side creation pulled me in. Hands down the best ceasar salad I have had in a restaurant. The preparation was excellent. Notably the ingredients included tobacco sauce which added a wonderful kick and picked up the garlic flavor. I am not a fan of Vegas steakhouses but now I sing a different song. Don't miss this experience (and the view is pretty remarkable).
52	4	2	5	3	A coworker raved about his dinner at BOA Steakhouse.  At the time I have never heard of the restaurant, and BOA only conjures up images of a bank or the popular Korean singer. A few weeks later, I bought a Groupon for BOA ($25 for $50 worth of food and drinks) so I can go try it out for myself. ...  ... Making the reservation was painless and easy.  But finding the restaurant itself was a little tougher, since it is located a bit off the beaten path (3rd floor of the Caesar's Palace Forum Shop). ... The restaurant itself was very nice, but when I arrived for my early reservation, only the front part and the bar was opened for seating. ...  ... My waitress was friendly and handed me my menu (for lunch) shortly after I picked out and sat at my table, but gave me the dinner menu once I asked for it. ...  ... The menu options look interesting, with the typical categories of items found at steakhouses. ...  ... For my appetizer I went with the Goat Cheese Bakalava served with pistachio, black truffles and a few pieces of frissee ($14).  I liked it, plus it was different from the usual steakhouse appetizers. Definitely worth a try if you are feeling adventurous. ...  ... And selected the 21-days Dry Aged Bone-In Rib-eye and opted for the Blue Cheese Crust (it was that or Foie Gras Butter), the waitress also brought out their Signature J-1 Sauce (tomato based, with Sriracha for that extra spicy kick, even thought it was pretty mild).  The steak had nice flavor, a great blue cheese crust, but slightly over done (probably after broiling the blue cheese crust).  ...  ... After that I was looking forward to a refreshing dessert, but most of the desserts found on their menu didn't look appealing or were too typical for me at the time, and I eventually opted to get a scoop of gelato instead.  ...  ... Decor - 4/5  Nice and elegant. ... Food - 4/5 I enjoyed everything I ordered. ... Service - 4/5 Friendly, not high pressure. ... Price - Pricey, but it is a steakhouse and one located inside a Las Vegas casino no less. ... Location - 3/5 needed directions from the receptionist/hostess to navigate my way there. ...  ... Overall 4/5.   ...  ... If you have local ID, you can get 20% off.  Not a bad deal.
52	3	0	0	0	This is a real let-down of a Steakhouse.  Are they even serving Prime Beef?  I really hope so, but can't tell from their steaks. ...  ... That being said, their Kobe burger is pretty good for lunch, and you can get sushi as your side.  Talk about a decadent Vegas lunch.  It's my signature.
52	2	0	1	1	Two stars because the service and ambience were good. The goat cheese baklava was a very pleasant surprise as well, delish. You could put goat cheese on a cat turd and it would be good, so it's kind of like cheating. ... Aside from that, this place is a huge rip off. Two entrees, salads, two drinks and one dessert should never be $190 plus tip. I don't care where you are, that is just pure bullshit. I've often said that if I can do a better job with my limited education, expertise and intelligence this place has a problem. Boa has a huge problem. My Alberston's rib eye for $4.99 a pound tastes better and is more tender on my Char Broil low end grill than Boa's. The Flat Iron NY Strip was good, not great. I'm still sick to my stomach over the price of that mediocre meal. Save your money, go somewhere else. I hear the Gold Coast and Circus-Circus have good steak houses and it might be worth checking those out if you're in town and you don't have access to my grill.
52	4	0	1	0	I had the center cut ahi tuna with wasabi mashed potatoes, bok choy and shitake mushrooms. It was the best seared tuna I've ever had, hands down. The tuna was cooked perfectly, was cut properly and just melted in my mouth. The sauce was a salty, dark, wine-based masterpiece. The mashed potatoes had the subtle hint of wasabi, but it was not overpowering.  The mushrooms added some great texture and flavor. The bok choy was the weakest part of this dish I think- it was a little too mushy for my taste. Overall, I still loved this dish. Also, as a side note, the bread that they serve is fantastic. They have these rosemary rolls that were fresh out of the oven, hot and tasty. The butter there is also crazy. It tasted just like normal butter, but the texture was somewhere between whipped and liquid- almost like sour cream. I think the point was to make it easy to spread. It was a nice little luxury. ...  ... I'm not sure about the steak, as I didn't have any, but I did have a bite of the lobster one of my friends ordered from the surf and turf, and the lobster was amazing. My dish was $40, not bad for the best tuna ever. The surf and turf ended up being $150, which I wouldn't have paid if I'd known it was going to be that much. I would have paid 100 for it though. That lobster was good.  ...  ... The atmosphere was nice, a little dark for my taste, but that's how most steak houses are. It wasn't too hard to get a reservation on Saturday night, and the place was on the noisier end, but not enough for you to really notice. The waiting staff was quick and they were very on top of their water and bread refills. They give out these funny super sparkler candles stuck in a container full of sugar crystals for your birthday. They're pretty entertaining for the 10 seconds they burn.  ...  ... I would definitely come to this place again. I'd probably give this place 4.5 stars if I could. I'm just holding out on that 5 star rating because I don't know what the steak was like. This is a steakhouse, after all. If I go again and have the steak, I'll update this post.
52	4	0	0	0	All in all this was a great experience. We were initially nervous because it was not very busy. We had a small party of 4 that was seated immediately with no reservations. The staff was attentive and the food was very good. Will definitely go back.
52	4	0	0	0	I went to BOA a couple of months ago with my girlfriend for a romantic date. I had super high expectations from the start. The staff there was very friendly and made you feel comfortable. We first started the night with some amazing drinks that the waiters recommended. When I opened the menu I was blown away with the prices of the steaks, but I said lets do it. The steaks we ordered were top of the line greatness. I tad bit out of my price range but well worth it. I believe I went into a food comma after we left because that was the end of my night. I cant wait until my next Vegas trip, I will go back to BOA.
52	3	0	0	0	place was ok, nothing to rave about!
52	5	0	0	0	I am writing this almost 6 months too late.  My husband and I ate here back in October as a pre-first anniversary celebratory dinner.  I have to say in all sincerity that this was probably the best meal I've ever eaten at a restaurant. ...  ... We had trouble choosing a place before we went out to Vegas but I came across a Groupon for BOA about a month before we left.  So I bought it and made reservations for 8pm on a Friday night via opentable.com.   ...  ... It took us a little while to find it because we weren't staying in Caesars and that place is a bit of a maze.  I also have to take part of the blame because I was wearing heels so I couldn't walk as fast :) ...  ... I had read reviews on trip advisor to ask for a table on the terrace.  That was an excellent tip!  I asked the hostess and she accomodated us with no problem.  We were seated pretty much immediately and had a fantastic view of the Strip on a gorgeous October evening.  The ambiance played a big role in how much we enjoyed our experience. ...  ... I really wish I could remember our waiters' names.  They were phenomenal.  All of their suggestions knocked it out of the park.  We started with drinks, a BOA 405 for me and a local beer for my husband.  Both drinks were delicious.  We skipped appetizers because we wanted to indulge on side items.   ...  ... My husband ordered the 40 day dry aged NY Strip and I had the petit filet with creamy horseradish sauce.  For our sides we ordered the truffle mac and cheese, sauteed seasonal mushrooms and chipotle lime corn (at the suggestion of our watier).  All of our food was delicous.  I cannot rave about the chipotle lime corn enough.  It was something I would never have ordered myself but it blew me away.  Our steaks were cooked perfectly and we enjoyed everything, except the truffle mac and cheese.  But that's not due to the restaurant.  I just don't like truffle oil. ...  ... All in all it was a wonderful experience and I'd recommend it and hope to return there on my next visit to Las Vegas.
52	5	0	4	2	What can I say? Overpriced? Yea, probably so. But it was one of, if not the best dinner of my life.  ... Started with drinks at the bar, I think they're might have been a drop or two of cranberry juice the rest was pure Belvedere bliss!! After just one drink, it felt like I was floating to our very private, romantic window booth that overlooked the strip. Our waiter was fabulous and very helpful. We asked about the Kobe flat iron simply because we didn't know what it was and it was the only inexpensive cut on the menu. He explained it and we both knew it was not what we wanted. We went the filet mingon-you can't go wrong with the filet. And if your going to spend the money, you might as well spend ALL the money!!  ...  ... Everything is a la carte so when you order your cut that's all you get. We each ordered a side; truffle macaroni & cheese and butternut squash. Ok, the filet was delicious. Every bite melted in your mouth. We didn't order any of the rubs or sauces they offer-we just wanted pure beef in all it's glory. The filets were prepared to perfection. But I know it won't be the last perfect filet I eat so let's get back to those sides. The butternut squash was delicious. Tender, sweet with an ever so slight kick to it. Great veggie choice. The truffle mac & cheese was out of this world. To die for. The most amazing mac & cheese I've ever had or ever will have. It was rich and creamy. The truffles gave it the most unbelievable and luxurious flavor. Yes!! It was pure luxury. If mac & cheese were cars,  a box of kraft would be a moped from the late 70's and BOA's truffle mac & cheese is a Bugatti.  ...  ... Dessert did not disappoint. We ordered the special dessert-it may have been a Valentines special since we were there Valentines weekend. It was warm sugared doughnut holes with a Godiva heart in the middle served with warm caramel & vanilla sauces to dip these warm, doughy, sugary pieces of heaven into. It was so delish and the most perfect ending to a most perfect dinner.  ...  ... So the price of this dinner for just the two us-which was 2 drinks, 2 filets, 2 sides, 1 dessert + tip was just about $200. Yes, looking back that seems extreme, but that night and in that moment, it was worth every single penny. Everyone deserves a dinner like this, at least once a year.
52	5	0	1	1	One of the nicest restaurant I've been to. The food was really good especially the lobster tail, the chef cut it after he served it to me and had a variety of water to choose from. After I finished a plate it was taken away in no time. The people were very polite. Overall the dinner was amazing, the dimmed lights all around were nice too.Towards the end spent about $315 with 4 people not including a few free deserts the chef gave us, so we tipped him $85.
52	3	0	0	0	I ate here a few months ago and had the $50 Groupon for lunch since the expiration date snuck up on me and I had to use on the day it expired.  ... The place was quite empty for lunch and I asked for the dinner menu. ... I started out with the Goat Cheese Bakava. This was as good an appetizer Ihave had anywhere and wanted to lick the pate clean. If I knew this would be this unreal I would of ordered 3 of these. For my meal I had the 40 Dry aged New York strip and Bacon/Cheddar Potatoes.  ...  ... The potatoes were ok but, nothing special and the steak was very tough and had a strange flavor. I am unsure if this is because of it being dry aged or not but, I really did not like it. However I will try the restaurant  again someday but, I am not in a rush.
52	5	0	0	0	This place is legid! that's the word I would use. I had the riibeye and mannnnnn was it good! This place is right up there with top steakhouses like Mastro's
52	5	0	0	0	So walking in and checking in with the hostess, i was expecting the worse service of my life the two girls were extremely RUDE....However, ignoring the catastrophe I went directly to the bar, were i met the greatest BARtender of all time !!!! Eric!!!! i ordered my usual Tanagra Martini and with that received a sample of a drink that he made for a couple next to me..... After given a few samples i was off to dinner with my group.... The meal was top 10 one of the best... I recommend the bone in steak medium rear, so delicious and tender you can practically cut your meat with a fork.... Other then the great entree the sides were delicious, i most defiantly have to recommend the Mac and Cheese not your average dish at all... With all the delicious food going around a friend of mine ordered a drink from the bar and with his drink came along a mini shot of the drink he was drinking from ERIC....... Nothing like a mini surprise to top the night...Other then the start of the night the rest was perfect.
52	4	0	0	0	Our waiter was great, he knew the menu very well and helped our nice big party of 8 guys associate their meals.  The table side caesar is a must try, and the complimentary rolls are a perfect moist.  The steaks came out just the way we asked.   ...  ... I'd pass on the desserts though, it was no where complimenting the food.  That's why it lost a star.
52	3	0	0	0	Waaaaaaaaaaaaaay overpriced... but they did surprise me with a better-than-expected meal. 3.5 stars. ...  ... We had a large party, so we were assigned a pre-fixe meal. Okay, so $100 a person got us only a petite filet, and some appetizers and dessert served family-style, so it was VERY overpriced. However, I was pleasantly surprised.  ...  ... The appetizers were okay but not mind-blowing... steak tartare was okay, crab cake was decent, and the truffle nachos just seemed like Lays potato chips with some truffle oil and melted cheese on top. Meh. ...  ... The steak was larger than I expected for a "petite", and it was perfectly cooked. The flavor was pretty good, as well. ...  ... The sides that came with the meal was probably the highlight. The truffle mac-n-cheese was EXCELLENT.. with macaroni (more like.. pasta) that was cooked al dente, and a distinct truffle flavor. Too bad they kind of went stingy on that one and didn't give us enough plates. The creamed spinach was good, and the fried crispy onions, though not special by any means, served as a decent filler.  ...  ... The chocolate-filled beginets with dipping sauces and the chocolate cake were great. I didn't care so much for the s'mores thing and the cheesecake, but they weren't bad. ...  ... Okay, so the perfect indicator of the ridiculous cost of this restaurant is that their wines had a 2.5-3x markup. Ripping us off, don't you think?
52	5	0	0	0	Boa is amazing! great steaks, great sides. Get the 405 Martini, have them make it with Tanqueray 10 Gin, you will not regret it.
52	4	0	1	1	Okay, this is the second time I've been here. The first time, I literally had one bite of the strip steak(was super drunk/hungover). It was so tasty I came back to actually have an entire portion this time. It was good. As was the porterhouse, the ribeye, and the kobe flat iron. Next time i will have the kobe flat iron. it was offered as part of a $65 prix fixe menu. And it was heaven. ...  ... Service was excellent. The staff also sent out a special dessert with a sparkler candle for the new college graduate we were celebrating. ...  ... The ladies in the group seemed to really like the "crush" drink offered. Has a very distinctive lychee flavor.  ...  ... Easy to reserve, good food, good service.
52	5	0	1	0	Of course in Las Vegas you have your choice of wonderful food. It's rare to have a below average meal here.  ...  ... BOA and Craftsteak really stand out in Vegas as far as Steakhouses go. My experience at BOA was extraordinary. The hostess sat us on the balcony overlooking the strip, including the Bellagio Fountains- we had the best seat on the strip for that show while sipping the most amazing cocktail I have EVER had. Their signature cocktail has won awards and understandably so. The ingredients may sounds strange- namely the balsamic vinegar, but they work so well together I could have had 6 of them (and almost did)! ...  ... Their table side Caesar Salad is phenomenal as well. Of course their Steaks are great, but what really sets them apart is the small things, like the salad and their cocktails. I'll be sure to visit BOA again. Absolutely wonderful.
52	5	0	0	0	The brick chicken and the salmon are absolutely fantastic.
52	3	0	0	0	Well we both wanted a burger and were about to head to Burger Bar (tried and true), well yadda yadda yadda,  $150 bucks and this review later... ...  ... Once we got to BOA  we thought we should totally get steaks. So we did and ended up  full but disappointed. Drinks were good. Service was okay. Loved the decor. ...  ... I got the special (not with a special price) Oscar Filet, ordered medium rare. The server initially brought me the wrong meal, but promptly took it away and was replaced quickly with my correct order. The filet was a bit over medium rare, the lobster/crab mix on top was good, the bernaise sauce made the dish, helped moisten the steak and flavor the seafood. Asparagus on the side was good, done nicely. ... My husband (he wanted me to give them 2 stars) got the Rib Eye which we were told by the waiter is the best on the strip...it wasn't.  It too was ordered medium rare and was a bit over cooked. It was a bit dry and lacked seasoning. we asked for salt (there's none on the tables) and we got a dish of sea salt and truffled salt, which helped things. We shared the loaded mashed potatoes, they were too heavy and just tasted junked up, too much bacon and cheese. ...  ... We over all thought it was an alright experience, but totally not worth the money. Kicking myself...Should've just gotten the burger.
52	4	0	0	0	Excellent food, even better service.  It's not often that I'm impressed by yet another steakhouse, but BOA was very good.  I would recommend it for a nice romantic or small group dinner.
52	4	0	2	0	Went to Vegas for the weekend.  YEAAAA!  Even though I lost 3K gambling we did end up having a great dinner at BOA.  The place was nice and the booth seating was very comfortable.  I LOVE THEIR FRESH SALAD.  O my goodnes.  They literally wheel over a cart and make a fresh salad right in front of you.  They put all the herbs and spices into a bowl, make the dressing a presto.....fresh salad.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because although it was delicious (especially the donut holes for dessert)  i feel when you are paying $50 for a steak it should come out perfect everytime.  The steak they served me was tasty, but had more fat on it then real meat.  The most fatty steak I've ever had.  Granted it was a ribeye....but, you could clearly see how fatty it was.  I feel the cook should of thrown away instead of serving it.  But, other than that the place is great and you should definetley try it.  KUDOS to BOA
52	4	0	1	1	I'm torn, because I want to question everyone in Vegas as to why this place wasn't more crowded on a Fourth of July, because it is an excellent nite spot with views of the Strip that make you feel like you have a box seat; but then I also want to keep my mouth shut, so that I never have to worry about getting a reservation. Hmm..torn.  ...  ... We dined recently at this steakhouse located on the top floor of Caesar's Palace newest shopping area. It has an absolutely excellent view of the strip, you can even see the water show at Bellagio from the patio. It is a bit down there, but still.  ...  ... As far as the service goes, this has to be staffed with some of the most pleasant, professional people I have ever encountered. Too often, the attitude in retail and hospitality is really awful, but in this case, everyone was beyond.  ...  ... Our server was Michael C. or E. ( I wish I could remember) and he was helpful, nice and zero weird attitude...yay! ...  ... My pre-dinner cocktail was the Crush and it was very delicious, sparkling and slightly sweet.  ...  ... For dinner, my boyfriend started with clam chowder and it was delicious, more of a rich white broth with little bits of clam, than a heavy, creamy typical chowder. Very good. I started with a salad, which was, fresh, crisp and tasty. ...  ... We both ordered petite filet medallions and it was the perfect amount of food. It came with a blackberry reduction sauce, but we also ordered a side of the J-1 Sauce to try. Both great, but I think I did prefer the sauce the filet came with afterall. ...  ... Dessert came and we shared a creme brulee and the chocolate filled beignets. YUM. I love sugar a bit too much and these were no disappointment. The creme brulee is excellent, it is incredibly rich, creamy and served on the chilled side. Thank you! I really do not like warm, eggy brulee's which are more commonly served.  ...  ... If you are a person who loves the creme brulee at Nordstrom Cafe, then you would love it here too.  ...  ... After our dinner, we sat on the patio outside and waited for the 4th of July fireworks to start, but unfortunately weren't able to see any, so headed home and instead saw them shooting off from various neighborhoods along the 95. Great night, really.

I like to be consistent, not only because I order what I like, but it helps me to compare places fairly.  I got my usual Tanq gimlet and some drinks for my friends, and was wondering why it was taking a bit longer than usual seeing as we were the only ones at the bar.  I still dont know why, but when I got my drink, it was THE BEST, BY FAR gimlet I have ever had.  I couldnt stop talking about it or thinking about it (lush?).  Whatever they added or did, it was more balanced and sweeter. ...  ... When we were sat the real fun continued.  I ordered the NY since its what I always get and it happened to also be the most expensive item (46), along with a side of asparagus.  The bread they brought out for us while they prepared our entrees was good, typical nice restaurant good.   ...  ... Then the entrees came... ...  ... If you took an audio-only recording of our table, it could easily be mistaken for a 5 person porno.  We were all very impressed!  I ordered my steak MR and it was perfect.  The steak wasnt overly dressed, they let to quality of the meat do the most talking.  The asparagus was soft while still retaining the nice crispness you'd expect.  By the end of it, not only did we have a great steak, but we were full!!  I had abandoned the asparagus to ensure that I finished the steak even. ...  ... All in all, an absolutely flawless experience.  Server was perfect, charismatic, informative, attentive without being a nuisance.  We will definitely be back!

52	3	0	0	0	Good food, great drinks - enough said - it's Vegas - you can't expect me to remember all the details
52	3	0	0	0	I'm torn here.  I feel like I should give it a four or five star, but my gut is telling me 3 stars.  It's a beautiful restaurant.  We had a great table with a view of the Strip and the Bellagio fountains.  The waiter was truly awesome.  The menu was very interesting, with some great sounding appetizers, sides and entres.  I was there with my wife, my brother and his daughter, who was in town to celebrate her 21st birthday later that night.  So all the pieces were in place for a wonderful experience.  For some reason, the food did not live up to my expectations, and maybe that's on me.  We tried a variety of appetizers, steaks, sides and desserts. ... They were all equally good, just not great.
52	4	0	0	0	Very modern design steak house as if you're in a lounge... well it felt like a lounge. ...  ... Food was superb!!
52	4	0	0	0	Hit the jackpot in Vegas and decided to treat ourselves to a NICE meal....after researching our options, we chose BOA for the view....or so we thought.......the only true views are outside on the patio.  They were not seating on the patio that night.......so our view became the table across from us and that was not what I had in mind.......RATS! ...  ... However, the drinks are EVERYTHING......who would think that a drink with balsamic vinegar and pepper could be so fine!!!  The Crush was also exceptional......the drinks were the highlight of the meal...... ...  ... The tableside Caesar salad was exceptional......the presentation and the flavor was off the chain! ...  ... I ordered the lobster tail with baked potato and my son ordered the strip with asparagus.  It was good, VERY generous portions.......dessert was no longer an option.  I have never seen a potato as big as that!! ...  ... Our service was exceptional!!! Kelly and Jenna were attentive, knowledgable and a wonderful addition to our meal........ ...  ... Without the sensational views, I consider BOA best for a nice drink!!
52	4	1	2	2	Picked BOA out of the Restaurant Week options for steakhouses. It may have been the tasty food, the nice view of the strip, or just the fact that I had a great date ... but overall it was a good experience. We had the caesar salad (although not served table side), tuna tartare, and jumbo crab cake for appetizers. The crab cake won hands down. It was crispy on the outside, tender inside with a nice sauce that complimented it well. My bf got the prime filet medallions and while it wasn't bad, its not something I'd recommend. My pan seared Salmon however was delicious! Same as the crab cake,the seared crust was just so good. And the sides of whipped potatoes and snap pea risotto were okay. While our waiter was super friendly and attentive, the main course took a long while to come out. So we took our desserts to enjoy at home. The cheesecake was good but could use a little more graham crust. Chocolate donut holes were absolutely yummy!!!! I'm definitely interested in coming back and trying some stuff I saw on the menu at regular price. So good move participating in Restaurant Week, not only for a good cause but you've earned a patron.
52	4	0	1	0	My party of five dined at BOA on 9/17/11.  We read many reviews and decided to try this place since we all love steaks.  We were not disappointed in the food, but we could not rate it above CUT at the Palazzo or Stripsteak in Mandalay Bay.   ...  ... That night's off the menu appetizer were escargot and French onion soup.  We tried the escargot.  The dish came with toasted bread and it was very good.   ...  ... We ordered the bone-in ribeye, petite filet, and bone-in filet.  All came out perfectly cooked, but we expected nothing less from a fine establishment such as BOA.  I really like the side dishes-the chipotle lime corn was fantastic with just the right amount of heat and tartness. Asparagus dish was grilled nicely, not overcooked and dried out like some restaurants. The mac-n-cheese with truffle oil was excellent-much better than the one at CUT.  We also ordered the fries, but the ones at Stripsteak were by far better than these. ...  ... The wait staff was very experienced.  They were courteous, prompt, and polite, couldn't ask for more. ...  ... Overall, it was a good experience, but nothing screamed WOW for us.   ...  ... If I had to rate the three top steakhouses in Las Vegas, it would be Stripsteak, then CUT, then BOA.
52	5	0	0	0	Make sure that you are wearing your most comfortable heels. It is way far back hidden beneath the forum shops. The decor is very modern and the service was great. I really liked how they make your Caesar salad from scratch table side. The steaks were delicious as well.
52	5	0	1	1	Had an incredible meal yet again.   Somehow we always return to Boa when we are in Las Vegas for our one special dinner.  It is always reliable and we are NEVER the least bit disappointed.  Steaks done to perfection, BLT salad wonderful.  Husband and son loved the lobster potato although for me,  just too much with a steak dinner.  My only wish was that we would get the table I requested; one of the ones facing the strip.  Although this is the second time, I have to be fair as we did change our reservation to a 1/2 hour later and I am guessing the request was lost.  It was a perfect meal with impeccable service though,  to say the least!
52	2	0	1	0	I don't eat steak, but everyone else does.  I ordered the halibut ($33) and it was the tiniest piece of fish I'd ever seen.  It was like 3.5 in x 2 in.  No joke.  It was dry.  Blah.  Mashed potatoes ($9) came in a small bowl and that wasn't good either.  It was more dry and boring.  Truffle cheese fries ($12) were pitiful looking.  Barely tasted truffle, very little cheese on top, and the fries were like McDonald's.  Onion rings ($9) were okay.  Crab leg was okay.  The best thing were the prawns that came with my bf's steak.  Those were good.

Took good care of us, and hooked up the wifey when he saw her eyeing the fresh strawberries.  An Ace. ...  ... We ll be back to visit again.  Eventhough we didnt have dinner, we had to have the Goat Cheese Baklava......the bomb. Classy place.
52	5	0	0	1	All around classy and great place for the 8 of us to try a great steak house. ... Way on top of the Forum Shops, so you have to take quite a walk to get up to the restaurant, but it was a great experience. ...  ... Everyone ordered bone-in Ribeye and Sirloin, with (a la carte) mashed potatoes, asparagus, macaroni truffle, duck liver, calamari. Everything was delicious and cooked correctly, my steak tasted a bit burnt on the outside, but the waiter did warn me about doing my steak as medium well. So it's more like 4.5/5, but the ambiance is nice. I would say it's very modern but not as 'young' as some other steakhouses I've been to on the strip. About $100 per person. One of the best steakhouses I've ever been to.
52	4	0	0	0	Stopped by for lunch around 12:45, the place wasn't busy but the service was very slow at first. I kept running out of my iced tea (super easy to refill) for 6-7 minutes at a time, my starter salad took 20 minutes to come out, and I must say the chair backs were extremely uncomfortable; and it wasn't just me I noticed the lady at the table next to me rubbing her back as well. Now after the salad arrived I'm happy to say everything picked up dramatically. The salad I chose was the BOA BLT with bacon flavored dressing and it was amazing, and so was the bread that came with it, a perfect 10 combo. Followed by the fillet medallions which were spot in as well, they were perfectly cooked and well flavored with delicious mashed potatoes. ...  ... In summary: Aside from the slow service at first and the uncomfortable wooden backed chairs, I'd highly recommend BOA Steakhouse. The salad, sides, and fillet were excellent. and I look forward to trying their full steak menu for dinner!
52	5	0	0	0	I made it a point to try this place during restaurant week, and it excelled my expectations. I'm not a steak eater and I could probably count one hand how many times I've ordered steak. Let me tell you, my steak was cooked to perfection. And I would definitely order it again.  ...  ... I had the BOA fusion martini, actually i had two, and I could've had 4 more :) they were so good, and also the farmers market martini. The drinks were perfection, but dangerous, you don't even taste alcohol in them, and then it sneaks up on you. The service was outstanding, water glass was never empty, always checking with us. The ambiance was nice as well. Definitely would return.
52	4	1	2	1	Picture it, Forum Shops, Friday evening table for one. ...  ... When dining alone I love sitting at the bar and the guys at BOA are just another reason why. Super friendly service, great drinks and a steak that makes you want to slap your gramma! ...  ... Since my current alcoholic crush is on gin I sampled a few of their crafted cocktails made of the stuff, each drink went so well with everything -- I really wanted this meal to go on for days.  ...  ... I started with a wedge salad (hold the bacon), the lettuce was fresh and the dressing was super creamy, this was delicious! Next up the star of the show, a juicy delicious piece of boneless rib eye cooked to perfection! I don't think I have ever eaten so slowly.  ...  ... No way there's room for dessert you say, oh, but there was. Three chocolate cupcakes topped with torched marshmallow and served with fresh whipped cream. I pretty much went back to my hotel room and passed out after this meal, it was well worth the hefty price tag.  ...  ... Next time I'm in Vegas and looking for a piece of steak BOA will be a must re-visit.
52	5	0	0	1	Dinner with my wife and her girlfriends.  A classic steakhouse specializing in aged steaks.  My wife and I started at the bar with great drinks served by friendly and attentive staff while we waited for the rest of our party.  The seating area at the bar i a combo of bar stools and wrap around couches that create a very comfortable but upscale ambience.  We moved to our table and had a meal that was simply fabulous.  i had the porterhouse with asparagus.  The steak comes with a whole roast garlic clove garnished with a sage twig.  do yourself a favor and extract a couple of the cloves to eat with your steak --- DELICIOUS!  My steak was butter tender and the asparagus sprouts were huge and tender throughout.  Our waiter was attentive and engaging.  He advised on not only the dishes but the wine list and desserts.  We were celebrating two (2) birthdays and the waiter suggested we allow him to select a dessert sampler.  What a great choice!  He brought the sparklers and desserts.  They topped off a great evening.  Highly recommended.  I will definitely put this on my list every time I am in Vegas.
52	4	0	1	1	Calling all carnivores, you will not be disappointed! In fact you will be inclined to order more and more of whatever deliciousness has touched your lips once you've dined at BOA. Our waiter was genuinely excited about the menu and his recommendations.
52	5	0	1	1	I'd eaten at the BOA in Santa Monica a couple of years ago and wasn't impressed, so my expectations weren't high, but the Las Vegas location exceeded them in stellar fashion. The food and service were phenomenal.   ...  ... I started with the Caesar salad, which they make table side, and it was excellent.  ...  ... My main course was the petite filet mignon with blue cheese and Cabernet sauce -- one of the best steaks I've ever had.  ...  ... The truffle mac and cheese was outstanding -- I was sharing with friends, but I could have eaten the whole bowl myself. The bacon and cheddar mashed potatoes were also very good.   ...  ... For dessert, I had the chocolate chip cookies served with vanilla ice cream. The ice cream was good -- it had a really nice texture. The cookies looked and tasted like slice and bake. I was OK with that, because I actually like slice and bake cookies and they were good, though not what I expected.
52	5	0	1	1	There is a reason BOA Steakhouse is considered one of the top steakhouses in Las Vegas. They deliver a wonderful steak, excellent side dishes and attentive service. ...  ... My wife and I dined here the day after Thanksgiving 2011 and, not surprisingly, the restaurant was somewhat empty at 6:45pm (but it is also Vegas, so 6:45pm is more like lunch). ...  ... Atmosphere: ... Coming from the bright and noisy Caesar's Palace Forum Shops into the restaurant is a drastic change of scenery. The restaurant is very dark and surprisingly quiet. Patrons immediately see a large bar area and a giant wine chilling room stocked with bottles before reaching the main dining area in the back. Large windows provide a view of the neon world outside. ...  ... Appetizer: ... We started with the Steak Tartare and it was decadent. The raw steak is mixed at the table with 6 different herbs and a raw egg. It was one of the best Steak Tartares I have eaten. ...   ... Entree: ... I selected the Bone-in Kansas City Filet and I was very pleased with my choice. The medium rare filet was so tender, it was actually difficult to cut, but eating it was sensational. The marbling was rendered edible and not gristly at all...very nice! Melted herb butter topped off the succulent steak for an amazing taste and texture experience. Perfectly-prepared mashed potatoes with sour cream and chives rounded out the plate. ...  ... Drinks/Desserts: ... After consuming more than our share on Thanksgiving Day, we opted out of drinks and desserts, so I cannot comment there. However, friends tell me the mixed drinks at BOA are above average. ...  ... Service: ... The service was top notch. Our waiter was attentive, but not overbearing. The bus and water people came when needed and were quick. ...  ... Other: ... About the only thing resembling a complaint is the overly-cushy seats. They made the table a little higher than standard, but this was not a major issue. Prices were similar to Ruth's Chris & Morton's, but the quality food was much better. Kudos for being able to book on Open Table straight from my phone. ...  ... We will be back to BOA the next time we are in Las Vegas.
52	3	0	0	0	We had two apps and a steak for $92 with tax & tip. If the steak was $10 less, I would have given 4* but it was a bit expensive and service was only OK. I would recommend coming here for just apps as those were big and very good. My husband had the bacon tart (he said it was good) and I had the goat cheese baklava. For steak, we tried the rib eye with herbed butter.  Sadly, the sauce was a bit bland - more a dollop of herb butter on the center than a rub or sauce. The roasted garlic was my favorite thing on the plate. The steak was a bit fatty (expected) but the outside was also well done and the inside medium to medium rare. I like uniformity in my steak. So overall, while good, it wasn't great but if you want steak in Vegas, give this place a look.
52	3	0	0	0	I've been here a bunch of times, and it's always a good meal.  The steaks are good, served to the temperature you ask, and the tableside Caesar salad is amazing!  Luckily, though, I always go on the company dime, since this place is so expensive!  Of course, it's Vegas...it's a steakhouse, but boy it seems expensive.   ...  ... That being said, I've always had fun there, always enjoyed the food, so I'd say it's a good choice...if you're not paying. ...  ... Definitely get the Caesar salad.  They make it tableside whether one person orders it or the whole table.  It's fun to see and they make it spicy with some red pepper and hot sauce.  It's amazing to see how much damn oil and cheese goes into it, but also fun.  The result is always delicious!  I also like the jumbo shrimp appetizer...but it's like $20 for 3 shrimp!  Like I said, pricey. I think the cheapest steak is $40..up to $50.  I like the bone-in Kansas City Filet.  The bone adds flavor, and it's better than the Petite Filet...in my opinion.   ...  ... This place is a good, solid steakhouse with a modern flair.  They serve yummy fancy drinks, too...and the wine list is extensive.
52	4	0	0	0	gorgeous interior design, patio overlooking the strip, friendly bar staff and AMAZING food. A+ for table side, prime steak tartare ! They mix the fine cut prime with fresh ingredients right at your table. don't miss the lump ble crab cocktail either! Nom nom nom for sure!
52	1	1	2	1	Boa Steakhouse, located at the top of The Forum Shops at Caesars Palace, is a beautiful & hip place to be on the Las Vegas Strip, especially for NEW YEARS EVE getting ready to ring in 2012.  That being said, the serving of our "Porterhouse for  2" didn't quite meet the glitter & glammar that is Las Vegas.  Coming from Southern California, most of the finer, gourmet steak houses (etc Ruth Chris, Arroyo Chop House, Mortons, Maestros.....even Boa, Santa Monica) will serve your Porterhouse for 2 at the table, dividing both the strip steak & fillet equally where both individuals have pieces from each side, respectively.  Boa Las Vegas divides their Porterhouse for 2 in the kitchen, and is brought to the table where 1 person gets all of the strip steak while the other person gets all of the fillet side.....UNBELIEVABLE being served in this style at such a well established steakhouse.  When asking the waiter about this, he said that "HE usually will divide the Porterhouse at the table BUT, he could bring it back to the kitchen to divide it properly, should I wish!"  I said sure AND upon bringing back our Porterhouse for 2, the whole strip steak portion was cut to pieces and served to my wife while the whole fillet portion was also cut to pieces and served to me.......WOW.  The look by the waiter was suggestive of "I don't know what's wrong with you.....don't know how to cut steak or what?"  My sister who had suggested Boa Steakhouse for our New Years Eve rendezvous was embarrassed & appalled in the way my wife & I were served.  Next, they'll probably say there was a new chef in the kitchen for New Years Eve that didn't know what he/she was doing.  This makes me apprehensive to come back for a second chance at this restaurant  because this should have been one of the best dining experiences of my life in Las Vegas.
52	5	0	7	3	Hey everyone... For the last 6.5 years, I've been the General Manager at Boa LV. I'm very proud of the overwhelmingly positive reviews we've had over the years. And the negative ones... well, they've kept us honest and given us the chance to improve.   ...  ... For those of you that don't know, this Friday, Jan 27th, will be our last night of business. After 7.5 years we will be closing our doors at Caesars in Las Vegas. We are all very sad, but don't worry, our sister restaurant Sushi Roku, will remain open, and we have plans to reopen a new Boa in Las Vegas in the near future. Thank you to all of our loyal supporters, our great employees, and to those of you who can't come to Vegas without enjoying a Boa 405. It's been such a fun experience. Please, come see us at Boa in Hollywood and Boa in Santa Monica, and if you're in Vegas and really need a 405, come to Sushi Roku; we'll hook you up! Thanks for everything!
52	5	0	0	0	One of the best steaks ever. Very knowledgeable staff that pairs wine well with the meal, steaks are prepared to precise tastes. I have tried multiple steakhouses and so far BOA is the only place that can get a medium rare filet mignon blackened with pepper crust right.  ...  ... The price is high, but if $$$ is not a concern for a special occasion it's highly recommended.  ...  ... Great ambiance and if you make reservations ask for the patio seating overlooking the strip.

52	4	0	0	0	I am not sure why this is listed as closed because the website for Las Vegas still shows it alive and well. I was in Vegas for a convention and had dinner here. though Caesers may have lots its glitter as a premium Vegas hotel this restaurant has not. It is as good as ever. The steaks as well as the sides were all first class as was the service. It is clear that the clientele is well healed and accustomed to the best of the best and this place delivers. If I could give it 4.5 stars I would its that good.

Now, where am I supposed to get my steak on in Vegas? SW steakhouse? .......
54	5	0	3	0	I would highly (highly, highly) recommend T Brothers Tile. ...  ... We found T Brothers through servicemagic.com. After reading horrible reviews about Service Magic, and not being able to find any reviews about T Brothers online, we had some reservations. Mark at T Brothers eased our worries, though. He gave us a great deal on tile installation (cheapest we found in town) as he was completely willing to negotiate closer to what we had budgeted without complaints. ...  ... T Brothers also sells tile, which worked out to our benefit as they had a great selection at discounted rates from the vendor. Our entire job (installation and tile) cost us less than we had anticipated and was done better than we had expected. ...  ... The two contractors that came to our house were hard-working, kind and definitely experienced. They laid out the tile dry and carefully made sure the layout would work for our floor plan. They took their time doing the install and especially did an amazing job with corners and cuts. They cleaned up after themselves after the installation was complete, and kept a clean working area during the install. ...  ... I have absolutely nothing bad to say about T Brothers Tile and I cannot recommend this company enough! Before you buy tile or installation elsewhere, check with T Brothers because I'm sure they can give you better quality product and installation in half the price. Go now! What are you waiting for? :)
54	1	0	3	2	I was referred to them via Lumber Liquidators.  They came out to do an estimate for laminate flooring in my house.  They came out on a Tuesday and said I would have the estimate by Thursday of that week.  When Friday came and I did not have an estimate I called them to inquire.  They explained that there was a glitch in their system and some emails were not going out.  They explained that nobody was in the office to resend, so I would get it first thing on Monday.  On Monday I STILL did not receive the estimate, so I called AGAIN and they told me I would have it by the end of the day.  Now it is Tuesday (a full week later), and I still have no estimate, even after calling twice about it.  Since this company can't even seem to get me a simple estimate, I have NO confidence that they would be able to complete the work in an efficient and professional manner.
54	5	0	1	0	We have done over 20 projects with T-Brothers tile in the past two years.  They have installed carpet, wood and tile floors for us throughout the valley from small apartments to multimillion dollar residences. ... They definitely deserve your consideration on your next flooring project. ... Axiom Construction & Management
54	5	0	0	0	I was just searching lumber liquidators and I came across Tbrothers rating's they were the company that installed our granite in the kitchen they did a great job it was years ago. They broke my garden window during install it was replace for me in days. I would recommend them.they were on time,priced well and they did a good job.
54	5	1	4	1	We had carpet removed and hardwood floors installed in less than 8 hours by these guys. It looks beautiful!  ...  ... The customer service was spot on. The team is just that--people working together quickly and efficiently to get the job done. No problems in the floor--it's a smooth finish with no knicks or wobbly floorboards.  ...  ... Definitely would recommend to anybody needing this type of work done!
54	1	0	1	1	READ THIS ENTIRE REVIEW!!!!! I can help you decide about Tbros. STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY horrible work and never calls you back  shows up when they want to, not to mention supervisor told worker to do work a certain way- per my instructions- and the worker did what he wanted to do. Had them rip it out and do it again and they charged me for it. the supervisor told his boss what happened but they charged me any way. I called and called to resolve the issue but the supervisor would not return my calls but every time I called the next day I was e mailed the same bill I disputed all along, they would not even speak to me. I was never nasty mind you I was very polite every time and positive about the issue. PLEASE,PLEASE,PLEASE, if you are thinking about using this company DON"T. Resist the temptation to use them  no matter how cheap they might be. Try someone else if you do not know who to use.  Please DO go to their website and look at the first picture of the shower, where the glass meets the tile on the right there is a wall  tile so far out of plane with the others that you can set a glass on it. this picture accurately represents what you will get from this company when you hire them, and I do mean in every way shape and form you can think of. If value and quality are a priority for you do not use Tbros tile. If you decide to use them after reading this review you have my full sympathy.
54	5	1	0	0	We recently sold our house and I still joke that I wish we could have taken those tile floors with us. My dad, who was in construction himself for 20+ years, frequently called it the best tile job he had ever seen. Me too. ...  ... Great work T Brothers. Seriously! 4.5 years later and I am still bragging about this tile job. Now my big question is, how much will they charge for food, travel and lodging to install new tile for me now 1300 miles away?
54	5	0	0	0	I have had T Brothers Tile do two jobs for me in the past 2 years. First they laid hardwood floors and granite counters in my guest house. They did such an excellent job for a good price, when I needed new tile in my bathroom, they were the first ones I called. They did the job wonderfully, quickly and reasonably. All of my flooring, tile, and countertop business will be with them and I recommend them highly.
54	1	0	0	0	This week, T brothers came out to install wood floors in my entryway , living and dinning room. I bought my wood through Lumber Liquidators and this is the company they sent to do the job. The crew came in and the living room and dinning room went smoothly. The entryway, however, has been a disaster. I did the prep work myself and had concerns because I could not get it even. I informed the company of this and was assured that the installers would smooth and make sure it was level. Well, they did not. They didn't check , level or do a dry run with the wood before applying the glue hoping just to get it done. It was a total disaster The wood was taken up, cut and reset  several times, with the glue on it trying to get it straight. By 9 in the evening I was asking them to leave because noting was going right. They came back out the next day to do finishing touches and clean the mess up. They took glue removed and rubbed down my entire floors, which left a film visible the next morning. The boss, Bill, called me the next day to address my concerns. When I tried to tell him, he was rude and disrespectful talking over me while defending his worker. I had to ask him to be professional and stop talking for a minute and listen to me, the customer, which he finally did. He continued to defend his worker and tried to tell me the glue remover had mineral spirits in it so it was OK to use all over my floor. I just shook my head and could see where this was going. He send another worker to fix my concerns and I have to say, it was like night and day. This worker has had to remove half of of entryway so far just to get it level enough to install the baseboards. Even he couldn't believe what the other guy did and indicated he has this problem all the time. He said his work is always sloppy and he should really be doing something else. I do not recommend this company for a couple of reasons. First, because of the rudeness of the owner in defending the installers work. Second, for continuing to keep a bad apple knowing there are problems with his work. Perhaps, he is paying him next to nothing. I don't know. I paid good money for my floors and to have PROFESSIONALS install it. It is a shame the the second guy wasn't sent to do the job in the first place. I am sure my rating would be tops!!! ...       .
54	5	0	0	0	Haven't had a ton of experience with carpeting but Bill and his team made our experience very enjoyable.  I really felt like they cared about my situation and what would be best for me and my home.  My wife loved their customer service as well. A+ service and it didn't break the bank.
55	4	0	2	1	This location just opened up a few days ago.  I have read some of the other reviews for other locations and agree for the most part.  Normally, I would make the trip to Trader Joes, but was pleased to see a Fresh & Easy opening a little closer to home.  They had a decent selection of pre-made sandwiches, and sushi, and pasta dishes, but I have to say I am more impressed by what Trader Joes has to offer.  I was very impressed with their produce however.  They had a great selection, and everything looked really appetizing.  I am not sure if it will be a regular occurrence or if it was just because they recently opened, but they has some people walking around with samples.  I tried the kettle chips and they were tasty.  They have a decent wine selection, and they seemed reasonably priced.  Today I got a nigiri sushi tray (which was not all that great), trail mix (yummy), a fresh fruit salad(very good), and a pasta dish (which I haven't tried), and some random snacks.  I was only going to give 3 stars, but I added a star for the really personable staff.  All of the lanes are self check out, but I got help without asking, and she even bagged my groceries. When I left, there was someone at the door who gave me a free reusable shopping tote (kinda flimsy, not as nice as the ones you pay for, but hey, it was free!) and a bunch of coupons.  As long as comparisons are being made, I have to say I like Trader Joes better, but I will probably go back for convenience and the friendly staff. ...  ... I have gone back since my last review, and I have to say I become more impressed each time.  I really liked the Thai Style Green Curry Chicken.  I am also a huge fan of their frozen molten lava cakes...mmm.  Finally, I have decided that I am hugely impressed by the collapsible utensils found in their ready to go meals!!
55	5	2	2	3	Fresh and Easy is the Target to Vons' Wal Mart.  These little grocery stores are popping up everywhere in the valley.  They've got lots of good packaged stuff that even a clumsy Cro Magnon guy like myself can manage to cook up, and by that I'm talking about the microwave and the toaster oven, baby yeah.  You want that in for 2 minutes or 3?
55	5	0	1	1	Molten Lava Cake... Low Sodium Black Beans...  Blue Berry Muffins... And the freshness  of the produce.  These small stores are amazing.   ...  ... I sampled the Stash's Premium Lemon Ginger Caffeine Free Herbal Tea, several months ago and purchased three packages, but seem to no longer be one of their choices.   Used the last tea bag yesterday and am looking for another supplier in the valley, anyone know where it might be acquired? ...  ... The coffee samples offered in the morning are good, I have tried a few different blends...  The fresh basil plants are good and i have repotted several and they look health and i believe i will reap the benefit of purchasing a live plant in the near future... ...  ... If you have not tried one of these great little stores, you are missing a good bargain, and fresh produce... ...  ... JR
55	4	1	2	1	Yay! I'm definitely a fan of Fresh & Easy, basically because of its eponymous qualities.  These stores are just so damn convenient and fast.  They are located in almost every neighborhood, and more are being built all the time.   ...  ... They have most of the stuff you generally need to function, but with limited choices so that you're not overwhelmed (e.g., 30 kinds of cereal instead of 300).  Lots of good house brands too!  They have a lot of premade food: dinners, sandwiches, salads. ...  ... Great VEGAN options: some organic fresh fruits and veggies (usually organic salad greens, spinach, carrots, herbs, bananas).  Fair trade/organic coffee, 3 types of soy milk + soy creamer, tofu, Gardein brand faux meat products (found in the veggie aisle), vegan chocolate, soy ice cream, Tofutti cuties, and Purely Decadent chocolate-covered coconut ice cream pops.  Even some of their pre-made food is vegan!   They have even started selling some eco-friendly beauty supplies as of late.   ...  ... Other good stuff - it's all self check-out, and I've never been there when there was a line more than one person deep (I got at least once a week). They also have weekly coupons and specials.
55	3	0	0	0	I love the store.. some prices is fair and some is good.
55	4	0	1	1	I adore Fresh & Easy. I just can't get enough of this place. I am determined to try every one of their pre-packaged scrumptious meals. Today I had the pesto salad with mozzarella and big juicy tomatoes. And tomorrow I'm going to have the shrimp, spinach, and tomato pasta I picked up on Sunday. Also - I'll be enjoying one of their addicting soups (french onion) later this week. ...  ... F&E at this location has always served me well. I love the ability to waltz into a small establishment, grab exactly what I want, and with ease, self-check my way out. Now that is how I want to do my grocery shopping! Believe me, I'm a fan of Whole Foods/Trade Joe's as well, but F&E takes that same feel and makes it more intimate. True, there is less selection (you're not going to find fresh fish here), but for the run-o-the-mill grocery store run it is perfect! ...  ... I think F&E also feeds a perfect niche of people (single professionals who don't want to eat garbage).  ...  ... My only complaint with F&E is that on a few occasions I have noticed some of the produce has looked pretty beaten up and bruised. Other than that, F&E is the perfect convenient place to stock up for a week for a busy-body professional.
55	4	0	0	0	Since the other two locations near my home closed (charleston/eastern & di/pecos), this is the closest store now.  ...  ... While on a quick Best Buy stop on a saturday night (a few weekends ago), my MIL and I went in for a quick peek before returning to her home. We only made it to the first few aisles (produce, meat, cheese, markdowns) but I was able to get a bunch of what I needed: tangerines, romaine lettuce, 2 kinds of mushrooms, zucchini, fresh & easy brand mozzarella cheese, and 2 packages of fresh & easy brand sausage, for $16.00. I was happy. Overall, the store is clean, what we saw, anyway. There were many people shopping that night. My MIL said she should stop by here and shop more often.  ...  ... Self- checkout was speedy (I know the drill). Carts were outside, in front. The parking lot is pretty ample. Should  stop here whenever we go to dinner at my MIL's house, since it's in the area. Dependable chain for good food (ever since the cellulose story on the Mark & Mercedes was reported, I've been reading labels like a fiend).
55	4	0	0	0	MEAT.. This is one of my favorite place to buy all sorts of meats and other grocerie needs. I love to BBQ and their meats are always the freshest. I guess that's how they got their name. They have great deals that change from week to week. They may not have all off the items a big store has but they do have a much better quality.
55	1	2	2	1	All I can say is "Bad"... Horrible Customer Service and they don't keep up w/ the produce... Come on 5 days past due and there is mold
55	5	0	0	0	It's time for me to get back on track. 2010 was a good year for me. I made a huge effort to eat better and exercise. It went pretty good and became part of a daily routine. 2011 I got off track haven't recovered strongly. I still work out on and off but have yet to develop a routine out of it.  ...  ... For me it starts with snacks. So, this is my first step in that direction. I even walked over here how about that?  ...  ... The store always feels clean when I enter and the cool breeze when the doors open feels good. I started at the fruit section. Right away I noticed their strawberries are buy 1 get 1 free and I like strawberries. I couldn't resist a cantaloupe either. Next I proceeded to the veggies. I recalled a thread mentioning that carrots and cucumbers were legit so those were added next to my cart. It was hard to pass the frozen pizzas, pre-made meals, and beer but I was successful. Next I found myself starring at dry goods, granola bars in such. I settled with some organic raw almonds. To drink I grabbed a couple gallons of water.  ...  ... I felt like I made some good decisions to get me through the week with snacks. Next week I'll be back to try a few more things and more strawberries before the sale ends (4/18 to 4/25). Any suggestions would be awesome as well!
55	4	0	1	0	I feel kind of weird writing a review of a place that I go to for necessity.   ...  ... This place is pretty small but they are pretty organized.  I buy most of my meat's from Fresh & Easy because of the deals they have.  I mean, packages of 6 chicken legs for less than 5 dollars.  Come on!  That's a great deal.  They also have a pretty decent selection on ethnic foods & spices.  And, if organic is your thing, and you don't live near a Trader Joe's or similar, then this is a must hit.   ...  ... And, if you want something quick and easy, you can pick up some pre-made meals that are good and cheap.  But, my must have, and the real reason that I come here, is for the Organic Coconut Oil.  It is $8 and a staple in my diet.   ...  ... Don't trust the map on Yelp for this place. It's near the corner of D.I. & Nellis.  Not on Sandhill & Viking.
55	4	0	2	0	I like fresh and easy market and I'm lucky that it is the primary market in the area. I got in and out quickly. Today was the first time I've been there in a while, but their salads still look fresh. Also, the girls who helped bag the groceries were on their a game!
56	3	1	1	1	A group of us came here because we needed to get our drink on before standing in line to get into Pure nightclub. The waitresses were pretty attentive and the bartender got our drinks out in a timely manner. The staff did not mind that we moved the chairs around to accommodate our fairly large group of 10. You do get a view of the Pussycat Dolls party pit gambling area and there is a big fish tank in the middle of the lounge area. Other than that, I think this is a good pit stop to get your drink on before heading anywhere around Caesar's Palace.
56	4	1	1	1	Yes, it is just a casino bar, but it's actually a pretty nice one.  The seats are super comfortable, the bartenders are pretty friendly and attentive, and they have 25c video poker at the bar.  Great place to meet friends and grab a drink, especially if you're heading to Pure.
56	3	2	2	2	A pretty nice lounge inside of Caesar's.  For this past trip to Vegas, since I was over at the Palms, and my friend was over at Flamingo, we used this bar as a central meeting place, and where a majority of my video poker playing was done. ...  ... We have been to this place before many times in the past because it is in a fairly central location, and if we have a larger group, there are tables in a spacious area to relax in. ...  ... The drinks are expensive, but it's also a pretty nice area with a lot of people-watching ambiance to it... :D ...  ... The 3 stars are because my friend and I were sitting at the bar playing video poker, and with our experiences at other bars, when you're about 3/4 of the way done with a drink, the bartenders will usually come up to you and ask if you need another drink, or in some cases, just give you the same drink again without asking.  At Seahorse, no matter what time of day we go, whether they are busy or not, we had to seriously flag down a bartender to get us another drink.  Maybe it's a rule of the bar to ignore keeping the drinkers of comped drinks happy...
56	4	1	1	1	I love a casino bar. There's something about sitting down for a drink (or five) in a place that has its own unique decor and personality while still hearing, seeing, and feeling the excitement of the casino just beyond your table.  ...  ... The Seahorse is my favorite one of these. It certainly has its own unique decor and personality: a huge and beautiful tank filled with an array of seahorses; an ornate carving of an ecstatic-looking mermaid with huge and beautiful breasts (I've noticed that all of Cesar's female statues seem to have gone to the same plastic surgeon); cozy tables and couches spread around into different nooks throughout the bar.  ...  ... Of course you can play video poker and get your drinks comped (in my experience the bartenders are friendly, chatty, and generous with the drinks), but you can also order, relax, pay standard Vegas prices for drinks, and take it all in.  ...  ... On one visit, when I had opted for the latter of these options, I ordered a drink called the Poseidon (which was, as I recall, a gin martini with a dash of dash of Cointreau). The bartender served me the drink in a huge and beautiful martini glass and then gave me the shaker with the leftover concoction. Suffice it to say that I was pretty relaxed when we headed over to Mesa Grill for our dinner reservations. That warm and fuzzy feeling has hung on and I love the Seahorse to this day!
56	4	0	1	0	Probably an unknown hidden gem in my opinion.  This lounge is situated right before the Pussycat Dolls Casino and Pure, so it made for some great people watching from their cozy furniture.  Their drinks are kinda pricey but that's nothing new since you're on the Strip.  The waitresses here are very nice though and I've managed to make a few friends out of them since I frequent here every time I fly back to Vegas.  Definitely check it out and give it chance if not to drink, but to just chill out and take a break from the hustle and bustle of the Strip.
56	4	0	3	0	My friends and I stopped by this lounge to watch a football game on Saturday. ...  ... Bucket of Bud Light (5 16 oz.): $25 ... Pitcher of margarita: $35 ... Service: 4/5 ... Ambience: 3.5/5 - The decor is nice, but they really need to replace the TV projectors which don't complement a lounge of this caliber.
56	4	1	1	1	Really comfy chairs to kick back in with a cocktail and people watch. ...  ... Limited bar - we asked for different flavored vodkas and they kept saying "not at this bar but at the other bar".  We never figured out what the other bar is. ...  ... Interesting holograms of fish on the walls. ...  ... No TV when we were there.  Supposedly also there is a light menu but didn't see that either.
56	5	7	4	3	This is not a five star review because this is the best hotspot in Vegas.  Nor is it a five star review because the Seahorse Lounge is so lush, plush, or otherwise updated.   ... Nay, this is not that five star review.   ...  ... I'm giving the Seahorse Lounge 5 starts because of the following: ... - they always seem to have an available table and a few extra chairs around ... - they have Hendricks for my G&Ts (tho last Vegas trip we drank so much of it that they may *still* be restocking) ... - the waitresses have some of the worst costumes in all of Vegas (think midwestern high school's production of The Little Mermaid) ... - it's quieter than other bars in Vegas so you have half a prayer of having a conversation (if that's your thing) ... - GIANT FISH TANK ... - Open late (or early, depending on your perspective)
56	4	1	1	1	This is such a great Caesar's spot.  It seems to be slower to fill up than other locations on the property.  Sure, they don't have the "shadow" dancers as a draw, nor do they have a giant Cleopatra dangling her cleavage over your head as you walk by, but Seahorse directly overlooks the whole Pussycat Doll casino area at Caesar's.  That portion of the casino opens later in the evening, but if you secure your location at Seahorse early, you've got a front row seat to awesome.  And that front row seat, by the way, is crazy comfy and plush.
56	3	0	1	0	If I am hankering for a non-free drink and am in Caesar's and don't want to patronize a restaurant bar, this is where I go. It's very open and provides a good viewing of the casino floor. And there's all the pretty fish in the fish tank columns. And that's the draw. Otherwise, it's a middle-of-the-road casino bar. No specialty cocktails, no great beer. They do have one of my preferred sparking wines, though.
56	2	0	0	0	OK, so I read a review that said "quiet" and thought, my kind of place. ...  ... Quiet? Not so much. Maybe it was quiet before the Pussycat Dolls tables moved in just outside the perimeter - I'm searching, here, people. It was ear-splitting noise. Deafening. Not at all intimate.  ...  ... On the plus side, it gave me an excuse to change tables to one of the comfy couch-type things so I could hear my fiance say sweet things to me while we snuggled close. And the Lemon Drop was fabulous. (For $15 plus, it should be.) ...  ... And it was blue and green. I like blue and green
56	1	0	0	0	This used to be our go-to Vegas hang out bar; great location, open to the fun casino with comfy chairs, and pitchers of drinks for $75-$85 each, which, once you pour that into 6 drinks or so, isn't a bad Vegas deal.  But now they took away the pitchers and are just like every other bar in Vegas with $18 drinks.  Go back to the pitchers, Seahorse!
56	5	3	2	3	Chic chic boutique lounge with plush comfortable seating, strong cocktails and great service. ...  ... The architectural design is gorgeous, complete with a massive 1700-gallon aquarium, imposing Roman columns, beautiful seahhorse and mermaid statues and plush leather armchairs.  The blend of Roman architechture, modern touches and ocean inspiration is very relaxing and peaceful. ...  ...  We enjoyed a few spicy bloody Marys and cocktails before our lunch over at Mesa Grill. My boyfriend caught some football action and played some blackjack on one of their electronic machines.  ...  ... Wonderful relaxing lounge in Ceasar's Palace. A great place to put your feet up after some rigorous shopping :-)
56	3	0	0	0	This was only my second trip to the strip and my 1st time to Caesar's Palace. I had signed up for a casino rewards plan our last night there. Yes, it was free but I still felt like I needed to use up as many of the coupons as I could. They expired 12/31/11 and we were there in November.  ...  ... It was nice weather not hot or cold so I was dressed in my Dress-comfy-buffet-eating pants but had a tough time getting the waitresses attention. In here defense she was busy helping all the men in their expensive suites. I hope they tipped her well. I went to the bar and got my 2 drinks with my coupon and out the door I went.
56	4	0	0	0	Caesar's Palace is probably one of the second largest casinos in Las Vegas and sometimes you need to take a load off while walking through the winding casino floor.  I stopped by this lounge on a quiet Friday afternoon. ...  ... I found the Seahorse Lounge a great place to chill and have quick drink on my way out to the strip.  I play the video machines usually when I enter a bar like this.  The BJ games don't have double-down or split.  I occasionally got 2-Aces and couldn't do anything with them but HIT.  Bummer.    ...  ... Definitely overpriced if you are not gambling, but this is the STRIP.  Boom!
56	5	0	0	0	Beautiful lounge that has a huge fish tank in the middle of the entrance! I love that this place is laid back and the service is amazing. I'm giving this place 5 stars because our server was so sweet for giving us an extra discount on our drinks. Saved us a lot of money because drinks here are EXPENSIVE!! But hey, its vegas so what do you expect? But if you can save a bit of money on drinks then why not take advantage of it? I'm definitely returning back here on my next trip to Las Vegas :)
56	3	2	2	2	It's as secluded a bar you'll find at a major casino.  The bar is elevated and located behind rows of slot machines.  There isn't a casino entrance in sight, and most people probably wouldn't even notice it. ...  ... The seating is a little dated, but I think that's intended.  The huge single chairs are supremely comfortable and you can definitely exceed your pregame schedule by an hour so in this environment.  The people watching isn't that great however.  Caesar's Palace isn't a glamor spot any more, those days are long gone.  But you can still have a decent time at Seahorse Lounge. ...  ... "Caesar's Palace is probably one of the second largest casinos in Las Vegas..." ...  ... Wait...what...
56	4	0	1	0	Need a rest from gambling or need to rest your feet from the walking this is the place to go. The service here is great as long as you can find a place to sit or at the bar. I came here with a group of 9 people and there was plenty of room. We were lucky enough to find a place in the sofa area so we can just chill. Drinks are pricy here especially their special cocktails for $14. I would not come here to get wasted, this is just a place to come to when your already feeling tipsy and just need to rest your liver a bit before restarting again.
56	5	0	3	0	5 stars for this casino bar because: ...  ... * I loved the champagne cocktails.  While on the pricey side (upwards of $15), this is sort of par for the course in Las Vegas...and they were so tasty!  They are all made with fresh pureed fruit, and come with a straw for extra sipping fun; I enjoyed the grapefruit-based one in particular.  Of course, they also have a full bar. ...  ... * Great ambiance.  The bar is located within Caesar's Palace, elevated a bit from the gaming floor and delineated by a half-wall that allows you to watch the gamblers and passerby.  The decor is defined by the giant cylindrical fish tank in the center of the bar, which lends a peaceful air to the place despite the business of the surrounds.  The chairs are large and comfy, and conversation is possible despite a medium level of background noise.   ...  ... * Staff is attentive, courteous, and attired in funny little white dresses. ...  ... My husband and I hung out here for a very pleasant couple of hours, honing our blackjack skills.  I would definitely go back!
56	3	7	8	6	I've taken more than my fair share of drunken strolls through Caesars in Vegas and this place always catches my eye and makes me feel even more intoxicated. The Seahorse Lounge? Really? Was I drinking absinthe tonight??? ...  ... Sometimes I can't help but go order a drink, I'm like a drunken moth mystified by the alluring draw of the cheesy flame. ...  ... The drinks are expensive and the place is always empty, except for the occasional straggler hooker looking for easy prey, but there is not enough Seahorse juice in the world for me to fall victim. I just grab my gin and tonic and continue my journey into the Vegas night.
56	5	0	1	0	My boyfriend and i came here last Saturday, where the entire strip was packed..after hoofing it for about twenty minutes, we found ourselves wanting to find a good drink and a place to park for a moment. We ended up at Caesar's Palace and the huge fish tanks in the center of the lounge immediately drew us into the area. We sat at the bar, had a bartender named Mike come up to us (total Andrew Zimmerman look-alike). My boyfriend ordered a Mojito, I asked for a sweet, vodka based drink that had absolutely NO SYRUP in it! I had walked around the previous night with one of those towering frozen drinks in a souvenir cup that resulted in me ending my night with the spins. A small price to pay to the Vegas Gods, its not like you can do Vegas without getting a 3 foot Pina Colada, but that night I had a taste for something good and enjoyable. We had done our marathon drinking at the pool earlier, so at this point we something strong, yet delicious and enjoyable. Well Mike did NOT disappoint, my boyfriends Mojito was one of the best I ever had, and my drink was fantastic! Mike delivered exactly what I was looking for, which ended up being an infusion of raspberry and orange vodka, sweet and sour, and cranberry juice. The drinks ended up costing about $14 each, very fair for Vegas standards, and the size was great for the price. The atmosphere made you feel like you were definitely in the middle of the action, while at the same time the intimacy and space of the lounge is probably the best in comparison to many other casino bars. Drinks were strong, yet tasty and enjoyable, everything I could ask for from my bartender! Although Vegas is the place for yard long frozen margaritas and marathon drinking, when you are looking for a nice, upscale lounge with no dress code, high quality bartenders, and premium spirits at a reasonable price, this place is a MUST!
56	4	1	3	5	Mal (abends) in Vegas richtig abhngen? Und sich dabei unterhalten knnen, ohne ohrenbetubende Gerusche um einen herum? Ab in die Seahorse Lounge im Caesars Palace. ...  ... Ein Besuch zum Entspannen ist den ganzen Tag und die ganze Nacht ber mglich. Leicht erhht liegt die Lounge direkt neben einem Teil des Casinos. Die bequemen Sessel und Tische sind rund um eine Wassersule platziert, die 1.700 gallons Wasser enthlt. Und darin schwimmen nicht nur australische Belly Seepferdchen, nach denen die Lounge benannt ist, sondern auch eine Vielzahl anderer Meerestiere und Fische, die die australische Kste bevlkern. Da dieses Aquarium in der Mitte der Lounge liegt, ist freier Blick von allen Pltzen garantiert. ...  ... Die Damen, die bedienen, sind leicht geschrzt, weie (sehr) kurze Rcke und ebenso weie Corsage. Aber modisch so gar nicht trendig. ...  ... In der Lounge werden Getrnke aller Art angeboten, vom erfrischenden Kaffee am Morgen bis zu einer Vielzahl an Cocktails. Das Besondere sind jedoch die ber 20 Champagnersorten, die in 1/2-Flaschen angeboten werden. Nun gut, wir haben sie nicht probiert, uns reichten beim letzten Besuch ein G&T und ein Tanqueray Cocktail (je $ 11,50+). ...  ... Wer nach 22 h die Lounge besucht, wird Betrachter eines besonderen Spektakels. Hinter den Casino-Spieltischen in diesem Bereich rkelns sich leicht geschrzte Damen nach heier Musik in einer Art Kfig an langen Stangen. Klar, dass dann bei den Spieler die Jetons lockerer sitzen, wo doch zustzlich die Spielleiter an den Tischen dann alles Damen sind, die ebenso in reizender Uniform ihren Dienst versehen. ...  ... Ich war jetzt zwei mal dort (Nov. 12 und April 13), habe mich wohl gefhlt und kann die Bar empfehlen.
56	5	0	0	0	Situated just across from the Collisium entrance inside Caesars you find this intimate little lounge.... ... We found it to be the perfect meeting place at the end of the day for a champagne cocktail or simple cup of coffee... ... Lovely, attentive servers take good care of you...the decor is tasteful and high end..and the centerpiece of the lounge is a fantastic aquarium that we stared at for hours... ... I liked also that children arent allowed..its a nice quiet environment for chatting or people watching...we'll be back again.... and again!
56	4	2	2	4	I had never been here prior to this past weekend but I'm glad we stopped by! The bartenders here are super friendly and even gave me the extra leftovers from the martini we ordered! It wasn't super busy and the lounge area is super comfortable and spacious. If you are into marine life, they also have a cute aquarium at the entrance with giant statues of seahorses and seaweed.
56	4	0	0	0	Cute place for a drink before a show at the coliseum! They have a full menu of delicious Champagne drinks. The aquarium with the Seahorses is must see, with your drink, of course! Love the attractive giant mermaid behind the bar....
56	2	0	0	0	Weird vibe here. The drinks were overly priced (e.g., $27 for a Grey Goose & Cran), but strong. The seahorses are cute, but not like a main draw. There are so many other amazing places to grab drinks that have much better atmospheres...why stop here?
56	3	0	0	0	Met here with some friends on a weeknight, because the bar we wanted was having some renovations done. The bar is a small area, and adequate for small groups only, but the aquarium is a nice touch. Again, small groups only.  ...  ... Drinks are good - I recommend the Godiva martini or a cosmopolitan. The drinks are mixed well, and taste good. However, beware the sticker shock! I paid nearly $40 for two martinis. They were strong, but woah!  ...  ... The waitstaff and bartenders were nice and professional. Overall the bar isn't bad, it's just really expensive. I understand it's Vegas, but only go here if you win a jackpot.
56	3	0	0	0	Aquarium is great and yes, there are seahorses! Noisy, but that's expected because it is located in the casino.
57	5	0	2	1	Kara is very professional and her Brazilian waxing is truly painless! Her success is also inspired me to open my own business, thank you Kara and good luck!
57	5	0	2	1	I moved to Scottsdale in Jan. and tried a few places before LUCKILY coming across Kara!!! I have worked in the spa industry for the past 10 years and she is the best person I have ever been to for waxing. I had the worst experience ever at MOZAIK and would never recommend anyone to go there. Not only was my wax completely botched and left me with peeled off skin everywhere, I had to follow up with my complaint with the owner twice who made me feel like I had done something wrong.  ... Not only is Kara professional she also keeps a clean environment, and is extremely knowledgeable. Her technique is painless and super clean( she gets every hair). Do not try other people Kara is your girl for facials and waxing! A+++++++
57	5	0	1	0	The first time I went in, it was for a brow wax. Kara suggested a tint and, seriously, who KNEW my brows could look so good!!! Anyway, I was curious about a Brazilian and asked her a TON of questions. The next time I went in, I went for it. My first waxing was a bit painful, but Kara is fast and so professional. If you are thinking about it...I say go for it, because it really doesn't hurt that bad (after the first time) and I LOVE IT!!!
57	5	0	0	0	Kara is absolutely wonderful! She does a GREAT waxing and I am going to have her do a facial for me very soon.  ... The atmosphere is very relaxing and Kara is an absolute doll of a person. I would highly recommend her!

58	4	1	1	1	Great place to buy used games
58	2	0	1	0	Well I do not know what I was expecting to happen when I walked into this store as my past experiences have been pretty bad. Yes I could go to my local Wal-Mart or super pricey Best Buy store but, I like to buy a game without having to sell a kidney. Call me crazy (lol). Anyways my experience always starts off OK as I normally get at least a hi or a short glance in my direction to let me know that at least they noticed I have walked in the building.  ...  ... The problems seem to start when I try to have a conversation with any of their employees. It seems that instead of hiring people who have ever played a video game, they would rather employ a staff of uneducated, and unmotivated teens more focused on talking about how much they hate their job. Now we all have done the same thing but not in front of customers while they are looking over merchandise.  ...  ... Let me be fair and make the point that there are tons of games and many systems out there so it is impossible to know everything. But when I ask you about a game that you have posters for tacked up all over your store and you tell me you do not know then there is a problem. So will I ever go back there??  ...  ... Maybe someday when they increase their selection, lower the prices, and take the time to train their employees. After all why stock 50 copies of a game no one wants instead of offering a more popular selection that will actually make you money?
58	4	0	0	1	I've never been in a gamestop with rude staff. I don't know how they find these teenagers, but gamestop has some of the friendliest staff on the planet. Furthermore I'm very impressed with their knowledge. They must have an excellent staff training program.
58	5	0	0	0	Of all of the GameStops in the Phoenix Metro area, this is the best to go to. I have been going to this one since the day I bought my house down the road and I would go out of my way to keep shopping here. ...  ... I have a great rapport with Dean, Jason, Kevin, and Todd who do an outstanding job of providing knowledgable information about games and are not afraid to share their opinions on a particular game. If I come in not knowing what I am looking for, the staff are great at finding out what I like to play and recommending an appropriate title I might like. ...  ... If you want to go to a place where you'll get canned responses and foolishly unhelpful staff, go buy from Wal Mart or Best Buy, in many cases you will end up spending more of your money at those places. But if you want honest prices and excellent staff, hit up this GameStop, they are the best.

59	5	1	1	0	I have been getting professional massages for over 5 years and I have always preferred a male masseuse for my deep tissue massages because in my past experiences, they were stronger.  ... I started seeing Arianna in October 2010 and I highly recommend her. In fact, she's the only Bay Area based female massage therapist that I can recommend. She is unexpectedly strong! I have a lot of tension in certain areas, and Arianna was able to get all of that out and I got up completely loosey goosey :) Ariana is always friendly, professional, thoughtful and attentive. Go to her for a massage!
59	5	0	2	0	My massage at The Butterfly Effection was absolutely heavenly! Tania's calm and gentle demeanor instantly put me at ease. But don't be fooled--she's not shy when it comes to working out the knots! So rarely do I get a masseuse that is so in tune with my body.  ...  ... Thanks for an awesome massage experience, Tania! I'll see you next month!
59	5	0	2	0	Top notch massage therapist, really personable and a great bedside manner.  I had a hour session with Tania and she let me choose my own music and was really attentive to where I wanted the focus to be done all the while maintaining great conversation at my leisure.  She's got a whole secret cache of lotions and oils of various purposes and scents I can't even pronounce, but it's nice to have options.  An hour later all my knots were out, and I felt like a new man.  I'd definitely go back there if I didn't live way out in San Francisco.
59	5	1	0	1	can i just say that if i could give her 10 stars, i would! she is very nice and very sweet, i felt completely comfortable around her the whole time! i felt AMAZING afterwards, like a new man!! i can't wait to treat my friends to massages from her! i HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!
59	5	0	1	0	I get massages pretty often because I hold a lot of tension, generally, so I've seen all kinds of massage therapists in all different departments over the years.  ...  ... Most of the time massage therapists are too light and don't effect much or too hard and throw me out of whack in a BAD way. So  it goes without saying that I was extremely surprised to find how good Arianna is at what she does, without having any prior experience with me personally.  ...  ... She found my tension points and massaged the areas I specified really well, and alleviated much pain. ...  ... That massage was great. Her advice about epson bath salts was very useful and if you want someone who really knows the body--evidenced by her ability to hone in on what you need personally and not just go through the routine that she does for everyone and is not well applied--I would highly recommend you go check out what she does. Not to mention really excellent bedside manner.  ...  ... Keep up the amazing work!
59	5	0	0	0	Arianna with Butterfly Effection is a very professional massage therapists. My wife and I have a busy schedule and thought it would be nice to have someone come to us. She came over with everything she needs to make our evening a real treat. I would definitely use Arianna again here at home. I just called to schedule a time for our massage and she did a wonderful job. So save some time by driving to a spa have Arianna come to you !!  Thanks for an awesome massage.
59	5	0	1	0	I love Arianna! She's my favorite female massage therapist. I've been going to her for years and she's fantastic. Strong, knowledgeable, helpful, always friendly, professional and attentive, shemakes house calls at no extra charge to you (I live in SF and she lives in the East Bay), which is incredibly generous and convenient.I hired her for a spa party for a bridal shower and all attendees loved it and her! She gave thorough massages to all 6 of us and everyone was very pleased and felt very pampered. Definitely go to her for a massage!

Our first order was  pan fried dates stuffed with almonds and wrapped in bacon with a wine reduction sauce (3.5 stars) and quesa fundido, baked cheese in a roasted pepper and tomato sauce (2.5 stars).  We then shared an order of paella which was mediocre due to the absence of saffron, a good seafood broth and chorizo (2 stars).  The meal was concluded with delicious flan (4 stars).
60	4	0	0	0	Frank... It's not a bar if there is no poker machines... (The Dive Bar excluded. ...  ... Barcelona is a great hidden spot in Vegas. It's relaxed, and the sangria is great. Once in after a couple times, the staff knows you by name, and  the food is nothing but amazing. It's great to have such quality in the neighborhood.
60	2	0	1	0	The worse Paella I have ever tasted. The rice was soggy, no trace of saffron and a very strong fish flavor.  The bacon wrapped dates were decent 3.5 stars. Our waiter appeared depressed, didn't smile or engage us until the very end (tip time). I notice they have this poor girl standing at 7 am at the corner of Cactus and Dean Martin waving a sign to join them for Happy Hour. This wouldn't be necessary if they improve the quality of their food.
61	5	0	1	0	What a delicious cake! You never hear people rave about wedding cake but we surely heard a ton of praise from our guests. Not only was our cake delicious but a part of it was also gluten free. That's right - gluten free. Thankfully, they didn't up the price astronomically. Instead, Diana and Juan do the honest thing and just charge for the increase in ingredient cost to make the cake gluten free. I searched for so long looking for a cake I could eat. We made a wonderful investment by hiring Lady Diana's Cakes. On top of that, Diana and Juan delivered the cake at 7:30 PM so it would be the perfect temperature. They even helped the caterer cut the cake so it would be perfect. Our wedding coordinator who did not know Lady Diana's before could not stop telling me how amazing they were. If you are looking for a delicious cake that looks beautiful and doesn't break the bank, Lady Diana's is the best. They are kind, caring, generous and talented people. I can't wait to need to order a cake again. Thanks for a great job!

61	5	0	0	0	I had the BEST brownie of my life here today!!!!!! It was the salt caramel thing - absolutely unbelievable!!!! I ended up getting 6 to take with me! So excited to have this wonderful place in my neighborhood!!!
61	5	1	6	0	How sad that the reviewer below is so upset- they are very clean and sanitary- bare hands is preferable in cooking enviornments because it allows people to be more accurate and in most cases, cleaner because of the constant hand washing- they're more aware of the need to wash hands and clean up. When you wear gloves, people tend to touch everything and not change their gloves because they're un aware of the risk. ...  ... My review: ...  ... Lady Diana's Cakes is fabulous! ...  ... We ordered a smaller, two tiered cake for our wedding and Juan and Lady Diana still gave us the attention and care as if we had ordered a huge cake with all the bells and whistles. ...  ... Juan was fantastic, I sent him a few ideas of the kinds of cake that we liked and he gave great feedback and completely embraced the elegant style that we were going for. A few days before the wedding Juan called me to ask about the ribbon color and without fail he produced the perfect match, at Lady Diana's Cakes they care about every detail! ...  ... We noticed something wonderfully peculiar about the cake when Juan delivered it to the venue....it was taller than we had ordered! Lady Diana took extra time and supplies to create a cake that was especially beautiful for us, a very sweet gesture that did not go unnoticed. ...  ... The cake was delicious red velvet with amazing icing, we were going to save the top tier for our anniversary...but it we couldn't help but eat it as soon as we got home from our mini honeymoon. Needless to say we'll be ordering a new small red velvet cake for our 1st anniversary :) ...  ... If you want something beautiful and delicious from someone who geniunely cares, Lady Diana's Cakes is the place to go.
61	5	0	0	0	Lady Diana's makes amazing scones! I bought a blueberry scone this morning and it was so tender and really delicious! None of that rock-hard crap the one particularly popular coffee shop serves up (Lucy's are also sadly disappointing). I wish I had gotten an orange cranberry one too! Scones were nearly 3bucks, so a bit of a splurge for my budget but good.  ... Also picked up a peanut butter brownie and a german chocolate cupcake. All the cupcakes looked so amazing! I think the cupcake was $2.99 and the brownie $2.89. The cupcakes probably taste better than Sprinkles cupcakes, which I think are overrated, especially for the price.
61	5	0	0	0	AMAZING! WONDERFUL! TALENTED! DELIGHTFUL! ... I ordered a custom cake for my Granddaughters 2nd Birthday!  I called and spoke with Diana, our party theme was Under the Sea! We chose the quarter sheet 3 layer vanilla butter cake with lemon curd and raspberry filling topped with italian buttercream frosting!  I asked Diana if she needed a napkin sample or decoration to work from, she said no and told me she had a great design in mind!  ... WOW what a cake!!  It turned out beautiful, the detail was amazing, fish, starfish, a sand dune with a giant crab and many other creative touches....not only on the top but all around the sides of the cake too!  The cake was moist, the icing was perfect not too sweet so smooth and creamy!  All of the fish and detailing was edible and again not over sweet!! You can taste the difference of fresh ingredients! ... No more store bought cakes for this family!! ... Great customer service too!! ... Patti M.

Everyone was floored  after viewing the cake. It was exactly what we had wanted.We went all over town trying to find a bakery we were happy with.Lady Diana's bakery is small ,but high quality. We found it by accident. ...           We tasted a sample and were sold on Lady Diana. They only use fresh ingredients and don't cut corners. ...          Juan was great to work with. He even delivered it to us. I know that we will us them for another special event coming up.
61	5	0	2	2	OMG!!!! That is best to describe the birthday cake that Lady Diane made for ... my really good friends 50th birthday celebration. It surpassed my expectations. ... It was so beautiful we hated to cut through it and talk about delicious, it was ... white cake with fresh strawberry's and I selected an Italian butter cream ... frosting, which I wasn't to sure of because I thought it was going to be to  ... sweet, but Lady Diane let me taste it and it was so creamy with the consistency ... of whip cream ( it was good).  I rely on internet ratings to choose my vendors ... and this place needs to be recognized. I promise you will not be disappointed! ...  ... Awesome customer service by the way.

61	1	0	0	0	I am out of the area (in California) and trying to coordinate a birthday party for my Grandmother in Pheonix for which I need a cake.  I have attempted to reach Lady Diana's for about a week via email and phone with no response.  Very poor customer service in my opinion.  Won't even give them another chance.
61	5	0	0	0	I have never before experienced such wonderful treats as those at Lady Diana's. Where to start? Well, her frostings are amazing. Her Italian butter cream is so smooth and sweet but at the same time not overpowering as some frostings can be. I am actually not a big fan of frosting but I have yet to taste one at Diana's that I did not completely love! The peanut butter, the cream cheese and the classic butter cream are all just as good. Her brownies are head over heals fantastic. The ganache is glorious. Her salted caramel is probably my favorite, but the peanut butter is runner up. The best part of Diana's is Diana and Juan. They are so sweet and genuine and such hard workers. Diana's creativity and devotion to each custom order is an absolute blessing. And to top it all off everything is from scratch. There is no processed crap in any of it. She caters to food allergies as well. If you have not visited this bakery stop whatever you are doing and go bless yourself with a treat from there.
61	5	0	0	0	Lady Diana catered and served my 40th birthday party with 50+ guests as well as a 50 person fundraiser I organized and the food and sweets were delicious!  I've also had numerous pies, cakes, and cupcakes over the last few years from Lady Diana's Cakes and Catering and they are the most scrumptious and delicious things I've ever tasted!  She has a way with all types of frosting that is unbelievable! Her frosting has no resemblance to the bland sugary stuff at the typical grocery store bakery.  Her Italian buttercream frosting is heaven! I think my favorite sweet in the ENTIRE WORLD is Lady Diana's carrot cake.  It is moist and delicious with the most amazing melt in your mouth cream cheese frosting. Simply amazing!
61	5	0	2	1	Diana and Juan are  both professional and the absolute BEST @ what they do!!!  I work for a rather large church and Lady Diana's handles all of our christmas pastery and dessert orders.  They are always on time and never disappoint.  Whether you are planning for a few or 500 people ( in our case), they are THE way to go! ... DELICIOUS!!!!!!
61	5	0	1	0	Diana,uses only the freshest Ingredients which combined with her great talent makes for a wonderful eating experience . Not only is her bakery goods superb but so i her catering    ...  I have been fortunate. Enough to have had Diana cater several events for me and every one was original amdso very delicious .  Both Diana  and Juan are warm and caring people and will go way out of their way to help make anything they are involved in to be the best it can be. ...  ... I can't say enough good things about Lady Diana's Cakes & Catering to do it justice but for those of you who haven't tried her great bakery are really missing out of something very special. ...  ...  ... We are so very lucky to have this wonderful couple in our area.h
61	4	0	0	0	Lady Diana's no longer sells my favorites! ... No more danish pastry, bear claws or scones. Now they sell mainly cupcakes and brownies. So no more bakery visits for me. ...  ... One time I was given a sample of challah bread which was wonderful. Bread is only available by preorder though.
61	4	6	7	6	Sweet Delights for sure!  If you are a brownie lover and want to try to find your favorite go to Lady Dianes and check them out. Their Peanut Butter  Chocolate Brownies are so good I want to slap my mother!   ...  ... Right now Lady Dianes Bakery facing 19th avenue is  needing business because of the construction traffic/ So this is a great time to take a delish treat to the office or to a friend  or just eat a goodie for yourself.  You will not be sorry.
61	5	2	5	5	This cupcake deserves to live.   Saw on FB they were suffering greatly under the burden of only the onset of a predicted 3 years of light rail construction.  Made this first visit as mission of mercy.  There will be no more "mercy".  I am their's for life or for however long before light rail construction forces them to move, but please, please, don't close.  I've only just found you and parting would be a not sweet but bitter sorrow.  ...  ... I am so over over-priced cupcakes, but I am their's from the first delectable, moist, absolutely unequivocally  delicious bite of the "Chocolate Intensity" cupcake.  One might fear an overload of chocolate on chocolate violence but this was love, not war.  Friend Norm vouches for the exquisite gluten-free version of same.  Note they have a number of additional gluten-free offerings.   ...  ... Picked up 1/2 dozen of the massive, easily-serves-2 brownies and am struggling to hold on to that "for later" resolve to keep from diving face-down into that box (It's been done - I've seen me do it -see profile pic))  to sample those massive salted caramel, chocolate ganache,  peanut butter chocolate, and chocolate pecan turtle brownies. And note they're more than just big square brownies in appearance - each has it's own professionally crafted elegance, from the lattice of dripped chocolate atop one, to another that gave me the impression of small waves of rich dark chocolate on top.   ...  ... Note that it's a small shop with a single bakery counter out front and not a lot of inventory on display or presumably on hand, but they do much more than cupcakes and brownies BY SPECIAL ORDER, including all manner of tarts, pastries, danish, turnovers, cookies, cakes, and wedding cakes, etc.  They  cater and deliver as well.   ...  ... According to the web page: open Tuesday - Saturday, 10-6. Phone: (602) 331-0333.   Bakery located in small shopping center at NE corner of 19th Ave & Northern, adjacent to Gyros House,  facing 19th Avenue and close to the Boston Market and Einstein Bagels end of the center.  Construction traffic making it difficult to get there but it's well worth the trouble.  If your (my) dieting determination must die, let it be in the face (or taste) of such as what's offered at Lady D's so that it might at least might be truly worthwhile.  Highly recommend.
61	5	0	0	0	Went to Lady Diana's just yesterday and was very impressed. The gentleman behind the counter was very personable and helpful, the bakery is very clean the display cases show what might be the prettiest cupcakes I've seen in a long time. Now, I've eaten my fair share of cupcakes in Phoenix and have to say these were the lightest, moistest, most delicious ones I've had!! Delicious!!! I took some of the cupcakes I purchased to work and they were a huge hit. Everyone there agreed that these were the best cupcakes they had eaten.  ... Next time I go I will definitely be buying more cupcakes but will also have to try their giant brownies that look equally delicious! ... I highly recommend Lady Diana's to anyone who is looking for a well priced, beautiful and delicious treat! Support this wonderful business!!!
61	4	0	1	1	They made a great birthday cake for my "mother inlaw's" birthday. Their lemon filling was a great tart, lemony filling.  The vanilla cake was moist, the Italian buttercream really nice and it looked beautiful.  While we were picking it up, we noticed the cupcakes and got 3.  All good as well. ...  ... This is a nice shop being hit by the light rail construction -- it's right in the Albertson's center at 19th & Northern.  I know it may add some time to get there, but I think it's worth it, both for the dessert and the support to a great business.
61	5	0	0	0	Made the most beautiful cake for my daughters 6th grade graduation. Thanks for helping to make the day extra special.
61	5	0	0	0	I haven't visited the store, but I had two(!) cupcakes that were provided at a meeting.  The first one was fabulous, the second was to die for!  I'll definitely brave the light rail construction to visit the shop.  You should, too!
61	5	3	6	4	My friend and fellow yelper John M., who waxes poetic when talking about Lady Diana's regular creations, brought me some of this bakery's gluten-free cupcakes to try. They were incredibly rich and decadent -- nothing like what you would expect of gluten-free baked goods.  I have since gone to the bakery myself to get more of these scrumptious, so-good-they-should-be-banned treats. So, do what the wraps on the light rail cars proclaim: even while light rail construction is in progress, go and patronize the businesses on 19th Avenue, especially this gem of a bakery.
61	5	0	0	0	They were terrific to work with and even made one gluten free cup cake for a friend for my son's birthday party. The banana flavor is amazing!   They are now my go to place for cakes!!!!
61	5	0	0	0	We got our wedding cake make by Lady Diana couldn't have been happier. First the cake itself was delicious. From the cake tasting to the wedding cake itself, everything was great. We got the three different types, a white cake with chocolate ganache, a white with lemon curd and a white with strawberry. Juan and Lady Diana were friendly, personable and great to work with. We don't anticipate getting married ever again but we definitely would go back for another cake. Definitely a hidden gem in Central Phoenix.

62	4	0	3	0	Lots of new new to me shops at Tivoli Village and this is one of them.  When I first walked by I wasn't sure what it was.  It appeared to be a high end salon at first but I saw dog dishes at the front and the wording on a t-shirt on a mannequin said sit. speak. chic. so figured check it out.  It is a salon but for dog grooming!  There were only employees present but the explained the concept, pricing, the treat bar, etc.  The prices seem very reasonable and I like that everything is out in the open.  The store is very clean.  They have a couple of pens where the dogs hang out before or after grooming and I like that because I am not a fan of cages.  They also don't do cage drying which is a plus for me.  They have some human attire for sale and grooming products, shampoos, conditioners, etc.  I left with treat samples and with three spoiled dogs at home I'm sure I will be back!
62	4	0	1	0	Beautiful setup with great facilities for grooming your pet, and the affordable treats are suberb!
62	5	1	3	2	There was only one reason for me to go to Tivoli Village until this store opened! Now both my favorite stores there are right next door to each other, Charming Charlie and Shaggy Chic! ...  ... Shaggy Chic is such an adorable store! If you think your pooch is getting spoiled elsewhere, think again! Honestly where else could you get a blueberry facial for your dog?! (Definitely must try!) ...  ... Prices are great and customer service was amazing. I love how comfortable the environment is, I felt like I was being treated as a friend rather than a paying customer. ...  ... Both treats and salon products are so unique, things that I have not seen before.  ... LOVE LOVE LOVE this place.. &also think my dog loves me more since I started bringing her here lol.
62	5	0	0	0	What a wonderful new concept in grooming and caring for your dog.  Kir went right in and put her feet on the counter and asked for a treat and said here I am.  She loved it.  No manicures for her.  Prices are right. ...  ... She can't wait to return.
62	5	0	3	4	I have officially found a great dog groomer in Vegas!! I have tried countless groomers in Vegas, and none have done the quality that Shaggy Chic did. My pup enjoyed a manicure, blueberry facial and a cut/wash. I had never been to Tivoli Village before, but I found a great Salon to get a pedicure at while I waited for my dog. I will definitely be taking her back for another grooming.
62	5	0	1	1	Fabulous grooming on my standard poodle.He has been groomed here several times. The owner has several standard poodles & when I saw one of them in the shop, I was wowed.Enough said....
62	1	1	2	0	This place is horrible!!! The groomers were so rude and unprofessional when I walked in. Then to top it off a groomer by the name of Allison chopped the hair on my dogs ear off. Did not even say anything to me about it until I got my dog home and noticed it. If she cut just a little more she would have cut the tip of his hair off. For 50$ and to be in Tivoli Village (nicer Las Vegas) it was not worth it! service grooming and groomers suck and the place it self is not even up to par. I would NOT recommend anyone to take there dog here. I only ranked it one star because I had to if it was up to me NO STARS.
62	1	1	7	0	I went to this place because I had a groupon. I gave this place one star because the only thing that was great was my puppies haircuts. The service was so horrible, I walked out POed. These people are rude and do not know the definition of customer service. Dropping off my puppies the groomer was extremely rude to my father. She was condescending.  Picking up my dog they did not greet me and literally threw my dog into my arms without saying anything. We paid what we owed and left without a thank you from them. It was as if I was dealing with mute robots. Eventually I decided to give them another chance and made a call the schedule appointment. Bad idea, the lady on the other line basically talked to me like I was incompetent and condescending again. I replied telling her that I don't appreciate the way she was talking to me. So explained to her multiple occasions of my experience with them and she accused me that maybe I was the one being rude. I was furious! I informed her I will no longer need their services and hung up. I feel like I was dealing with teenagers. If they could change their staff to more mature employees that were welcoming than I would go back other than that, beware of these  people.
62	1	0	2	0	This place is horrible!! They almost killed my teacup pom. If you value the life of your dog not to mention the way it looks STAY AWAY FROM HERE!!
62	5	0	0	0	I took my two dogs there today for the first time after hearing great things about Shaggy Chic.  The groomer did an amazing job and my little ones looked great. The owner was there when I dropped them off and she is absolutely lovely. I highly recommend this place!
62	5	1	1	1	Amazing. My dog, Morty, loved his experience. This is the first time Morty did not act up after being groomed. Booking appointment was very easy. During drop-off the owner had me fill out paperwork while asking important questions about who Morty is. Made me feel confident that the business understands that Morty is a member of the family, not just a pet. All the work is done out in the open. I spied from across the street and was impressed with how the groomer handled Morty. No aggressive movements used to get Morty in place. Lots of petting and conversation. No cage drying or loud tools. Also the place is very clean. Price was in line with other groomers.  ... In the past, Morty has left other groomers high strung and panting. For a couple days after he would be "annoyed" . Morty left Shaggy Chic  calm and seemed not to be bothered at all by the experience.  ... I highly recommend. ... Morty is a 50lb standard poodle .
62	5	0	0	0	My dog, Blitz, hates being groomed. The last place I took her to had her completely traumatized... when I walked her into Shaggy Chic she immediately started shaking (she's a 50lb Vizsla). The groomer immediately made both Blitz and I totally comfortable- when i came back to pick her up, she was comfortably sitting down- and seemed completely fine. I am so excited to have found a groomer who knows how to treat my dog- I will be back many more times for sure!
62	5	0	0	0	I have my dog on the monthly plan he's a mini poodle and gets dirty fast! This place has gotten his hair to grow and never get matted ally is the best groomer ever! She is so sweet and caring! I love this place he gets anxiety a lot so him being able to be in and out under an hour he loves! I also love how he always gets a bow tie :]
62	5	0	1	0	AWESOME! I used to take my dog here a lot but got really tired of the rude customer service, and the old groomers that would always say "they couldnt cut his face because he was a pain" so needless to say I was really hesitant (but desperate!) to try them again (nearly a year later.)   ...  I am really glad I did though, the whole store has changed, the receptionist was extremely friendly and welcoming and really seemed to care about my little yorkie. Previously the receptionist and groomers were pretty condescending about how I would request to have Jack cut (shaved) not your typical yorkie cut. This time they were happy to do it, and I was insistent on his huge head being cut right now.  ...  It took about an hour and a half , which for jack is REALLY quick. When I went to pick him up I was again greeted by everyone and the groomers were awesome and said Jack did really good, and how cute he looked, I was a bit skeptical still. When I saw him though I was so happy! Jack looks awesome, they cut him exactly how I needed and his large head was cut right down.  ...  ... They totally re-sold me on bringing jack back to Shaggy Chic and I was extremely happy with everything, I will be back definitly.

So I called around 930AM to see if I could drop my baby off earlier. They said I could bring her in anytime I wanted. I dropped her off around 10 and she was so excited to be getting all the attention from the staff. They called me around 3PM to let me know she was ready. I picked her up around 430 and she was all clean and fresh and pampered. The groomer told me she had her nails clipped, ears and eyes cleaned, a blueberry facial, and a bath. She looked adorable in her little periwinkle colored satin bow. I went to pay and was shocked at how cheap it was for everything. Only 35.00! I will definately be back!
63	4	0	1	1	I knew Willow House back in the days when it was a pet store.  It serves its neighborhood purpose and that purpose is good.
63	1	0	1	3	I'm sorry, but this place is just plain skanky.  I am all about supporting local businesses...  so long as they are clean, have a pleasant staff, and a good concept.
63	2	4	4	4	I would love to love the Willow House.  I really want to, it's downtown and local.. I just can't.  Dirty, bad coffee, rude staff, horrible art on the walls, plus I can't go here without running into a student of mine.  It all adds up to only 2 stars.  I'm sorry Willow House, I really do want to love you, I just can't.
63	2	2	1	1	Willow house is architecturaly charming, however it has no other redeeming qualities. They coffees are ones you more or less settle for. Pasteries as mediocre as the people who go there- all of whom are scenesters. It could be nice if it weren't so scene. That and perhaps better coffee.
63	2	0	2	2	I had the damndest time trying to find this place! I was supposed to go a couple weeks ago and got so frustrated I turned my car around and hung out in Tempe instead. Tonight-I was bloody determined to find it. Still got turned around, but finally-hidden behind a bunch of trees and connected some kind of sporting event sales place, there was the Willow House-damn! ...  ... Beautiful stones laid out on the grass, a kind of bubbling brook (man-made) and a lot of picnic tables on the corner of McDowell and 2nd Ave, let to stairs to the actual Willow House. There were tons of options on the board but no prices (?) and the pastries, as noted, did not look that appealing. The barista I thought was pleasant and made small talk and a small chai soy latte. It came to a whopping $4.09 (!) which I was pretty surprised by, but coughed up the cash. It was actually a mix and way too sweet for me, but he did steam the soy for me pretty well. ...  ... With Soy Chai in hand, I wandered around. It is narrow at first and there all these Mexican and day of the dead kind of knick-knacks and random merchandise displayed. There is a little nook, must have been a closet, with some random vintage clothing reasonably priced and handsomely displayed there. I noted to my right was a Non-Smoking room with some people intent on laptops and older couples chatting-seemed pleasant and actually a little quiet (couldn't tell if it was a 'weird' quiet or a nice zen like quiet). I wandered more (this place is deceptively large) and ended up in a large open room with chairs and large tables where people could smoke. It opened out to a glass-enclosed narrow front room (that faced McDowell) with a high counter and some two seater and four seater tables. There were guys chatting and talking about chainsaws (I was reminded somewhat eerily of Linklater's movie Slacker). I moved away from that odd little conversation to a room with cheap LPs, some awesome 2 buck cassette tapes (Best of Bill Cosby, Guns n Roses, Heart-what!), an odd little table and interesting but somewhat amatuerish art on the walls. Unfortunately this also let me peer into a small backroom/dark kitchen (!?) with a dude making a sandwich...with his barehands. It was kind of creepy. Dream-like, really. I quickly walked away from that observation and noted never to get a sandwich here. I stumbled upon some more nooks and crannies displaying totebags and glass jewelrey before stepping out and resting at one of their picnic tables and watching the traffic on McDowell. ...  ... Eh.
63	5	4	2	2	I grew up with it so I love it. ... But the people who go there are fairly annoying, especailly when they talk really loud about art, trying to sound artistic. ... I actually like the coffee, Abbott. Not the best, but I like the mexicali. ...  ... I wish they would serve Dim Sum.
63	4	0	2	3	This place deserves four stars for the eclectic and eccentric qualities. BUT!!! I take away one star because I always turn south down 3rd Avenue forgetting its a one way street. Now, my only defense is that I am mostly hung over when I go here, so I know not which way I drive but that I am going towards the great heavenly beacon known as the coffee house vibe. Is it me, or does everyone recover at a coffee house??  ...      Willow has got what it takes to make the place stick in anyone's imagination. From Dia de los Muertos Sugar Skulls to strange nic nak oddities being sold, this place has consumer crap to wrap your hands around in addition to the coffee! Nightly, they have a projection screen and show indie films and again other eclectic big screen oddities .        Toss out your super large flat screen TV....well dont, and head down to Willow House for some cozy big screen movie watching complete with the aura and mystic of your favorite coffee beverage.
63	2	4	2	2	Willow house is... what's the word? Oh yeah... super-frightening.  ...  ... It's a Clive Barker-esque nightmare house that serves overpriced coffee and smells of bad incense. The staff have never been friendly to me and that's part of the reason that I quit going. The coffee isn't bad, but I've had better. ...  ... For the life of me I can't figure out why the patch of grass out front is always crawling with people at 10 o'clock at night. It must be some sort of ritualistic vampire ceremony... or it could be the wifi.
63	4	1	2	3	I've been putting off a review of Willow House because it's like examining your childhood to me.  Do we want to admit that things have changed?  Can we let go of the goals and dreams we had?  Are we willing to see it with new perspective, or will it always be remembered the way we experienced it then? ...  ... I've decided I'm not willing to let go.  My favorite Willow House times were before the grass and the bubbling fountain.  Before the new display case that totally cut down on the goodies they offer, but gave them more storage space behind the counter.  Before it was taken over by AA meetings.  Back when there was a whole living room set, in the living room - instead of just more tables.  Back when there was a "take a book, leave a book" section that was always fascinating to peruse.  Before they painted on the smiley/funky faces all around the top edges, and then years later painted over them in an effort to update their looks.  But I still like it now too. ...  ... I still see echos of my Willow House now and then.  When the crowd at the poetry night isn't too loud (We didn't use microphones! Who needs microphones? Wimps.).  If someone outside is strumming an acoustic guitar.  When the banter while ordering is just so.  Or when on a quiet afternoon mid week you see folks hiding out in the small rooms working hard on a term paper - though now it's with laptops instead of our pile of books and note paper. (Dang it makes me feel old) I think the coffee/chai/italian sodas are all pretty good.  The desserts aren't as good now as they used to be, but they aren't bad. ...  ... It's not a fancy spot, but it's a great neighborhood coffee shop.  And for some folks, it's a destination spot.  And for those of us who grew up with it, its just a soft spot in our hearts.
63	2	4	2	1	Okay.  I really, really wanted to like the Willow House.  When I moved here from Tucson, I was looking for an establishment that would replace the coffee shop that I grew up with, called The Safehouse.  Most people told me that the Willow House was the place to go. ...  ... Now, this might have been unfair for the Willow House, because of my enduring, unrequited love for the Safehouse, but I still tried so very hard to enjoy it. ...  ... The coffee is, truthfully, substandard.  Anything requiring more complex preparation then a cup of hot water not only takes exceptionally long to prepare, but then is prepared without any thought to quality.  I don't expect coffee to stand up and assault my taste buds, but I usually expect it to stand out in some fashion.  A local establishment without any redeeming qualities against a Starbucks isn't someplace that I'd recommend for a cup o' joe. ...  ... I didn't sample much of the food, only a sandwich or two, but what I did order was adequate.  The portions were good, although a little overpriced for what you receive, but still tasty and filling. ...  ... But the main clencher for me was, you guessed it, the clientele.  Swarming with a variety of age groups and earning brackets, it really seemed like a good place to mingle and try to meet people.  I was ready to overlook it's other downfalls in favor of this one redeeming quality, until I actually met some of them. ...  ... I'm not a snob, but I prefer intelligent conversation.  If you sit down to play chess with someone who is sitting there with a chess set, I'd hope that you'd bring something to the table other then an easy victory for me.  Even if you do lose, that doesn't give you leave to pick up my king side bishop and toss it under a couch.  Also, bathing is nice. ...  ... These could've been isolated incidents, but I couldn't go here without something of this ilk happening.  Maybe I'm just outgrowing establishments like this.  But still, in my honest opinion, Willow House doesn't deserve more than a two of five.
63	2	1	1	1	Willow House is really stinky, like garbage stinky. What's up with that? ...  ... Free wifi is cool, and the coffee is standard. AA meetings go on there, so that may be why there's that bizarre nightly influx of patrons late into the night.  ...  ... The food is downright putrid, but it gets 2 stars for having survived this long, even with that godawful stink.
63	2	1	1	2	It's a shithole but I go there because I (less and less) because  live close and the WIFI is free. I like LUX  a lot better and am more and more likely to make the trek. ...  ... Every night is either lesbian folk music night, open mic night which seems to attract talentless unbathed losers, or 12 step biker gang night. ...  ... I lifted up the toilet seat to pee one time and a roach scurried out from underneath. WTF? Don't eat food there. The roach probably ran right from the dirty toilet rim right to the kitchen for a snack.  Imagine if someone had sat down instead and the roach crawled up on them right between their legs? Shiver at the thought. ...  ... I work at home a lot and sometimes go there during the day for the free iced tea refills and wifi, just to get out of the house. Less and less as I trek over to LUX a lot more now which is clean and has a clientle that aren't mouth-breathers.
63	2	8	8	7	I'm going to go ahead and say this place sucks.  ...  ... This place claims to be a "Seattle style coffee shop". After living in Seattle for a few years, and hitting every coffee spot in the city at least once, I think I can fairly comment on that. First off, the coffee is pretty good. It's definitely Seattle style coffee, though realistically not up to Seattle standards at all. That's alright, this is a coffee shop in Phoenix, where there are few (if any) shops that actually hold up to the quality of Seattle coffee.  ...  ... What really rubs me the wrong way, and definitely doesn't fit in with the Seattle element, is the service and staff at this place. I don't want to say this is the case with everyone that works here, as Ben and DJentrification (sorry I don't know your real name) have always been awesome whenever I've gone in, but the majority of people that work here are really stuck up. Maybe this should be stated another time and another place, but: ...  ... Dear Phoenix hipster: ...  ... You really aren't that cool. You just got into riding fixed gear bikes six months ago when anyone that lives in a real city knows it's been the only way to go for years. You just got into "anarchist folk punk" and "psychadelic freak folk" when all the cool kids have moved on to snorting coke and dancing naked in clubs to Yelle. You are behind. You really are not hip. If you lived in a real city (which hopefully Phoenix will become) you would not be considered hip. You would be considered what you are, a stuck up prick. ...  ... Sorry for the rant, but that leads me to the reason this is NOT a Seattle style coffee shop. In Seattle, there will be actual "hip" people working at the shop. These people will actually respect culture, art, fashion, design, music, and all the other "cool kid" shit. However, these people do not act above you. I get service when I get coffee in Seattle. In this place, I get treated like I'm not worthy of standing in the shitty old house that looks/smells like the staff cleans it once every six months. ...  ... I brought my mom here once after spending a day with her at the art gallery. We wanted to get a quick cup of coffee before I headed back to my apartment and she headed back to Mesa. While ordering the guy working the corner had a stupid smirk on his face the whole time and was rude to my mom and was way too pushy with trying to get her to decide what she wanted. He was making some comments to the girl that was working with him and they would look over at her and I and laugh. Look guys, I'm really sorry I'm not still stuck in teenage-angst mode and working for the local shitty coffee shop at 25. I value my moms time and will not put up with you treating her like shit.  ...  ... If this was an isolated incident, I wouldn't even take the time to post this review. But this is the consistent attitude of the people that work at this place. I don't know if the management or owners are aware of this (or even worse, are the same way), but they should probably take a look at who they're hiring and the image it promotes about their business. I'm not shocked at all that this place moved to a far shittier location. A place that provides this level of service doesn't belong in such a beautiful neighborhood. Hopefully the historic house can be used for something other than housing a punch of pricks jerking eachother off over their latest 7" scores.  ...  ... Two stars for the coffee being pretty good whenever I've gone. The coffee is far better at Lux and Drip anyways.
64	4	0	1	1	I think it's necessary to review this place, as reading an Inc. magazine in their waiting area is what prompted me to start writing reviews for Yelp instead of Insider Pages. ...  ... Every 3,000 miles you need an oil change. It's one of the inevitable truths of owning a car, like it or not. A number of these old Texaco service stations were turned into Grease Monkeys in recent years, including this one at Boulder and Greenway/Palo Verde.  ...  ... Quite honestly, I don't think this place has ever been better. Any skepticism I had about a different company taking over has been shattered. ...  ... This is a full-service oil change facility that performs a number of other services as well - including a smog check facility in the back and a car wash. Plus, the property has a convenience store/gas station within walking distance.  ...  ... The waiting room here is a little on the small side, which is a disappointment. However, they do have additional chairs outside if you just want a place to sit while you wait. The waiting room itself has free coffee and water bottles while you wait, plus a restroom. There are several magazines for your reading pleasure as well, covering all interests. Hell, the last time I was in there they even had a Bible!  ...  ... The wait times tend to be a bit inconsistent, but given how congested this place gets that is definitely understandable. Fortunately, the staff are all friendly and will always let you know if your car is in need of some type of repair/replacement/etc. There's a real family mentality going on here, the staff are all nice and they won't try to milk you for every dollar the way some places do. ...  ... One minor complaint I have is that, along with Grease Monkey taking this place over, they no longer give out free car washes with each oil change. However, they make up for this with a "frequent oiler" program, where if you get a certain number of oil changes you can earn a free one. This is useful when you live in a household the size of mine, where there are several cars that need it. ...  ... This place is at a convenient location in the heart of "Old Henderson" and is easily the best facility of its kind in the region. Come here for all your oil change needs - they'll take care of you.
64	1	0	0	0	Went there 10-20-2012.  They told me that my 2012 Scion required synthetic oil, which costs twice as much as conventional.  He showed me the oil fill cap which said weight for conventional and the weight for synthetic.  He then said that Toyota  recommends/requires synthetic.  He said the only time you can use conventional is if you are off in some small town that does not have synthetic....well, little did he know, I may be female, but I have worked in the car industry my entire life!   ... I told him never mind and went straight to the dealer.  I talked to a service writer and asked him what kind of oil they would put in my car if I came in for an oil change, he said conventional, not synthetic.  Obviously,Toyota does NOT recommends, further that synthetic oil is not in the car when purchased! ... I went back to the oil change place and told him I had been to Toyota and what they said.  I then told he is a liar and a thief!  He was trying to up sell me something I did not need, and that is stealing.  Steer clear of this place!
64	5	0	0	0	As a woman in her 40's, it can be very difficult, not to mention frustrating, dealing with any kind of automotive mechanic.  A necessary evil usually.  However, dealing with Shawn and his team, they always tell me when I DON'T need a service that I ask for.   ...      I came here for the 1st time about 6 months ago.  I had my oil changed and asked them to rotate my tires.  I came in today for an oil change and asked about my brakes and they said they looked fine.  No need for brake service today.  Now that's someone I TRUST!  Thanks guys!
65	5	1	1	1	I love Julianne. My kids are learning so much. I like the fact she lets me know what they need to work on for the next time rather than taking my money and leaving. Lol. Plus you can't go wrong with her coming to your house teaching your child to play.
65	5	0	0	0	Julianne has been teaching piano to our twelve-year-old daughter for six years now.  Our daughter loves her lessons, looking forward to them each week.  Julianne is professional, engaging, and wonderfully friendly.  We would highly recommend her.
67	5	0	5	2	Came in for lunch and ordered a pizza with my kids. Food and service was great. I like the atmosphere better now than when it was Boombozz. Hope this place stays around.
67	1	4	0	0	Just had the worst experience of my restaurant life. Went with a group of 15. The place was empty .  Took 20 minutes to get sodas. After an hour and a half wait we left without getting our food. Staff was unpleasant to boot.  I can't imagine this place will be around for long.
67	5	0	2	0	Just came in for a beer and a pizza, great service, the game was on tv, pretty relaxed atmosphere.  I'll be back for sure! Great staff, great food!!
67	5	0	1	2	Stopped in after some shopping for a bite to eat.  I had chicken fried steak and it was not the conventional chicken fried steak, more of a batter fried then a breaded and fried.  It wasn't bad, just not what I was expecting.  My husband had the grilled ribeye.  He loved it., Our waitress Jamie was great.  She was friendly and  attentive, but not overly so.  She suggested dessert and I had the chocolate chip cookie,(freshly baked so it was still warm when she brought it to the table)  with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce.  It's a good size cookie enough for 2 and was delicious.  Will definitely go back again.
67	1	1	0	0	This place has awful service. We had to ask for a beer menu which the hostess had trouble locating. Hello it's a tap house. Anyway no one came to the table to say we'll be right with you so we finally walked out. Told the hostess and she say oh sorry.  ... Never going back.
67	2	0	0	0	Service was slow and it was like the waitress didn't want to be there. Food came out quickly. I recommend the buffalo wings and house ranch sauce, but the fried fish and chicken fingers were completely absent of any flavor. No seasoning at all! Also, expensive so not quite 3 stars.
67	3	0	0	0	I liked it better as Boom Bozz. The staff wasn't all that friendly. The bartender looked like she just rolled out of bed with a flannel shirt on... Love the happy hour pizza (price went up to $5.50) and their beer cheese and pretzels (YUMM). Will I go again, yes. But I just think the staff and service was better when we went a month ago and it was still Boom Bozz.
67	3	0	2	1	Meh. That's it. The atmosphere reminds me of a Chili's or Applebee's or Buffalo Wild Wings; it's boring and plain and generic.  ...  ... The food has potential but needs work. We ordered the portobello mushroom app, buffalo wings, and artichoke dip, and had the Rooster Pizza for dinner. The mushroom was excellent, the wings were cooked well and tasted okay, but the artichoke dip tasted like it was out of a jar. And it was runny.  The bread with the artichoke dip was good. ...  ... The Rooster pizza was good, but that was mostly attributable to the crust.  ...  ... The service was okay. I got confused as to who our server was as two people took our drink orders before anything arrived at our table. The guy who ended up as our server appeared to be busy or otherwise distracted. Not terrible, just room for improvement. ...  ... The bar area looked to be a good place to watch a game and their beer list was excellent. There is potential here and I will likely come back to follow up, and maybe watch the Seahawks game here. I'd like them to improve on their food and service in the dining area, but if it's just a good place to go watch the game and have a beer, that would be okay by me.
67	1	1	0	0	Service was extremely slow, it was about an hour for a basic burger and there was no one in the place. Once we got our food it was over cooked and missing ingredients. We won't be back!
67	5	0	0	0	This is our first time here since the restaurant changed over from Boom Bozz. My burger was delicious, my husband loved the fish and chips, and my son really enjoyed the mac and cheese. The service was amazing, and we will definitely be back!!
67	1	2	0	0	Yesterday, mid day, the bartender was also working in the kitchen, there was one server and the plumbers were there. You can imagine how bad the service was and we sat at the bar! Nice beer selection though!
67	3	1	0	0	Honestly, I love the pizza here. It's my favorite in all of Gilbert. However, I'm struggling with the new concept. You can't fake being a local restaurant. It's very apparent that's what they're doing. The new menu is difficult to follow and doesn't even focus on the best food they have : pizza! The food also went up in price, which is funny since it's all the same food just with different names and descriptions. Then there are the inexperienced and lazy servers they're hired because no decent server wants to stay in that kind of slow environment. I desperately want to give this place a good review but I haven't been happy lately. Especially since they closed 2 hours early on a weeknight without notice. Why have closer times if you're just going to do what you want anyway?
67	3	0	1	1	I've been wanting to try the Pot Roast so I ordered it. One word: bummed. A bit salty. If you can get past the extra grease the roast is decent. I'm not sure where the vegetables were and the mashed potatoes were ok. For $14 you get the Pot Roast, side salad and creamed corn. Salad was very fresh and the cream corn had been sitting awhile. I'd pass on this choice, but not on the service. Service is always good:)
67	1	2	0	0	THIS PLACE WAS HORRIBLE!!! If I had the choice i wouldn't give this place any stars!!! I attended the grand opening and was excited about what was advertised... free drink samples and samples of the appetizers off the happy hour menu. The host staff wasn't very friendly and it went down hill from there. We were seated and the waitress took forever to even acknowledge that we were in her area. She finally did arrive at our table to take our drink order, I am an avid water drinker and do not drink and sodas... so i ordered water like i would normally do. The waitress must have gone to a fresh water spring to get it because it took her forever to bring a simple water back to our table. After she delivered the waters she was gone. She said nothing not an explanation to as what the grand opening was offering not a list of special or to even ask if we had any questions. She finally came back and i had to inquire to as what it was that was being offered, she then shortly described what was going on, nothing more and then she walked away. When she came back she had a small plate of pizza slices, I cleared room for her to set them down under the assumption that this was one of the free samples offered, I was confused to as why she wasnt putting them down... she said nothing for a long time and then finally set the plate down and said that we could just have the plate. I was disgusted at the fact that i was expected to share with everyone else in the restaurant. when she described the free samples i was expecting our own personal plate with a small version of the appetizers that they were offering, but that was not the case. She never asked if we were ready to order, nothing. She brought us another sample of the lettuce wrap and just set it down on our table and walked away. I was so IRRITATED!!! never before have i experienced anything like this. I will not be returning to this establishment nor will i ever suggest it to anyone. The food was simple and plain nothing great at all and the service was HORRID. I will gladly bash this place to anyone of my friends and highly recommend not going  there. HORRIBLE!!!
67	1	3	0	0	First back since the name change. We were excited to see the happy hour list on the wall only to find out that it was only on M -F. There were only times on the board. Two of us order the trail head steak and cheese and it was bland and tasteless. With sauted onions, peppers and mushrooms I was expecting some nice seasoning and flavor, but the were was none.  The size of the sandwich was quite small, the meat was almost non existing and the bread was just short of being burnt. The Caesar salad fell way short of expectations and price for my niece. The children's pizza was the best dish on the table, sad to say.  Not sure we will be going back. If we weren't running late for a movie I would have sent it back and spoke to the manager about the slow service and disappointing food.  We enjoyed when it was Boombazz.  Not sure what happened in the change.  Hopefully the will do something to make us want to come back!
67	3	0	0	0	The pretzels with quest dip and spinach artichoke dip was delish! I had the buffalo chicken salad which was good. The service was poor however- it took a long time to be greeted, get drinks, put orders in. I had to ask for more water and for dressing for my salad. My boyfriend got a burger and when he asked for another side of ketchup the guy pointed to the tiny cup on his plate and said you have some already.  ... I like the vibe of the place for a happy hour or simple dinner- but the service needs to improve!
67	5	0	0	0	I came here with a friend from work for the grand opening celebration. The first thing that caught my attention was the great music being played. I walked in to the tune of "You Give Love a Bad Name," and the DJ was excellent throughout the evening, mixing up classic rock, country, and modern popular songs. ...  ... The host and our server were very pleasant to us. As you would expect from the American TapHouse name, the beer selection was better than the average bar, offering national, local, and regional beers on tap. ...  ... The appetizer samples we got were the cashew chicken wrap, pepperoni pizza, and carnitas sliders. The wrap was decent, and the sliders had an unexpected but not unwelcome spicy kick to them. ...  ... The pizza here is what makes me want to come back again. As Tracy Jordan might say, "I want to take that pizza back behind the middle school and get it pregnant." Both in the restaurant and as leftovers, the mushroom and sausage pizza was perfectly delicious. They get the crust just right, and the other flavors capitalize on that to deliver an excellent pizza experience. ...  ... This is a fun place to hang out, watch sports, and have some great beer and pizza.
67	1	5	2	1	I greatly dislike to leave negative comments but the food was tasteless and very poor looking,  the service was great (our server) very attentive and helpful,  when the manager came to our table he seemed incredibly nervous and just stood there looking at us (very uncomfortable) I could not hear him speak either and it was awkward, you could tell he had no interest or he did not care. Our prior visit I had really enjoyed our food, I ordered the same and regretted it. We left very disappointed.  Unfortunately I can't see us coming back.
67	5	0	0	0	Stopped in to watch the game.  Great selection of beer.  Had the Portobello mushroom appetizer and the Rooster Pizza.  The mushroom was excellent.  One of my pet peeves with pizza is the crust.  This one was delicious.  Perfect crust and cooked just right.  Will definitely go back.
67	4	0	2	1	Spotless place!  The food is great.  Love the burgers and pizzas.  I am not a thin crust guy, but their thin crust is awesome!  The service is fast and friendly and the patio is very cool!
67	5	0	1	0	Awesome food. ... great service. .... great atmosphere. ... friendly staff. ...they treat you like family :) ...  ... Highly recommended
67	1	2	0	0	Management has no clue what they are doing. Always mess up the orders and management hides in the back. Food could be ok but it never comes out right. They wont be open much longer as boombozz was way better and went out of business.
67	1	1	0	0	Service is horrible. Walking to the bathroom, your get a glimpse of the kitchen. Food is stacked up and waiting. Servers seem to be lost and not sure how to get food out. 6 orders took 50 min with items missing. Very unorganized and no one seems to want to serve. Food was meh, and small by comparison to price.
67	1	1	0	0	Went there after some family fun time near by and was a bit hesitant based on the reviews I saw here. We gave it a shot anyway and we are definitely sorry we did. They took 50 mins to bring out our food and when it did not all of it made it. They forgot my girls whole order (a burger) and my daughters fries. If I could give this place half a star I would and that would only be for how nice the waiter was. Do Not Eat Here. There are plenty of other places that deserve your money in these hard times.
67	2	1	0	0	We went to this place before when it was under different ownership and it wasn't too bad. But this time we were very disappointed. Service was slow. Our hamburgers were tasteless. Very disappointing.  On a more positive note I like how they've added more TVs and I do like the atmosphere, and our server was very friendly. They just need to get a new chef and a new menu.
67	3	0	0	0	Great service nice interior unfortunately the paparica wings were over cooked and a bit dry  house salad was good :|
67	3	0	2	0	This really deserves 2*, but I'm giving it 3 to give the benefit of the doubt and to account for some positive aspects. Overall, to me, the place is just latching onto the craft beer movement without really knowing enough about it to justify their "TapHouse" name, kind of a like if a wine bar didn't know much about wine.  ...  ... Positives: decent happy hour; nice, clean, modern interior; easy to get a table on a Friday night; good wings (esp. on happy hour); and decent selection of beers. The bartender (when I finally left our table and went to the bar) was helpful, seemed to know her beers, and gave me some samples while I was deciding. ...  ... Negatives: they haven't trained their servers enough about the beers, and the information on the beer menu is inadequate. For example, I asked our server for the name of the brewer of a beer listed on the menu as "Nitro 5 Barrel Pale Ale," and he said "Nitro." It went like that all night. (Nitro is the name of the gas, and the brewer is Odell.) We had a big problem with the bill at the end of the night; we couldn't tell which beers had been rung up on happy hour and which hadn't (since there's just a deduction at the bottom of the bill), and they had to fix it. Then they overcharged by about $36 when did did a cash/credit card split; luckily our math skills weren't that impaired, but then it took a good 15-20 more minutes to fix it. Overall service was slow considering that the place wasn't that busy, but I felt bad for our waiter, who really seemed to be trying. I wasn't impressed with the pretzels (more doughy than pretzely); pizza was just ok.
67	1	2	3	0	Ok, I have never heard this before.... ...  ... Me:  are there happy hour food specials? ... Server:  yes, these appy's are only $5 during happy hour. (reg $8) ... Server:  oh and by the way they are half orders... ... Me:  So I get 50% less food for 30% less money??  Really, that's the "special"?? ... Server:  Yes, that's how all bar happy hours operate!  (defensively) ... Me: So it's more expensive to order the "special"  - Server:  I guess so. ...  ... So anyways, that's just one indication of why at 5:30 pm there were 6 people here. ...  ... The food was adequate, the place was nice.. No atmosphere.
67	2	2	1	1	I'm always looking for a new spot to try and this place is about a mile from my house. We came in during happy hour and the place was pretty dead. Our server was nice and very attentive, but can tell he was bored with his lack of tables because he came over every 5 minutes. Food choices are American (burgers, salads, sandwiches). We ordered beers, which were $5 for craft beer pints. Beer choices here are good. For HH prices though, I wasn't too impressed. Appetizers are still between $5-10. ...  ... For dinner, I ordered the Wrangler burger and fries. I was told to stay far away from the coleslaw, as recommended by our server. My boyfriend ordered the philly cheesesteak and fries. Food arrived and mine tasted fine. My boyfriend said his philly was very dry and the bread was clearly burnt. He couldn't wait to leave. I can't say my burger was bad because it wasn't. I liked the egg bun too. Fries were not warm though and that was a bummer. ...  ... We didn't get dessert, just the check. We left for about $30. Sorry TapHouse but we won't be back. Nothing special here
67	2	1	3	0	We used to go here when it was BoomBozz because we liked the food and beer selection but the service was terrible, especially towards the end. We decided to try it again now that it has changed names and owners. Beer selection is still pretty good, but the service is still pretty bad and the food is "meh" at best. ...  ... We walked in, were seated immediately, and then told our server was missing. Not a problem we thought, someone else took our drink order, and then never returned. Several minutes later a man I saw smoking in the parking lot when we drove in came to the table and announced he would be taking our order. Glad he got his smoke break in while we waited with children on a busy Saturday night. Awesome. ...  ... From there the service was REALLY SLOW and at times non-existent. When the food came the order was wrong for my daughter but they did quickly fix it which I really appreciated. I can't say much else about the food except that it was just bland. Mac and cheese was bland. Pizza was bland. Everything bland. So much potential. I mean, it is all basically comfort food, and there was nothing special there at all.  ...  ... There are so many other places in the area with a better beer selection and much better food and service. We will probably not be back.
67	4	0	0	0	I ate here for lunch a couple days ago with a friend. The food was good, had a pastrami sandwich with fries and a cup of clam chowder.  Everything was prepared well and I was happy with the service also. They seem to have quite a few beers on tap here also. The price wasn't extremely high but was a bit much for a couple of sandwiches with fries and a couple cups of soup. I will go there again cause the food was good.
67	4	0	0	0	They have  a menu me and my  family can all enjoy. The Beers on tap were an above average selection.
67	2	0	0	0	Decided to drop in to American TapHouse after it changed from BoomBozz, which I had not visited before. ...  ... The interior appeals to Western theme and some of there menu reflects this. Though, I'll agree the strong point is pizza. Nothing sticks out to be a "must-try" item. We tried the pretzel and cheese appetizer and it was great! Glad to know by Dennis' review that the appetizer really aren't the best deal during happy hour. ...  ... The waitress was attentive. She allowed me to try a variety of beers. The best is Papago Orange Blossom. I didn't notice any lack of experience in their knowledge of beers, but I didn't ask.  ...  ... I tried a pizza and it was great! Pleasant tasting, though I dare say that the ingredients were fresh. My friend had a fish platter and it looked pretty typical- nothing out of this world. Another friend had a burger- he said it was okay. Nothing special. ...  ... Nothing special seems to be the theme. I agree: the restaurant is trying to tap in on the 'craft beer" but added nothing else to the experience. The focus is off point, but I think they are too scared to focus on pizza because that would be reflective of BoomBozz. ...  ... Will I go back to this place? Sure, but mostly for the craft beer. . . which is still not the best priced. The food is just something to have if you're trying to fill your tummy, not if you're trying to have an amazing experience.
67	5	0	0	0	My wife and I enjoyed our experience last night. We've been there a few times, very close biking distance to our house. The bartender is hilarious. My wife, who doesn't drink beer, is hooked on the Orange Blossom. We split a salad that she recommended and it was amazing. We were introduced to other customers and had a great time! Can you write down all 50 states in 5 minutes for a fireball shot? We didn't get a shot, but we will back.
67	4	0	0	0	We love the pizza and wings here. Tony the manager is friendly and sociable. I do not like that one of the managers sits in the bar on his laptop when customers could sit there. A little frustrating that a booth dot for 4 is taken up by one guy with a laptop during Happy Hour. Never been disappointed by the service and we enjoy the atmosphere.
67	4	0	0	0	I hadn't been here nor read any reviews before coming in, so I had no pre-conceived notions.  I did however read some reviews while I was sitting at the table deciding what to order for dinner.  I really didn't get some of the negative comments.  I thought the food was great - at least what I had.  I had the Back Forty individual pizza and their dry rub paprika wings.  Both were delicious.  My wife had the Cubano and loved it!   ...  ... I was especially impressed by two other staff members other than our waitress asking how our food was and if we enjoyed it.  That tells me they care and have pride in what they are serving.  The only negative was that our waitress was not completely attentive.  My wife asked for a box immediately after receiving her food.  It never came and we had to ask for it again at the end of the meal.  It was a small detail but one I felt like should be mentioned.  I hate having to ask for things twice.  It's one of my biggest pet peeves at a restaurant.  She was a good waitress but an great one would have remembered a simple request such as a box.  ...  ... We will definitely be back though when we are in the area.  I definitely recommend you check it out if you have the chance.
67	4	0	1	0	Great happy hour. The prices are unbelivable. Good variety of beers. The 8 inch pizzas for $5 are a steal. 8 wings for $3.
67	5	0	0	0	I had a great time here. Good beer, good music and great service. I'll definitely be back.
67	2	1	2	0	I'm not sure what to say about this place, but it seems that they don't have their stuff together. At a "tap" house my husband and I were sat at table with no drink menu on the table and nor were we offered one- had to ask to see beer selection.  Ok fine- got our beers- Orange Blossom and Kiltlifter. They were good.  Ordered food- pork sliders, stuffed mushroom, wings. The stuffed mushroom was pretty tasty. However the wings were dry and the pork sliders were soggy and seriously tasted like tuna from a can. I'm not really sure how that happens and I don't want to know. My husband ordered a cocktail (amaretto sour) and I tried to warn him that this did not seem like a good cocktail kind of place. I was right, and it was positively terrible. Our server was nice. Overall just an underwhelming experience. Don't have plans to return.
67	1	1	1	0	1 star, because you can't give 0. ... Boombozz was hit or miss depending on the wait staff and cooks.   ... However, American TapHouse had somehow rolled all of the negative's of Boombozz into one. ... EXTREMELY disapponted, especially because it's within walking distance of my home. :(
67	4	0	1	0	This place is great. Had heard from the in-laws that the pizza was fantastic. We went for appetizers and beers and were very pleased with the selection - especially the beer selection. The happy hour specials are fantastic. Will definitely try the pizza next time, as that is their specialty. Yasmin, the bartender, was awesome. We will definitely be back to see her. We appreciate a good beer selection and excellent service above all and were extremely pleased with American Tap House.
67	4	0	0	0	The staff was incredibly friendly & a server other than ours even came by to see how everything was going.  Our server was very polite & because we had never dined here, gave us recommendations that were spot on.  The 4x4 pizza was very tasty & the crust had just the right combination of crispness & taste!  Drinks were filled without being asked & we will definitely be back.  You can even join their VIP text club & receive coupons & specials sent right to your phone.
67	2	1	0	0	Expected a much larger selection of draft beer! Also disappointed that the Mac and Cheese had a spicy nacho cheese taste when the menu said nothing to indicate that flavor. When I asked the waitress about it she said other tables mentioned to get it without the 'beer queso' .. which nobody would know about since it's not mentioned on the menu! Not enough meat on the steak sandwich and no feasible gluten-free options. It was a very clean restaurant - and was overall ok - but we won't be back.
67	5	0	0	0	The staff here are top of the notch. They seem to have loads of fun, and enjoy what they're doing. The dishes are delicious, especially the fries and wings.
68	1	0	2	0	This McDonald's is really bad. They don't even open the play place until almost 11 am even though there are like 10 kids waiting. The manager said she doesn't know when they open. They rang up my order wrong and took forever to figure it out. The dining areas are dirty. What the heck is wrong with this place?!
68	1	0	0	0	Came in here late after the bar ordered some breakfast and some hamburgers because you can get them both at this location it took us 45 minute wait before we got it it was crazy ridiculous. Called the corporate office they said they would take care of the problem Scott in a little bit better but not hundred percent.
68	1	1	1	1	Okay for some reason they cannot get a decent person in the drive-through here that speaks it understands English I got so mad we had to leave because I didn't understand what she was saying this is America I speak English here this is what you need to be speaking if you're working for the public speak and understand English only. So if you don't speak or understand Spanish then I would avoid this drive-through at all cost, I believe it's very important and working with public.
68	1	0	0	0	This place is bad, even for a McDonald's
