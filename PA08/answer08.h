 * 'compar' is a function that is used to compare two nodes. This parameter is
 * similar to the parameter in qsort(...), except that it only compares two
 * strings. You can pass 'strcmp' to this function if you want to sort lists in
 * ascending order.
 *
 * When implementing this function, do not call List_createNode(...) or
 * malloc(...) Instead, think about how to build a new list by:
 * (1) Create a new (empty -- i.e., NULL) list where we build the result. You 
 *     will need to track the first and last node of this list.
 * (2) In a while-loop:
 * (2.a) Use compar to identify whether the front node of lhs or rhs is smaller.
 *       Remember that lhs or rhs could be NULL. 
 * (2.b) Move the front node of 'lhs/rhs' to the end of the result list. 
 *
 * You will need to consider what happens when 'lhs' or 'rhs' becomes NULL.
 *
 * Well-written code should be 20-30 lines long, including comments and spacing.
 * If your code is longer than this, then you may save time by rethinking your
 * approach.

 *
 * (1) Base case: 
 * Lists of length 0 or 1 are already (defacto) sorted. In this case, return
 * 'list'.
 *
 * (2) Recursive case: 
 * (2.a) Split the linked-list into two approx. equal sized lists.
 * (2.b) Call List_sort(...) on each of these smaller lists.
 * (2.c) Call List_merge(...) to merge the now sorted smaller lists into a
