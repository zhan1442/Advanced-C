   Testing List_merge(lhs, rhs, compar), where:
   
   + compar is: return -strcmp(a, b)
   + lhs is: "2010" ==> NULL
   + rhs is: "Yesterday" ==> "Tomorrow" ==> "Name" ==> "Hello" ==> "Doctor" ==> "Continue" ==> NULL
   
   merged is  : "Yesterday" ==> "Tomorrow" ==> "Name" ==> "Hello" ==> "Doctor" ==> "Continue" ==> "2010" ==> NULL
   solution is: "Yesterday" ==> "Tomorrow" ==> "Name" ==> "Hello" ==> "Doctor" ==> "Continue" ==> "2010" ==> NULL
