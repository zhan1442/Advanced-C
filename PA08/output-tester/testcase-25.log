Testcase 25
   Testing List_merge(lhs, rhs, compar), where:
   
   + compar is: return strlen(a) - strlen(b)
   + lhs is: "a" ==> "be" ==> "sea" ==> NULL
   + rhs is: "deee" ==> NULL
   
   merged is  : "a" ==> "be" ==> "sea" ==> "deee" ==> NULL
   solution is: "a" ==> "be" ==> "sea" ==> "deee" ==> NULL
Pass.
