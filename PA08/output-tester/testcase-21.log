Testcase 21
   Testing List_merge(lhs, rhs, compar), where:
   
   + compar is: return -strcmp(a, b)
   + lhs is: "7" ==> "5" ==> "3" ==> "2" ==> NULL
   + rhs is: "23" ==> "19" ==> "17" ==> "13" ==> "11" ==> NULL
   
   merged is  : "7" ==> "5" ==> "3" ==> "23" ==> "2" ==> "19" ==> "17" ==> "13" ==> "11" ==> NULL
   solution is: "7" ==> "5" ==> "3" ==> "23" ==> "2" ==> "19" ==> "17" ==> "13" ==> "11" ==> NULL
Pass.
